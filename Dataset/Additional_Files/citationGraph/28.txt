The number of infected patients in China has increased rapidly and exceeded 60 000 in mid-February 2020. In previous reports, the clinical characteristics of NCP patients have been investigated, the reported mortalities were 4.3%, 11.0%, and 14.6%, respectively; organ dysfunction and coagulopathy were associated with high mortality. However, the complete coagulation parameters of NCP cases were not fully reported, which may have prognostic values and be important therapeutic targets. In this study, the coagulation parameters of consecutive NCP cases in our hospital were shown and the differences between survivors and non-survivors were investigated.\nMETHODS\nConsecutive patients with confirmed NCP admitted to Tongji Hospital of Huazhong University of Science and Technology in Wuhan from January 1 to February 3, 2020, were enrolled. This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Tongji Hospital (Wuhan, China). The diagnosis of NCP was according to World Health Organization interim guidance and confirmed by RNA detection of the 2019-nCoV in the clinical laboratory of Tongji Hospital. The clinical outcomes were monitored up to February 13, 2020.\nThe samples for coagulation tests were collected on admission and during the hospital stay: prothrombin time (PT), activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), antithrombin activity (AT), fibrinogen, fibrin degradation product (FDP), and D-dimer were detected using a STA-R MAX coagulation analyzer and original reagents (Diagnostica Stago, Saint-Denis, France).\nBetween survivors and non-survivors, normally and abnormally distributed quantitative variables were compared using the Student's t test and the Mann-Whitney U test, respectively. Categorical variables were compared using the chi-squared test. The results were given as the mean +- standard deviation, median (interquartile range), or number (percentage), wherever appropriate. A P-value of &lt; .05 was considered statistically significant. Data were analyzed using SPSS 21.0 for Windows (SPSS Inc.).\nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION\nThere were 183 patients (85 females and 98 males) with NCP enrolled into the study, and these patients had complete clinical information and the laboratory data required for this study. The mean age at disease onset was 54.1 years (range, 14-94 years). Seventy-five (41.0%) patients had chronic diseases, including cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases, respiratory system disease, malignant tumor, chronic liver and kidney disease, and others. All patients received antiviral and supportive therapies after diagnosis. By the end of February 13, 78 (42.6%) patients had been discharged and 21 (11.5%) patients had died, the rest 84 (45.9%) of the patients remain hospitalized in stable condition.\nCoagulation parameters of NCP patients on admission\nTable 1	 	\nParameters	Normal range	Total (n = 183)	Survivors (n = 162)	Non-survivors (n = 21)	P values	 	Age (years)		54.1 +- 16.2	52.4 +- 15.6	64.0 +- 20.7	&lt;.001	 	Sex (male/female)		98/85	82/80	16/5	.035	 	With underlying diseases		75 (41.0%)	63 (38.9%)	12 (57.1%)	.156	 	On admission	 	PT (sec)	11.5-14.5	13.7 (13.1-14.6)	13.6 (13.0-14.3)	15.5 (14.4-16.3)	&lt;.001	 	APTT (sec)	29.0-42.0	41.6 (36.9-44.5)	41.2 (36.9-44.0)	44.8 (40.2-51.0)	.096	 	Fibrinogen (g/L)	2.0-4.0	4.55 (3.66-5.17)	4.51 (3.65-5.09)	5.16 (3.74-5.69)	.149	 	D-dimer (microg/mL)	&lt;0.50	0.66 (0.38-1.50)	0.61 (0.35-1.29)	2.12 (0.77-5.27)	&lt;.001	 	FDP (microg/mL)	&lt;5.0	4.0 (4.0-4.9)	4.0 (4.0-4.3)	7.6 (4.0-23.4)	&lt;.001	 	AT (%)	80-120	91 (83-97)	91 (84-97)	84 (78-90)	.096	 	\nAbbreviations: APTT, activated partial thromboplastin time; AT, antithrombin activity; FDP, fibrin degradation product; NCP, novel coronavirus pneumonia; PT, prothrombin time (PT).\nDynamic profile of coagulation parameters in patients with novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP). Timeline charts illustrate the changes of coagulation parameters in 183 patients with NCP (21 non-survivors and 162 survivors) after admission. The error bars show medians and 25% and 75% percentiles. The horizontal lines show the upper normal limits of prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin time, D-dimer and fibrin degradation product, and the lower normal limits of fibrinogen and antithrombin activity, respectively. aP &lt; 0.05 for survivors versus non-survivors\nFigure 1\nThe coagulation parameters on admission between survivors and non-survivors were compared (Table 1 ). Based on our detection system, the reportable range of D-dimer and FDP were 0.22-21.00 microg/mL and 4.0-150.0 microg/mL, respectively. The dynamic changes in coagulation parameters were tracked from day 1 to day 14 after admission at three-day intervals (Figure 1 ).\nThe grade of DIC in non-survivors with NCP (n = 21)\nTable 2	 	\n	Number of patients (%)	 	Platelet counts (x109/L)	 	50-100 (1 point)	7 (33.3)	 	&lt;50 (2 points)	5 (23.8)	 	D-dimer (microg/mL)	 	1.0-3.0 (2 points)	3 (14.3)	 	&gt;3.0 (3 points)	18 (85.7)	 	Fibrinogen (g/L)	 	&lt;1.0 (1 point)	6 (28.6)	 	Prolongation of PT (sec)	 	3-6 (1 point)	5 (23.8)	 	&gt;6 (2 points)	10 (47.6)	 	Meeting the ISTH criteria of DIC (Total points &gt;=5)	15 (71.4)	 	\nNote:D-dimer cutoff levels were defined according to a previous report derived from more than 1000 samples in intensive care.\nAbbreviations: DIC, disseminated intravascular coagulation; ISTH, International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis; NCP, novel coronavirus pneumonia\nAccording to the International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis (ISTH) diagnostic criteria for disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), 15 (71.4%) of the non-survivors matched the grade of overt-DIC (&gt;=5 points) in later stages of NCP (Table 2 ), the median time from admission to DIC was 4 days (range, 1-12 days). On the contrary, only one (0.6%) survivor matched the DIC criteria during hospital stay.\nIn our enrolled patients with NCP, the non-survivors revealed significantly higher D-dimer and FDP levels, and longer PT compared to survivors on admission. By the late hospitalization, the fibrinogen and AT levels were also significantly lower in non-survivors; this suggested that conventional coagulation parameters during the course of NCP were significantly associated with prognosis.\nDIC appeared in most of the deaths. Patients presenting with a virus infection may develop into sepsis associated with organ dysfunction. Sepsis is well established as one of the most common causes of DIC; development of DIC results when monocytes and endothelial cells are activated to the point of cytokine release following injury, with expression of tissue factor and secretion of von Willebrand factor. Circulation of free thrombin, uncontrolled by natural anticoagulants, can activate platelets and stimulate fibrinolysis. At the late stages of NCP, levels of fibrin-related markers (D-dimer and FDP) moderately or markedly elevated in all deaths, which suggested a common coagulation activation and secondary hyperfibrinolysis condition in these patients.\nIn a previous study, Gralinski et al investigated viral pathogenesis and identified a novel host pathway involved in severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-coronavirus disease progression. Their data suggest that dysregulation of the urokinase pathway during SARS-coronavirus infection contributes to more severe lung pathology and that plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 plays a protective role following infection. In addition, Fatma Berri et al reported that plasminogen contributes to inflammation caused by influenza through fibrinolysis, and 6-aminocaproic acid can protect against influenza. Presumably, fibrinolysis may also be induced following severe 2019-nCoV infection.\nThe limitations of this report included that, as a relatively small, single-center study, the mortality and characteristics of enrolled patients may not be representative; our findings should be confirmed in an adequately powered clinical study. In addition, some patients are still hospitalized at the time of manuscript submission. Nonetheless, the present study has shown that existence of DIC is common in deaths with NCP; abnormal coagulation results, especially markedly elevated D-dimer and FDP, may have the potential to guide therapy and evaluate prognosis.\nAUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONS\nN.

the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatment and clinical outcomes of these patients.\n\n\nMethods\nAll patients with suspected 2019-nCoV were admitted to a designated hospital in Wuhan.\n\n We prospectively collected and analysed data on patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection by real-time RT-PCR and next-generation sequencing.\n\n Data were obtained with standardised data collection forms shared by WHO and the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium from electronic medical records.\n\n Researchers also directly communicated with patients or their families to ascertain epidemiological and symptom data.\n\n Outcomes were also compared between patients who had been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and those who had not.\n\n\nFindings\nBy Jan 2, 2020, 41 admitted hospital patients had been identified as having laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection.\n\n Most of the infected patients were men (30 [73%] of 41); less than half had underlying diseases (13 [32%]), including diabetes (eight [20%]), hypertension (six [15%]), and cardiovascular disease (six [15%]).\n\n Median age was 49·0 years (IQR 41·058·0).\n\n 27 (66%) of 41 patients had been exposed to Huanan seafood market.\n\n One family cluster was found.\n\n Common symptoms at onset of illness were fever (40 [98%] of 41 patients), cough (31 [76%]), and myalgia or fatigue (18 [44%]); less common symptoms were sputum production (11 [28%] of 39), headache (three [8%] of 38), haemoptysis (two [5%] of 39), and diarrhoea (one [3%] of 38).\n\n Dyspnoea developed in 22 (55%) of 40 patients (median time from illness onset to dyspnoea 8·0 days [IQR 5·013·0]).\n\n 26 (63%) of 41 patients had lymphopenia.\n\n All 41 patients had pneumonia with abnormal findings on chest CT.\n\n Complications included acute respiratory distress syndrome (12 [29%]), RNAaemia (six [15%]), acute cardiac injury (five [12%]) and secondary infection (four [10%]).\n\n 13 (32%) patients were admitted to an ICU and six (15%) died.\n\n Compared with non-ICU patients, ICU patients had higher plasma levels of IL2, IL7, IL10, GSCF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNF?.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe 2019-nCoV infection caused clusters of severe respiratory illness similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and was associated with ICU admission and high mortality.\n\n Major gaps in our knowledge of the origin, epidemiology, duration of human transmission, and clinical spectrum of disease need fulfilment by future

Of six family members who travelled to Wuhan, five were identified as infected with the novel coronavirus.\n\n Additionally, one family member, who did not travel to Wuhan, became infected with the virus after several days of contact with four of the family members.\n\n None of the family members had contacts with Wuhan markets or animals, although two had visited a Wuhan hospital.\n\n Five family members (aged 3666 years) presented with fever, upper or lower respiratory tract symptoms, or diarrhoea, or a combination of these 36 days after exposure.\n\n They presented to our hospital (The University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen) 610 days after symptom onset.\n\n They and one asymptomatic child (aged 10 years) had radiological ground-glass lung opacities.\n\n Older patients (aged &gt;60 years) had more systemic symptoms, extensive radiological ground-glass lung changes, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and increased C-reactive protein and lactate dehydrogenase levels.\n\n The nasopharyngeal or throat swabs of these six patients were negative for known respiratory microbes by point-of-care multiplex RT-PCR, but five patients (four adults and the child) were RT-PCR positive for genes encoding the internal RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and surface Spike protein of this novel coronavirus, which were confirmed by Sanger sequencing.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these five patients' RT-PCR amplicons and two full genomes by next-generation sequencing showed that this is a novel coronavirus, which is closest to the bat severe acute respiatory syndrome

January 2020. We analyzed data on the first 425 confirmed cases in Wuhan to determine the epidemiologic characteristics of NCIP.\n\n\nMethods\nWe collected information on demographic characteristics, exposure history, and illness timelines of laboratory-confirmed cases of NCIP that had been reported by January 22, 2020. We described characteristics of the cases and estimated the key epidemiologic time-delay distributions.\n\n In the early period of exponential growth, we estimated the epidemic doubling time and the basic reproductive number.\n\n\nResults\nAmong the first 425 patients with confirmed NCIP, the median age was 59 years and 56% were male.\n\n The majority of cases (55%) with onset before January 1, 2020, were linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, as compared with 8.6% of the subsequent cases.\n\n The mean incubation period was 5.2 days (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.1 to 7.0), with the 95th percentile of the distribution at 12.5 days.\n\n In its early stages, the epidemic doubled in size every 7.4 days.\n\n With a mean serial interval of 7.5 days (95% CI, 5.3 to 19), the basic reproductive number was estimated to be 2.2 (95% CI, 1.4 to 3.9).\n\n\nConclusions\nOn the basis of this information, there is evidence that human-to-human transmission has occurred among close contacts since the middle of December 2019.

outcomes in patients with a number of different malignancies.\n\n The objective of this study was to assess the relationship between NLR and mortality in a population of adult critically ill patients.\n\n\nMethods\nWe performed an observational cohort study of unselected intensive care unit (ICU) patients based on records in a large clinical database.\n\n We computed individual patient NLR and categorized patients by quartile of this ratio.\n\n The association of NLR quartiles and 28-day mortality was assessed using multivariable logistic regression.\n\n Secondary outcomes included mortality in the ICU, in-hospital mortality and 1-year mortality.\n\n An a priori subgroup analysis of patients with versus without sepsis was performed to assess any differences in the relationship between the NLR and outcomes in these cohorts.\n\n\nResults\nA total of 5,056 patients were included.\n\n Their 28-day mortality rate was 19%.\n\n The median age of the cohort was 65 years, and 47% were female.\n\n The median NLR for the entire cohort was 8.9 (interquartile range, 4.99 to 16.21).\n\n Following multivariable adjustments, there was a stepwise increase in mortality with increasing quartiles of NLR (first quartile: reference category; second quartile odds ratio (OR) = 1.32; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.03 to 1.71; third quartile OR = 1.43; 95% CI, 1.12 to 1.83; 4th quartile OR = 1.71; 95% CI, 1.35 to 2.16).\n\n A similar stepwise relationship was identified in the subgroup of patients who presented without sepsis.\n\n The NLR was not associated with 28-day mortality in

recently reported in Wuhan, Hubei province, China.\n As of 25 January 2020, at least 1,975 cases had been reported since the first patient was hospitalized on 12 December 2019. Epidemiological investigations have suggested that the outbreak was associated with a seafood market in Wuhan.\n Here we study a single patient who was a worker at the market and who was admitted to the Central Hospital of Wuhan on 26 December 2019 while experiencing a severe respiratory syndrome that included fever, dizziness and a cough.\n Metagenomic RNA sequencing4 of a sample of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from the patient identified a new RNA virus strain from the family Coronaviridae, which is designated here WH-Human 1 coronavirus (and has also been referred to as 2019-nCoV).\n Phylogenetic analysis of the complete viral genome (29,903 nucleotides) revealed that the virus was most closely related (89.1% nucleotide similarity) to a group of SARS-like

cells: pluripotency and self-renewal.\n\n Current efforts focus on identifying genes that play important roles in maintaining pluripotency and self-renewal in ES cells and aim to understand the interactions among these genes.\n\n To that end, we investigated the use of unsigned and signed network analysis to identify pluripotency and differentiation related genes.\n\n\nResults\nWe show that signed networks provide a better systems level understanding of the regulatory mechanisms of ES cells than unsigned networks, using two independent murine ES cell expression data sets.\n\n Specifically, using signed weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA), we found a pluripotency module and a differentiation module, which are not identified in unsigned networks.\n\n We confirmed the importance of these modules by incorporating genome-wide TF binding data for key ES cell regulators.\n\n Interestingly, we find that the pluripotency module is enriched with genes related to DNA damage repair and mitochondrial function in addition to transcriptional regulation.\n\n Using a connectivity measure of module membership, we not only identify known regulators of ES cells but also show that Mrpl15, Msh6, Nrf1, Nup133, Ppif, Rbpj, Sh3gl2, and Zfp39, among other genes, have important roles in maintaining ES cell pluripotency and self-renewal.\n\n We also report highly significant relationships between module membership and epigenetic modifications (histone modifications and promoter CpG methylation status), which are known to play a role in controlling gene expression during ES cell self-renewal and differentiation.\n\n\nConclusion\nOur systems biologic re-analysis of gene expression, transcription factor binding, epigenetic and gene ontology data

complicates pathogenesis studies.\n We adapted the SARS-CoV (Urbani strain) by serial passage in the respiratory tract of young BALB/c mice.\n Fifteen passages resulted in a virus (MA15) that is lethal for mice following intranasal inoculation.\n Lethality is preceded by rapid and high titer viral replication in lungs, viremia, and dissemination of virus to extrapulmonary sites accompanied by lymphopenia, neutrophilia, and pathological changes in the lungs.\n Abundant viral antigen is extensively distributed in bronchial epithelial cells and alveolar pneumocytes, and necrotic cellular debris is present in airways and alveoli, with only mild and focal pneumonitis.\n These observations suggest that mice infected with MA15 die from an overwhelming viral infection with extensive, virally mediated destruction of pneumocytes and ciliated epithelial cells.\n The MA15 virus has six coding mutations associated with adaptation and increased virulence; when introduced into a recombinant SARS-CoV, these mutations result in a highly virulent and lethal virus (rMA15), duplicating the phenotype of the biologically derived MA15 virus.\n Intranasal inoculation with MA15 reproduces many aspects of disease seen in severe human cases of SARS.\n The availability of the MA15 virus will enhance the use of the mouse model for SARS because infection with MA15 causes morbidity, mortality, and pulmonary pathology.\n This virus will be of value as a stringent challenge in evaluation of the efficacy of vaccines and antivirals.\n","id":"PMC1769406","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Public Library of

diseases and death are unknown.\n To address this question, we evaluated the role of innate immune signaling in protection from human (Urbani) and a recombinant mouse adapted SARS-CoV, designated rMA15. In contrast to most models of viral pathogenesis, infection of type I, type II or type III interferon knockout mice (129 background) with either Urbani or MA15 viruses resulted in clinical disease outcomes, including transient weight loss, denuding bronchiolitis and alveolar inflammation and recovery, identical to that seen in infection of wildtype mice.\n This suggests that type I, II and III interferon signaling play minor roles in regulating SARS pathogenesis in mouse models.\n In contrast, infection of STAT1?/? mice resulted in severe disease, high virus titer, extensive pulmonary lesions and 100% mortality by day 9 and 30 post-infection with rMA15 or Urbani viruses, respectively.\n Non-lethal in BALB/c mice, Urbani SARS-CoV infection in STAT1?/? mice caused disseminated infection involving the liver, spleen and other tissues after day 9. These findings demonstrated that SARS-CoV pathogenesis is regulated by a STAT1 dependent but type I, II and III interferon receptor independent, mechanism.\n In contrast to a well documented role in

more than 700 deaths worldwide.\n Since most animal models fail to faithfully recapitulate the clinical course of SARS-CoV in humans, the virus and host factors that mediate disease pathogenesis remain unclear.\n Recently, our laboratory and others developed a recombinant mouse-adapted SARS-CoV (rMA15) that was lethal in BALB/c mice.\n In contrast, intranasal infection of young 10-week-old C57BL/6 mice with rMA15 results in a nonlethal infection characterized by high titer replication within the lungs, lung inflammation, destruction of lung tissue, and loss of body weight, thus providing a useful model to identify host mediators of protection.\n Here, we report that mice deficient in MyD88 (MyD88?/?), an adapter protein that mediates Toll-like receptor (TLR), IL-1R, and IL-18R signaling, are far more susceptible to rMA15 infection.\n The genetic absence of MyD88 resulted in enhanced pulmonary pathology and greater than 90% mortality by day 6 post-infection.\n MyD88?/? mice had significantly higher viral loads in lung tissue throughout the course of infection.\n Despite increased viral loads, the expression of multiple proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines within lung tissue and recruitment of inflammatory monocytes/macrophages to the lung was severely impaired in MyD88?/? mice compared to wild-type mice.\n Furthermore, mice deficient in chemokine receptors that contribute to monocyte recruitment to the lung were more susceptible to rMA15-induced disease and exhibited severe lung pathology similar to that seen in MyD88?/?mice.\n These data suggest that MyD88-mediated innate immune signaling and inflammatory cell recruitment to the lung are required for protection from lethal rMA15

clinical data on H5N1 cases are limited.\n\n We conducted a retrospective study of 26 confirmed human H5N1 cases identified through surveillance in China from October 2005 through April 2008.\nMethodology/Principal Findings\nData were collected from hospital medical records of H5N1 cases and analyzed.\n\n The median age was 29 years (range 662) and 58% were female.\n\n Many H5N1

Clinical complications included acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS, 81%), cardiac failure (50%), elevated aminotransaminases (43%), and renal dysfunction (17%).\n\n Fatal cases had a lower median nadir platelet count (64.5×109 cells/L vs 93.0×109 cells/L, p?=?0.02), higher median peak lactic dehydrogenase (LDH) level (1982.5 U/L vs 1230.0 U/L, p?=?0.001), higher percentage of ARDS (94%

pneumonia in humans.\n The pathogenesis of HPAIV H5N1 infection is not completely understood, although the alveolar macrophage (AM) is thought to play an important role.\n HPAIV H5N1 infection of macrophages cultured from monocytes leads to high percentages of infection accompanied by virus production and an excessive pro-inflammatory immune response.\n However, macrophages cultured from monocytes are different from AM, both in phenotype and in response to seasonal influenza virus infection.\n Consequently, it remains unclear whether the results of studies with macrophages cultured from monocytes are valid for AM.\n Therefore we infected AM and for comparison macrophages cultured from monocytes with seasonal H3N2 virus, HPAIV H5N1 or pandemic H1N1 virus, and determined the percentage of cells infected, virus production and induction of TNF-alpha, a pro-inflammatory cytokine.\n In vitro HPAIV H5N1 infection of AM compared to that of macrophages cultured from monocytes resulted in a lower percentage of infected cells (up to 25% vs up to 84%), lower virus production and lower TNF-alpha induction.\n In vitro infection of AM with H3N2 or H1N1 virus resulted in even lower percentages of infected cells (up to 7%) than with HPAIV H5N1, while virus production and TNF-alpha induction were comparable.\n In conclusion, this study reveals that macrophages cultured from monocytes are not a good model to study the interaction between AM and these influenza virus strains.\n Furthermore, the interaction between HPAIV H5N1 and AM could contribute to the pathogenicity of this virus in humans, due to the relative high percentage of infected cells rather than virus production or an excessive TNF-alpha

pandemic influenza virus and potentially pandemic H5N1 viruses is characterized by severe lung pathology, including pulmonary edema and extensive inflammatory infiltrate.\n Here, we quantified the cellular immune response to infection in the mouse lung by flow cytometry and demonstrate that mice infected with highly pathogenic (HP) H1N1 and H5N1 influenza viruses exhibit significantly high numbers of macrophages and neutrophils in the lungs compared to mice infected with low pathogenic (LP) viruses.\n Mice infected with the 1918 pandemic virus and a recent H5N1 human isolate show considerable similarities in overall lung cellularity, lung immune cell sub-population composition and cellular immune temporal dynamics.\n Interestingly, while these similarities were observed, the

pathogenesis of H5N1 infections.\n These results together show that infection with HP influenza viruses such as H5N1 and the 1918 pandemic virus leads to a rapid cell recruitment of macrophages and neutrophils into the lungs, suggesting that these cells play a role in acute lung inflammation associated with HP influenza virus infection.\n In addition, primary macrophages and dendritic cells were also susceptible to 1918 and H5N1 influenza virus infection in vitro and in infected mouse lung tissue.\n","id":"PMC2483250","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Public Library of

the ability of the virus to circumvent innate immunity.\n Using functional genomics, we analyzed early host responses to SARS-CoV infection in the lungs of adolescent cynomolgus macaques (Macaca fascicularis) that show lung pathology similar to that observed in human adults with SARS.\n Analysis of gene signatures revealed induction of a strong innate immune response characterized by the stimulation of various cytokine and chemokine genes, including interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, and IP-10, which corresponds to the host response seen in acute respiratory distress syndrome.\n As opposed to many in vitro experiments, SARS-CoV induced a wide range of type I interferons (IFNs) and nuclear translocation of phosphorylated signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 in the lungs of

have yet to be identified.\n Here we show that loss of deubiquitinase CYLD led to the development of lung fibrosis in mice after infection with Streptococcus pneumoniae.\n CYLD inhibited transforming

Smad3 stability by deubiquitinating K63-polyubiquitinated Akt.\n Together, our results unveil a role for CYLD in tightly regulating the resolution of lung injury and preventing fibrosis by

Efficacy in Senescent Mice Challenged with Recombinant SARS-CoV Bearing Epidemic and Zoonotic Spike Variants ","abstract":"Background\nIn 2003, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) was identified as the etiological agent of severe acute respiratory syndrome, a disease characterized by severe pneumonia that sometimes results in death.\n\n SARS-CoV is a zoonotic virus that crossed the species barrier, most likely originating from bats or from other species including civets, raccoon dogs, domestic cats, swine, and rodents.\n\n A SARS-CoV vaccine should confer long-term protection, especially in vulnerable senescent populations, against both the 2003 epidemic strains and zoonotic strains that may yet emerge from animal reservoirs.\n\n We report the comprehensive investigation of SARS vaccine efficacy in young and senescent mice following homologous and heterologous challenge.\n\n\nMethods and Findings\nUsing Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus replicon particles (VRP) expressing the 2003 epidemic Urbani SARS-CoV strain spike (S) glycoprotein (VRP-S) or the nucleocapsid (N) protein from the same strain (VRP-N), we demonstrate that VRP-S, but not VRP-N vaccines provide complete short- and long-term protection against homologous strain challenge in young and senescent mice.\n\n To test VRP vaccine efficacy against a heterologous SARS-CoV, we used phylogenetic analyses, synthetic biology, and reverse genetics to construct a chimeric virus (icGDO3-S) encoding a synthetic S glycoprotein gene of the most genetically divergent human strain, GDO3, which clusters among the zoonotic SARS-CoV.\n\n icGD03-S replicated efficiently in human airway epithelial cells and in the lungs of young and senescent mice, and was highly resistant to neutralization with antisera directed against the Urbani strain.\n\n Although VRP-S vaccines provided complete short-term protection against heterologous icGD03-S challenge in young mice, only limited protection was seen in vaccinated senescent animals.\n\n VRP-N vaccines not only failed to protect from homologous or heterologous challenge, but resulted in enhanced immunopathology with eosinophilic infiltrates within the lungs of SARS-CoVchallenged mice.\n\n VRP-Ninduced pathology presented at day 4, peaked around day 7, and persisted through day 14, and was likely mediated by cellular immune responses.\n\n\nConclusions\nThis study identifies gaps and challenges in vaccine design for controlling future SARS-CoV zoonosis, especially in vulnerable elderly populations.\n\n The availability of a SARS-CoV virus bearing heterologous S glycoproteins provides a robust challenge inoculum for evaluating vaccine efficacy against zoonotic strains, the most likely source of future outbreaks.\n\n\n","id":"PMC1716185","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Public Library of

With the spread of the disease, such cases have also been found in other parts of China and abroad. As of February 2, 2020, there are more than 14,000 confirmed cases and more than 300 deaths. The 2019-nCoV is considered a relative of the deadly severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronaviruses. Current study showed that 2019-nCov was more closely related to bat-SL-CoV ZC45 and bat-SL-CoV ZXC21.\nRecent studies revealed that 2019-nCoV could spread from human to human, mainly through respiratory droplets, and also through contact. The incubation period is generally 3-7 days, the longest not more than 14 days. Fever, fatigue, and dry cough are the main symptoms. A few patients have symptoms such as nasal congestion, runny nose, and diarrhea. In severe cases, dyspnea occurs more than a week later. In severe cases, acute respiratory distress syndrome, septic shock, difficult to correct metabolic acidosis, and coagulation dysfunction develop rapidly. The confirmed diagnosis of 2019-nCoV infection requires viral nucleic acid detection in throat swabs, sputum, lower respiratory tract secretions, or blood, and the specificity is strong but the sensitivity is poor. According to current experience, lung imaging manifests earlier than clinical symptoms, so imaging examination is vital in preclinical screening. Currently, high-resolution CT (HRCT) is of outstanding importance as it is the main tool for screening, primary diagnosis, and evaluation of disease severity.\nThere are few studies on imaging of 2019-nCoV pneumonia so far. In this study, chest HRCT images of 63 confirmed patients were collected to observe the patients' CT manifestations.\nMaterials and methods\nPopulation and CT image data acquisition\nSixty-three confirmed patients were enrolled from December 30, 2019 to January 31, 2020. CT (CT HD750 Discovery, GE) examination follows the common chest protocol: the patient is installed in a supine position, arms raised. The patient is instructed to hold their breath during acquisition, that includes whole lung volume. Overall scan time is 2 s, and slice thickness for reconstruction is 1.25 mm.\nQualitative image analysis\nThe main analysis criteria are the number of affected lobes, presence of ground glass nodules (GGO), patchy/punctate ground glass opacities, patchy consolidation, fibrous stripes, and irregular solid nodules in each patient's chest CT image.\nStatistical analysis\nStatistical analysis was performed on SPSS 17.0 (IBM Corporation).

Nineteen (30.2%) patients had 1 affected lobe, 5 (7.9%) patients had 2 affected lobes, 4 (6.3%) patients had 3 affected lobes, 7 (11.1%) patients had 4 affected lobes, while 28 (44.4%) patients had 5 affected lobes. Fourteen (22.2%) patients had GGO, 54 (85.7%) patients had patchy/punctate ground glass opacities, 12 (19.0%) patients had patchy consolidation, 11 (17.5%) patients had fibrous stripes, and 8 (12.7%) patients had irregular solid nodules. Various lesions were shown in the Fig. 1. We also re-examined CT of these patients with an interval of 3-14 days. It was found that 54 (85.7%) patients progressed, including a single with increasing GGO, enlarged and consolidated, enlarged fibrous stripes, while solid nodules increased and enlarged (Fig. 2).\nDiscussion\nCoronavirus is a large RNA virus family. Six subtypes have been identified in the past, including SARS and MERS. 2019-nCoV is a new subtype whose genetic structure is 82% similar to SARS-CoV. The source of infection is wild animals, which may be Chinese chrysanthemum head bats or snakes. 2019-nCoV can be transmitted through droplets or contact, and may also be transmitted through the fecal-oral route, with a high incidence and rapid infection, posing a huge threat to global public health. Therefore, detecting the disease accurately and quickly is of great significance. Chest HRCT is an important screening tool for 2019-nCoV due to its high sensitivity and convenience. This study collected 63 confirmed new coronavirus pneumonia patients' chest CT to analyze their imaging manifestations.\nThe imaging manifestations of the new coronavirus pneumonia are similar to common viral pneumonia, but also have its own imaging characteristics. In our study, patients may have a single lobe or multiple lobes involvement; 30.2% of patients had only one lobe involved, and 44.4% had all lobes involvement. This study shows that the most common manifestations of new coronavirus pneumonia are patchy/punctate ground glass opacities (85.7%), patchy consolidation (19.0%), and mainly distributed in a sub-pleural area (Fig. 1c-f); chest CT of the patients for re-examination after 3-14 days were also observed. It was found that, as the disease progressed, the range of ground glass density patches and consolidation increased (Fig. 2a1, a2), which were mainly distributed in the middle and outer zones of the lung. When patients' condition would improve, a little fibrous stripe may appear. Conversely, when patients' condition worsened, the lungs showed diffuse lesions, and the density of both lungs increased widely, showing a &quot;white lung&quot; appearance, which seriously affects the patient's lung function. It is worth noting that only a single GGO can be seen in some patients at an early stage, and the range significantly increases in the short-term re-examination (Fig. 2a1, a2). In some patients, even if only few fibrous stripes are seen at an early stage, consolidation can develop in the short-term reexamination (Fig. 2b1, b2). In some patients with irregular solid nodules of varying sizes at the early stage, re-examination CT showed that the nodules increased, enlarged, and merged; the density of some solid nodules is reduced, showing a ground glass density, like &quot;melting sugar&quot; (Fig. 2c1-d2).\nOur observation is that the manifestations of the new coronavirus pneumonia are diverse. Some patients show changes similar to typical viral pneumonia. Some patients have specific imaging features and the patients' images change rapidly. The purpose of this study is to help early diagnosis based on imaging findings, and to participate in controlling the outbreak by effective countermeasures.\nAbbreviations\nGGO\nGround glass nodules\nHRCT\nHigh-resolution computed tomography\nMERS\nMiddle East respiratory syndrome\nSARS\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome\nThe first authorship is shared by Yueying Pan and Hanxiong Guan and the corresponding authorship is shared by Qiongjie Hu and Liming Xia.\nPlease note that due to the time sensitive nature of the work presented in this article, standard peer-review has been bypassed to ensure rapid publication.

Here we describe efforts to compile and disseminate epidemiological information on COVID-19 from news media and social networks.\nMethods\nIn this population-level observational study, we searched DXY.cn, a health-care-oriented social network that is currently streaming news reports on COVID-19 from local and national Chinese health agencies. We compiled a list of individual patients with COVID-19 and daily province-level case counts between Jan 13 and Jan 31, 2020, in China. We also compiled a list of internationally exported cases of COVID-19 from global news media sources (Kyodo News, The Straits Times, and CNN), national governments, and health authorities. We assessed trends in the epidemiology of COVID-19 and studied the outbreak progression across China, assessing delays between symptom onset, seeking care at a hospital or clinic, and reporting, before and after Jan 18, 2020, as awareness of the outbreak increased. All data were made publicly available in real time.\nFindings\nWe collected data for 507 patients with COVID-19 reported between Jan 13 and Jan 31, 2020, including 364 from mainland China and 143 from outside of China. 281 (55%) patients were male and the median age was 46 years (IQR 35-60). Few patients (13 [3%]) were younger than 15 years and the age profile of Chinese patients adjusted for baseline demographics confirmed a deficit of infections among children. Across the analysed period, delays between symptom onset and seeking care at a hospital or clinic were longer in Hubei province than in other provinces in mainland China and internationally. In mainland China, these delays decreased from 5 days before Jan 18, 2020, to 2 days thereafter until Jan 31, 2020 (p=0 0009). Although our sample captures only 507 (5 2%) of 9826 patients with COVID-19 reported by official sources during the analysed period, our data align with an official report published by Chinese authorities on Jan 28, 2020.\nInterpretation\nNews reports and social media can help reconstruct the progression of an outbreak and provide detailed patient-level data in the context of a health emergency. The availability of a central physician-oriented social network facilitated the compilation of publicly available COVID-19 data in China. As the outbreak progresses, social media and news reports will probably capture a diminishing fraction of COVID-19 cases globally due to reporting fatigue and overwhelmed health-care systems. In the early stages of an outbreak, availability of public datasets is important to encourage analytical efforts by independent teams and provide robust evidence to guide interventions.\nFunding\nFogarty International Center, US National Institutes of Health.\nIntroduction\nAs the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is rapidly expanding in China and beyond, with the potential to become a worldwide pandemic, real-time analyses of epidemiological data are needed to increase situational awareness and inform interventions. Previously, real-time analyses have shed light on the transmissibility, severity, and natural history of an emerging pathogen in the first few weeks of an outbreak, such as with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), the 2009 influenza pandemic, and Ebola. Analyses of detailed line lists of patients are particularly useful to infer key epidemiological parameters, such as the incubation and infectious periods, and delays between infection and detection, isolation, and reporting of cases. However, official individual patient data rarely become publicly available early on in an outbreak, when the information is most needed.\nBuilding on our previous experience collating news reports to monitor transmission of Ebola virus, here we present an effort to compile individual patient information and subnational epidemic curves on COVID-19 from a variety of online resources. Data were made publicly available in real time and were used by the infectious disease modelling community to generate and compare epidemiological estimates relevant to interventions. We describe the data generation process and provide an early analysis of age patterns of COVID-19, case counts across China and internationally, and delays between symptom onset, admissions to hospital, and reporting, for cases reported until Jan 31, 2020.\nResearch in context\n Evidence before this study \nAn outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was recognised in early January, 2020, in Wuhan City, Hubei province, China. The new virus is thought to have originated from an animal-to-human spillover event linked to seafood and live-animal markets. The infection has spread locally in Wuhan and elsewhere in China, despite strict intervention measures implemented in the region where the infection originated on Jan 23, 2020. More than 500 patients infected with COVID-19 outside of mainland China have been reported between Jan 1 and Feb 14, 2020. Although laboratory testing for COVID-19 quickly ramped up in China and elsewhere, information on individual patients remains scarce and official datasets have not been made publicly available. Patient-level information is important to estimate key time-to-delay events (such as the incubation period and interval between symptom onset and visit to a hospital), analyse the age profile of infected patients, reconstruct epidemic curves by onset dates, and infer transmission parameters. We searched PubMed for publications between Jan 1, 1990, and Feb 6, 2020, using combinations of the following terms: (&quot;coronavirus&quot; OR &quot;2019-nCoV&quot;) AND (&quot;line list&quot; OR &quot;case description&quot; OR &quot;patient data&quot;) AND (&quot;digital surveillance&quot; OR &quot;social media&quot; OR &quot;crowd-sourced data&quot;). The search retrieved one relevant study on Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus that mentioned FluTrackers in their discussion, a website that aggregates epidemiological information on emerging pathogens. However, FluTrackers does not report individual-level data on COVID-19.\n Added value of this study \nTo our knowledge, this is the first study that uses crowdsourced data from social media sources to monitor the COVID-19 outbreak. We searched DXY.cn, a Chinese health-care-oriented social network that broadcasts information from local and national health authorities, to reconstruct patient-level information on COVID-19 in China. We also queried international media sources and national health agency websites to collate data on international exportations of COVID-19. We describe the demographic characteristics, delays between symptom onset, seeking care at a hospital or clinic, and reporting for 507 patients infected with COVID-19 reported until Jan 31, 2020. The overall cumulative progression of the outbreak is consistent between our line list and an official report published by the Chinese national health authorities on Jan 28, 2020. The estimated incubation period in our data aligns with that of previous work. Our dataset was made available in the public domain on Jan 21, 2020.\n Implications of all the available evidence \nCrowdsourced line-list data can be reconstructed from social media data, especially when a central resource is available to curate relevant information. Public access to line lists is important so that several teams with different expertise can provide their own insights and interpretations of the data, especially in the early phase of an outbreak when little information is available. Publicly available line lists can also increase transparency. The main issue with the quality of patient-level data obtained during health emergencies is the potential lack of information from locations overwhelmed by the outbreak (in this case, Hubei province and other provinces with weaker health infrastructures). Future studies based on larger samples of patients with COVID-19 could explore in more detail the transmission dynamics of the outbreak in different locations, the effectiveness of interventions, and the demographic factors driving transmission.\nMethods\nStudy design and Chinese data sources\nIn this population-level observational study, we used crowdsourced reports from DXY.cn, a social network for Chinese physicians, health-care professionals, pharmacies, and health-care facilities established in 2000. This online platform is providing real-time coverage of the COVID-19 outbreak in China, obtained by collating and curating reports from news media, government television, and national and provincial health agencies. The information reported includes time-stamped cumulative counts of COVID-19 infections, outbreak maps, and real-time streaming of health authority announcements in Chinese (directly or through state media). Every report is linked to an online source, which can be accessed for more detailed information on individual cases.\nThese are publicly available, de-identified patient data reported directly by public health authorities or by state media. No patient consent was needed and no ethics approval was required.\nData compilation\nWe closely monitored updates on DXY.cn between Jan 20, 2020, and Jan 31, 2020, to extract key information on individual patients in near real-time, and reports of daily case counts. For individual-level patient data, we used descriptions from the original source in Chinese to retrieve age, sex, province of identification, travel history, reporting date, dates of symptom onset and seeking care at a hospital or clinic, and discharge status, when available. Individual-level patient data were formatted into a line-list database for further quantitative analysis. Individual-level patient data were entered from DXY.cn by a native Chinese speaker (KS), who also generated an English summary for each patient. Entries were checked by a second person (JC). Since DXY.cn primarily provides information on patients reported in China, we also compiled additional information on internationally exported cases of COVID-19. We obtained data for 21 countries outside of mainland China (Australia, Cambodia, Canada, France, Germany, Hong Kong, India, Italy, Japan, Malaysia, Nepal, Russia, Singapore, South Korea, Sri Lanka, Taiwan, Thailand, United Arab Emirates, the UK, the USA, and Vietnam). We gathered and cross-checked data for infected patients outside of China using several sources, including global news media (Kyodo News, Straits Times, and CNN), official press releases from each country's Ministry of Health, and disease control agencies.\nIn addition to detailed information on individual patients, we reconstructed the daily progression of reported patients in each province of China from Jan 13, until Jan 31, 2020. We used the daily outbreak situation reports communicated by provincial health authorities, covered by state television and media, and posted on DXY.cn. All patients in our databases had a laboratory confirmed SARS coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection.\nOur COVID-19 database was made publicly available as a Google Sheet, disseminated via Twitter on Jan 21, 2020, and posted on the website of Northeastern University, (Boston, MA, USA) on Jan 24, 2020, where it is updated in real time. Data used in this analysis, frozen at Jan 31, 2020, are available online as a spreadsheet.\nStatistical analysis\nWe assessed the age distribution of all patients with COVID-19 by discharge status. We adjusted the age profile of Chinese patients by the population of China. We used 2016 population estimates from the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation to calculate the relative risk (RR) of infection with COVID-19 by age group. To calculate the RR, we followed the method used by Lemaitre and colleagues to explore the age profile of influenza, where RR for age group i is defined as\nwhere C i is the number of cases in age group i and N i is the population size of age group i.\nTo estimate trends in the strength of case detection and interventions, we analysed delays between symptom onset and visit to a health-care provider, at a hospital or clinic, and from seeking care at a hospital or clinic to reporting, by time period and location. We considered the period before and after Jan 18, 2020, when media attention and awareness of the outbreak became more pronounced. We used non-parametric tests to assess differences in delays between seeking care at a hospital or clinic and reporting between locations (Wilcoxon test to compare two locations and Kruskall-Wallis test to compare three or more locations).\nWe estimated the duration of the incubation period on the basis of our line list data. We analysed a subset of patients returning from Wuhan who had spent less than a week in Wuhan, to ensure a narrowly defined exposure window. The incubation period was estimated as the midpoint between the time spent in Wuhan and the date of symptom onset.\nWe did all analyses in R (version 3.5.3). We considered p values of less than 0 05 to be significant.\nRole of the funding source\nThe funder had no role in study design, data compilation, data analysis, data interpretation, or writing of the report. All authors had access to the data, and had final responsibility for the decision to submit for publication.\nResults\nCharacteristics of patients with COVID-19 included in the crowdsourced line list\n		Patients (n=507)	 	Age, years	46 (35-60)	 	Sex	 		Male	281 (55%)	 		Female	201 (40%)	 		Data missing	25 (5%)	 	Location	 		Mainland China	364 (72%)	 		Beijing	133 (26%)	 		Shaanxi	87 (17%)	 		Hubei*	41 (8%)	 		Tianjin	22 (4%)	 		Yunnan	19 (4%)	 	International cases, reported outside of mainland China	143 (28%)	 	Relation to Wuhan	 		Visited Wuhan	153 (30%)	 		Resident of Wuhan	152 (30%)	 		None	80 (16%)	 		Unknown 	122 (24%)	 	Disease outcome: death at time of reporting	40 (8%)	 	\nData are median (IQR) or n (%). Data are publicly available on the Laboratory for the Modeling of Biological + Socio-technical systems website and on our frozen spreadsheet. COVID-19=coronavirus disease 2019.\nIncluding 32 from Wuhan.\nAll patients with unknown relation to Wuhan were reported by Beijing Municipal Health Commission, Beijing, China.\nOur line list comprised 507 patients reported from Jan 13, to Jan 31, 2020, including 364 (72%) from mainland China and 143 (28%) from outside of China (table ). Our sample captured 5 2% of 9826 COVID-19 cases reported by WHO on Jan 31, 2020. The sex ratio was skewed towards males. In mainland China, five of 30 provinces were represented, with 133 (26%) patients reported by Beijing, 87 (17%) by Shaanxi, 41 (8%) by Hubei (capital city is Wuhan), 19 (4%) by Tianjin, and 22 (4%) by Yunnan. Of 435 patients with known relation to Wuhan city, most reported a travel history to the city (135 [30%]) or were residents of the city (152 [30%]), while 80 (16%) had no direct relation to the city. 122 (24%) patients, all reported in Beijing, had no information about their recent history with Wuhan.\nAge distribution of patients with COVID-19 from crowdsourced data\n(A) All 507 cases by disease outcome (alive or unknown or deceased at time of reporting); vertical bars are case counts in each age group and the dotted lines show the median age for patients who were alive or with unknown outcomes at the time of reporting and those who had died at the time of reporting. (B) Relative risk by 5-year age band for 364 cases reported in China. The observed data are shown by bars and the estimated relative risk is shown by datapoints and a spline-smoothed curve. COVID-19=coronavirus disease 2019.\nThe age distribution of COVID-19 cases was skewed towards older age groups with a median age of 45 years (IQR 33-56) for patients who were alive or who had an unknown outcome at the time of reporting (figure 1 ). The median age of patients who had died at the time of reporting was 70 years (IQR 65-81). Few patients (13 [3%]) were younger than 15 years. Adjustment for the age demographics of China confirmed a deficit of infections among children, with a RR below 0 5 in patients younger than 15 years (figure 1). The RR measure indicated a sharp increase in the likelihood of reported COVID-19 among people aged 30 years and older.\nDaily timeline of the COVID-19 epidemic based on crowdsourced data and official sources, by location\nAll data are by date of symptom onset. Cumulative curves are shown for the official China CDC data (published on Jan 28, 2020), and for the crowdsourced data. Crowdsourced data have been rescaled and multiplied by 20 to enable clear comparison with the official China CDC data. Histograms are daily case count, based on crowdsourced data for Hubei province, mainland China non-Hubei province, and cases outside of mainland China. CDC=Centers for Disease Control. COVID-19=coronavirus disease 2019.\nA timeline of cases in our crowdsourced patient line list is shown by date of onset in figure 2 , indicating an acceleration of reported cases by Jan 13, 2020. The outbreak progression based on the crowdsourced patient line list was consistent with the timeline published by China Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) on Jan 28, 2020, which is based on a more comprehensive database of more than 6000 patients with COVID-19. Since Jan 23, 2020, the cumulative number of cases has slowed down in the crowdsourced and China CDC curves (figure 2), which probably reflects the delay between disease onset and reporting. The median reporting delay was 5 days (IQR 3-8) in our data.\nDaily timeline of the COVID-19 epidemic at the provincial level in China, during January, 2020\nVertical bars show the daily counts of new reported cases, with provinces sorted by total number of reported cases. The timeline for each province is reconstructed on the basis of daily outbreak situation reports provided by provincial health authorities and posted on DXY.cn and are true as of Jan 31, 2020. COVID-19=coronavirus disease 2019.\nProvince-level epidemic curves are shown by reporting date in figure 3 . As of Jan 31, 2020, 16 (52%) of 30 provinces in mainland China had reported more than 100 confirmed cases. The apparent rapid growth of newly reported cases between Jan 18, and Jan 31, 2020, in several provinces outside of Hubei province is consistent with sustained local transmission.\nDelay between symptom onset and seeking care at a hospital or clinic (A) and between seeking care at a hospital or clinic and reporting (B) of COVID-19 cases, by location\nData are for the entire study period and include all cases reported between Jan 13 and Jan 31, 2020. Datapoints are medians, with the spread of data indicated by the filled shapes. All time intervals significantly differ between locations (Kruskall Wallis test, p&lt;0 0001). COVID-19=coronavirus disease 2019.\nAcross the study period, the median delay between symptom onset and seeking care at a hospital or clinic was 2 days (IQR 0-5 days) in mainland China (figure 4 ). This delay decreased from 5 days before Jan 18, 2020, to 2 days thereafter (Wilcoxon test p=0 0009). Some provinces, such as Tianjin and Yunnan had shorter delays (data by province not shown), while the early cases from Hubei province were characterised by longer delays in seeking care (median 0 days [IQR 0-1]).\nThe median delay between seeking care at a hospital or clinic and reporting was 2 days (IQR 2-5 days) in mainland China and decreased from 9 days before Jan 18, 2020, to 2 days thereafter (Wilcoxon test p&lt;0 0001; figure 4). Similarly to delays in seeking care at a hospital or clinic, reporting was quickest in Tianjin and Yunnan (median 1 day [IQR 0-1]) and slowest in Hubei province (median 12 days [IQR 7-16]).\nThe median delay between symptom onset and seeking care at a hospital or clinic was 1 day (IQR 0-3) for international travellers, and shorter than for patients in Hubei province or the rest of mainland China (Kruskal-Wallis test p&lt;0 0001; figure 4). Even in the period after Jan 18, 2020, when awareness of the outbreak increased, a shorter delay between symptom onset and seeking care at a hospital or clinic was seen for international patients than for those in mainland China (Wilcoxon test p&lt;0 0001). For international cases, the delay between seeking care at a hospital or clinic and reporting was 2 days (IQR 1-4), also shorter than for mainland China (Wilcoxon test p&lt;0 0001; figure 4).\nOn the basis of 33 patients with a travel history to Wuhan, we estimated the median incubation period for COVID-19 to be 4 5 days (IQR 3 0-5 5; appendix p 2).\nDiscussion\nInformation from patient line lists is crucial but difficult to obtain at the beginning of an outbreak. Here we have shown that careful compilation of crowdsourced reports curated by a long-standing Chinese medical social network provides a valuable picture of the outbreak of COVID-19 in real time. The outbreak timeline is consistent with aggregated case counts provided by health authorities. For comparison, China CDC published the first epidemic curve by symptom onset on Jan 28, 2020. Line lists provide unique information on the delays between symptom onset and detection by the health-care system, reporting delays, and travel histories. This information cannot be extracted from aggregated case counts published by official sources. Line list data can help assess the effectiveness of interventions and the potential for widespread transmission beyond the initial foci of infection. In particular, shorter delays between symptom onset and admission to hospital or seeking care in a hospital or clinic accelerate detection and isolation of cases, effectively shortening the infectious period.\nA useful feature of our crowdsourced database was the availability of travel histories for patients returning from Wuhan, which, along with dates of symptom onset, allowed for estimation of the incubation period here and in related work. A narrow window of exposure could be defined for a subset of patients who had a short stay in Wuhan, at a time when the epidemic was still localised to Wuhan. Several teams have used our dataset and datasets from others to estimate a mean incubation period for COVID-19 to be 5-6 days (95% CI 2-11). Our own estimate (median 4 5 days [IQR 3 0-5 5]) is consistent with previous work that used other modelling approaches. The incubation period is a useful parameter to guide isolation and contact tracing; based on existing data, the disease status of a contact should be known with near certainty after a period of observation of 14 days. Availability of a public dataset enables independent estimation of important epidemiological parameters by several teams, allowing for confirmation and cross-checking at a time when information can be conflicting and noisy.\nAn interesting finding in our data relates to the age distribution of patients. We found a heavy skew of infection towards older age groups, with substantially fewer children infected. This pattern could indicate age-related differences in susceptibility to infection, severe outcomes, or behaviour. However, a substantial portion of the patients in our database are travellers, a population that is usually predominantly adults (although does not exclude children). Furthermore, because patient data in our dataset were captured by the health system, they are biased towards the more severe spectrum of the disease, especially for patients from mainland China. Clinical reports have shown that severity of COVID-19 is associated with the presence of chronic conditions, which are more frequent in older age groups. Nevertheless, we would also expect children younger than 5 years to be at risk of severe outcomes and to be reported to the health-care system, as is seen for other respiratory infections. \nBiological differences could have a role in shaping these age profiles. A detailed analysis of one of the early COVID-19 clusters by Chan and colleagues revealed symptomatic infections in five adult members of the same household, while a child in the same household aged 10 years was infected but remained asymptomatic, potentially indicating biological differences in the risk of clinical disease driven by age. Previous immunity from infection with a related coronavirus has been speculated to potentially protect children from SARS, and so might also have a role in COVID-19. In any case, if the age distribution of cases reported here was to be confirmed and the epidemic were to progress globally, we would expect an increase in respiratory mortality concentrated among people aged 30 years and older. This mortality pattern would be substantially different from the profile of the 2009 influenza pandemic, for which excess mortality was concentrated in those younger than 65 years. \nIn our dataset, we saw a rapid increase in the number of people infected with COVID-19 in several provinces of China, consistent with local transmission outside of Hubei province. As of Jan 31, 2020, province-level epidemic curves are only available by date of reporting, rather than date of symptom onset, which usually inflates recent case counts if detection has increased. Furthermore, province-level data include both returning travellers from Hubei province (ie, importations) and locally acquired cases, which also usually inflate the apparent risk of local transmission. Notably, other lines of evidence suggest that local transmission is now well established outside of Hubei province, because travel increased just before the Chinese New Year on Jan 25, 2020, and before implementation of the travel ban in Wuhan. Accordingly, our own data include evidence of transmission clusters in non-travellers, with, for instance, a second-generation transmission event reported in Shaanxi on Jan 21, 2020.\nOur study had several limitations, one of which was the data we used. Although all provinces in mainland China provide aggregated information on infections and deaths, individual-level patient descriptions are only available for a subset of provinces. Geographical coverage is heterogeneous in our line list, and we have a notable deficit of cases from Hubei province, the foci of the COVID-19 outbreak. We expect that little patient-level information is shared on social media by province-level and city-level health authorities in Wuhan and Hubei province because health systems are overwhelmed. For similar reasons, provinces with a large total case count at the end of January, 2020, or with a weaker health infrastructure, were under-represented in our line list, with the exception of Beijing. Other limitations in our data include severity (only patients who had severe enough symptoms to seek care were captured) and changes in case definition. A series of epidemiological criteria were required for COVID-19 testing, including travel history to Wuhan within the past 2 weeks; residence in Wuhan within the past 2 weeks; contact with individuals from Wuhan (with fever and respiratory symptoms) within the past 2 weeks; and being part of an established disease cluster. Some of these criteria (eg, relation to Wuhan) were relaxed over time (appendix). As a result, we have an over-representation of travel-related cases in our database.\nThe reproduction number is an important quantity for outbreak control. We refrained from estimating this parameter because reporting changes could bias estimates relying on epidemic growth rates. Furthermore, our dataset captured cases all over China and does not reflect transmission patterns in any particular location. A mean reproduction number of 2 5-2 7 has previously been estimated on the basis of the volume of importations of international cases in the pre-intervention period in Wuhan. \nWe recognise that, although our data source is useful and timely, it should not replace official statistics. Manual compilation of detailed line lists from media sources is highly time consuming and is not sustainable when case counts reach several thousands. Here we provide detailed data on 507 patients when the official case count was over 9000 by Jan 31, 2020, representing a sample of approximately 5% of reported cases and a much smaller proportion of the full spectrum of COVID-19 cases, which include mild infections. A crowdsourced system would not be expected to catch all cases, especially if many cases are too mild to be captured by the health-care system, digital surveillance, or social media. Notably, DXY.cn does not generate data outside of traditional surveillance systems but rather provides a channel of rapid communication between the public and health authorities. In turn, our approach has helped extract and repackage information from health authorities into an analytical format, which was not available elsewhere.\nAt the time of writing, efforts are underway to coordinate compilation of COVID-19 data from online sources across several academic teams. Ultimately, we expect that a line list of patients will be shared by government sources with the global community; however, data cleaning and access issues might take a prohibitively long time to resolve. For the west African Ebola outbreak, a similarly coordinated effort to publish a line list took 2 years. Given the progression of the COVID-19 outbreak, such a long delay would be counterproductive.\nOverall, the novelty of our approach was to rely on a unique source for social media and news reports in China, which aggregated and curated relevant information. This approach facilitated entry of robust and standard data on clinical and demographic information. Reassuringly, DXY.cn maintains a special section dedicated to debunking fake news, myths, and rumours about the COVID-19 outbreak. Looking to the future, collection of patient data in the context of emergencies could include information on whether patients are identified through contact tracing or because they seek care on their own. Furthermore, data interpretability could be improved by gathering more quantitative information on how case definitions are used in practice.\nIn conclusion, crowdsourced epidemiological data can be useful to monitor emerging outbreaks, such as COVID-19 and, as previously, Ebola virus. These efforts can help generate and disseminate detailed information in the early stages of an outbreak when little other data are available, enabling independent estimation of key parameters that affect interventions. Based on our small sample of patients with COVID-19, we note an intriguing age distribution, reminiscent of that of SARS, which warrants further epidemiological and serological studies. We also report early signs that the response is strengthening in China on the basis of a decrease in case detection time, and rapid management of travel-related infections that are identified internationally. This is an early report of a rapidly evolving situation and the parameters discussed here could change quickly. In the coming weeks, we will continue to monitor the epidemiology of this outbreak using data from news reports and official sources.\nFor an example of an online source see https://ncov.dxy.cn/ncovh5/view/pneumonia \nFor the WHO situation report as of Jan 31, 2020, see https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/situation-reports/20200131-sitrep-11-ncov.pdf?sfvrsn=de7c0f7_4 \nFor the Laboratory for the Modeling of Biological + Socio-technical systems website at Northeastern University see https://www.mobs-lab.org/2019ncov.html \nFor the spreadsheet of patient-level data until Jan 31, 2020, see https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Gb5cyg0fjUtsqh3hl_L-C5A23zIOXmWH5veBklfSHzg/edit?usp=sharing \nFor DXY website see DXY.cn \nData sharing\nAll data used in this report have been made publicly available on the Laboratory for the Modeling of Biological + Socio-technical systems website of Northeastern University.

(The median age of the H3N2 patients is 23 years while H1N1 patients are 9 years old.\n) These distinct characteristic spectra of age groups, possibly carried over from previous pandemics, are consistent with previous reports from various regional population studies and also findings on the evolutionary dynamics of each subtype.\n Moreover, they are relevant to age-related risk assessments, modeling of epidemiological networks for specific age groups, and age-specific vaccine design.\n Recently, a novel H1N1 virus has spread around the world.\n Preliminary reports suggest that this new strain causes symptomatic disease in the younger population in a similar fashion to the seasonal H1N1 strains.\n","id":"PMC2729409","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Public Library of Science","authors":[{"firstname":"Hossein","surname":"Khiabanian","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Gregory M.","surname":"Farrell","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Kirsten","surname":"St. George","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Raul","surname":"Rabadan","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Geneviève","surname":"Chêne","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Geneviève","surname":"Chêne","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Tecumseh study of illness.

Taiwan","abstract":"Background\nThe 2002-2003 Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak infected 8,422 individuals leading to 916 deaths around the world.\n\n However, there have been few epidemiological studies of SARS comparing epidemiologic features across regions.\n\n The aim of this study is to identify similarities and differences in SARS epidemiology in three populations with similar host and viral genotype.\n\n\nMethods\nWe present a comparative epidemiologic analysis of SARS, based on an integrated dataset with 3,336 SARS patients from Hong Kong, Beijing and Taiwan, epidemiological and clinical characteristics such as incubation, onset-to-admission, onset-to-discharge and onset-to-death periods, case fatality ratios (CFRs) and presenting symptoms are described and compared between regions.\n\n We further explored the influence of demographic and clinical variables on the apparently large differences in CFRs between the three regions.\n\n\nResults\nAll three regions showed similar incubation periods and progressive shortening of the onset-to-admission interval through the epidemic.\n\n Adjusted for sex, health care worker status and nosocomial setting, older age was associated with a higher fatality, with adjusted odds ratio (AOR): 2.10 (95% confidence interval: 1.45, 3.04) for those aged 51-60; AOR: 4.57 (95% confidence interval: 3.32, 7.30) for those aged above 60 compared to those aged 41-50 years.\n\n Presence of pre-existing comorbid conditions was also associated with greater mortality (AOR: 1.74; 95% confidence interval: 1.36, 2.21).\n\n\nConclusion\nThe large discrepancy in crude fatality ratios across the three regions can only be partly explained by epidemiological and clinical heterogeneities.\n\n Our findings underline the importance of a common data collection platform, especially in an emerging epidemic, in order to identify and explain consistencies and differences in the eventual clinical and public health outcomes of infectious disease outbreaks, which is becoming increasingly important in our highly interconnected world.\n\n\n","id":"PMC2846944","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"BioMed

coronavirus (MERS-CoV) had, as of Aug 8, 2013, caused 111 virologically confirmed or probable human cases of infection worldwide.\n\n We analysed epidemiological and genetic data to assess the extent of human infection, the performance of case detection, and the transmission potential of MERS-CoV with and without control measures.\n\n\nMethods\nWe assembled a comprehensive database of all confirmed and probable cases from public sources and estimated the incubation period and generation time from case cluster data.\n\n Using data of numbers of visitors to the Middle East and their duration of stay, we estimated the number of symptomatic cases in the Middle East.\n\n We did independent analyses, looking at the growth in incident clusters, the growth in viral population, the reproduction number of cluster index cases, and cluster sizes to characterise the dynamical properties of the epidemic and the transmission scenario.\n\n\nFindings\nThe estimated number of symptomatic cases up to Aug 8, 2013, is 940 (95% CI 2902200), indicating that at least 62% of human symptomatic cases have not been detected.\n\n We find that the case-fatality ratio of primary cases detected via routine surveillance (74%; 95% CI 4991) is biased upwards because of detection bias; the case-fatality ratio of secondary cases was 20% (742).\n\n Detection of milder cases (or clinical management) seemed to have improved in recent months.\n\n Analysis of human clusters indicated that chains of transmission were not self-sustaining when infection control was implemented, but that R in the absence of controls was in the range 0·81·3. Three independent data sources provide evidence that R cannot be much above 1, with an upper bound of 1·21·5.\nInterpretation\nBy showing that a slowly growing epidemic is underway either in human beings or in an animal reservoir, quantification of uncertainty in transmissibility estimates, and provision of the first estimates of the scale of the epidemic and extent of case detection biases, we provide valuable information for more informed risk assessment.\n\n\nFunding\nMedical Research Council, Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation, EU FP7, and National Institute of General Medical Sciences.\n\n\n","id":"PMC3895322","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Cauchemez et al.

Of six family members who travelled to Wuhan, five were identified as infected with the novel coronavirus.\n\n Additionally, one family member, who did not travel to Wuhan, became infected with the virus after several days of contact with four of the family members.\n\n None of the family members had contacts with Wuhan markets or animals, although two had visited a Wuhan hospital.\n\n Five family members (aged 3666 years) presented with fever, upper or lower respiratory tract symptoms, or diarrhoea, or a combination of these 36 days after exposure.\n\n They presented to our hospital (The University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen) 610 days after symptom onset.\n\n They and one asymptomatic child (aged 10 years) had radiological ground-glass lung opacities.\n\n Older patients (aged &gt;60 years) had more systemic symptoms, extensive radiological ground-glass lung changes, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and increased C-reactive protein and lactate dehydrogenase levels.\n\n The nasopharyngeal or throat swabs of these six patients were negative for known respiratory microbes by point-of-care multiplex RT-PCR, but five patients (four adults and the child) were RT-PCR positive for genes encoding the internal RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and surface Spike protein of this novel coronavirus, which were confirmed by Sanger sequencing.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these five patients' RT-PCR amplicons and two full genomes by next-generation sequencing showed that this is a novel coronavirus, which is closest to the bat severe acute respiatory syndrome

outcomes in patients with a number of different malignancies.\n\n The objective of this study was to assess the relationship between NLR and mortality in a population of adult critically ill patients.\n\n\nMethods\nWe performed an observational cohort study of unselected intensive care unit (ICU) patients based on records in a large clinical database.\n\n We computed individual patient NLR and categorized patients by quartile of this ratio.\n\n The association of NLR quartiles and 28-day mortality was assessed using multivariable logistic regression.\n\n Secondary outcomes included mortality in the ICU, in-hospital mortality and 1-year mortality.\n\n An a priori subgroup analysis of patients with versus without sepsis was performed to assess any differences in the relationship between the NLR and outcomes in these cohorts.\n\n\nResults\nA total of 5,056 patients were included.\n\n Their 28-day mortality rate was 19%.\n\n The median age of the cohort was 65 years, and 47% were female.\n\n The median NLR for the entire cohort was 8.9 (interquartile range, 4.99 to 16.21).\n\n Following multivariable adjustments, there was a stepwise increase in mortality with increasing quartiles of NLR (first quartile: reference category; second quartile odds ratio (OR) = 1.32; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.03 to 1.71; third quartile OR = 1.43; 95% CI, 1.12 to 1.83; 4th quartile OR = 1.71; 95% CI, 1.35 to 2.16).\n\n A similar stepwise relationship was identified in the subgroup of patients who presented without sepsis.\n\n The NLR was not associated with 28-day mortality in

ill patients.\n\n In patients with sepsis, there was no statistically significant relationship between NLR and mortality.\n\n Further investigation is required to increase understanding of the pathophysiology of this relationship and to validate these findings with data collected prospectively.\n\n\nElectronic supplementary material\nThe online version of this article

new coronavirus associated with human respiratory disease in China","abstract":"id='Par1'>Emerging infectious diseases, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Zika virus disease, present a major threat to public health13.\n Despite intense research efforts, how, when and where new diseases appear are still a source of considerable uncertainty.\n A severe respiratory disease was recently reported in Wuhan, Hubei province, China.\n As of 25 January 2020, at least 1,975 cases had been reported since the first patient was hospitalized on 12 December 2019. Epidemiological investigations have suggested that the outbreak was associated with a seafood market in Wuhan.\n Here we study a single patient who was a worker at the market and who was admitted to the Central Hospital of Wuhan on 26 December 2019 while experiencing a severe respiratory syndrome that included fever, dizziness and a cough.\n Metagenomic RNA sequencing4 of a sample of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from the patient identified a new RNA virus strain from the family Coronaviridae, which is designated here WH-Human 1 coronavirus (and has also been referred to as 2019-nCoV).\n Phylogenetic analysis of the complete viral genome (29,903 nucleotides) revealed that the virus was most closely related (89.1% nucleotide similarity) to a group of SARS-like coronaviruses (genus Betacoronavirus, subgenus Sarbecovirus) that had previously been found in bats in China5.\n This outbreak highlights the ongoing ability of viral spill-over from animals to cause severe disease in humans.\n","id":"PMC7094943","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Nature Publishing Group

of a family cluster","abstract":"Background\nAn ongoing outbreak of pneumonia associated with a novel coronavirus was reported in Wuhan city, Hubei province, China.\n\n Affected patients were geographically linked with a local wet market as a potential source.\n\n No data on person-to-person or nosocomial transmission have been published to date.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this study, we report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, radiological, and microbiological findings of five patients in a family cluster who presented with unexplained pneumonia after returning to Shenzhen, Guangdong province, China, after a visit to Wuhan, and an additional family member who did not travel to Wuhan.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of genetic sequences from these patients were done.\n\n\nFindings\nFrom Jan 10, 2020, we enrolled a family of six patients who travelled to Wuhan from Shenzhen between Dec 29, 2019 and Jan 4, 2020. Of six family members who travelled to Wuhan, five were identified as infected with the novel coronavirus.\n\n Additionally, one family member, who did not travel to Wuhan, became infected with the virus after several days of contact with four of the family members.\n\n None of the family members had contacts with Wuhan markets or animals, although two had visited a Wuhan hospital.\n\n Five family members (aged 3666 years) presented with fever, upper or lower respiratory tract symptoms, or diarrhoea, or a combination of these 36 days after exposure.\n\n They presented to our hospital (The University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen) 610 days after symptom onset.\n\n They and one asymptomatic child (aged 10 years) had radiological ground-glass lung opacities.\n\n Older patients (aged &gt;60 years) had more systemic symptoms, extensive radiological ground-glass lung changes, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and increased C-reactive protein and lactate dehydrogenase levels.\n\n The nasopharyngeal or throat swabs of these six patients were negative for known respiratory microbes by point-of-care multiplex RT-PCR, but five patients (four adults and the child) were RT-PCR positive for genes encoding the internal RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and surface Spike protein of this novel coronavirus, which were confirmed by Sanger sequencing.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these five patients' RT-PCR amplicons and two full genomes by next-generation sequencing showed that this is a novel coronavirus, which is closest to the bat severe acute respiatory syndrome (SARS)-related coronaviruses found in Chinese horseshoe bats.\n\n\nInterpretation\nOur findings are consistent with person-to-person transmission of this novel coronavirus in hospital and family settings, and the reports of infected travellers in other geographical regions.\n\n\nFunding\nThe Shaw Foundation Hong Kong, Michael Seak-Kan Tong, Respiratory Viral Research Foundation Limited, Hui

We analyzed data on the first 425 confirmed cases in Wuhan to determine the epidemiologic characteristics of NCIP.\n\n\nMethods\nWe collected information on demographic characteristics, exposure history, and illness timelines of laboratory-confirmed cases of NCIP that had been reported by January 22, 2020.

Of six family members who travelled to Wuhan, five were identified as infected with the novel coronavirus.\n\n Additionally, one family member, who did not travel to Wuhan, became infected with the virus after several days of contact with four of the family members.\n\n None of the family members had contacts with Wuhan markets or animals, although two had visited a Wuhan hospital.\n\n Five family members (aged 3666 years) presented with fever, upper or lower respiratory tract symptoms, or diarrhoea, or a combination of these 36 days after exposure.\n\n They presented to our hospital (The University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen) 610 days after symptom onset.\n\n They and one asymptomatic child (aged 10 years) had radiological ground-glass lung opacities.\n\n Older patients (aged &gt;60 years) had more systemic symptoms, extensive radiological ground-glass lung changes, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and increased C-reactive protein and lactate dehydrogenase levels.\n\n The nasopharyngeal or throat swabs of these six patients were negative for known respiratory microbes by point-of-care multiplex RT-PCR, but five patients (four adults and the child) were RT-PCR positive for genes encoding the internal RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and surface Spike protein of this novel coronavirus, which were confirmed by Sanger sequencing.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these five patients' RT-PCR amplicons and two full genomes by next-generation sequencing showed that this is a novel coronavirus, which is closest to the bat severe acute respiatory syndrome (SARS)-related coronaviruses found in Chinese horseshoe bats.\n\n\nInterpretation\nOur findings are consistent with person-to-person transmission of this novel coronavirus in hospital and family settings, and the reports of infected travellers in other geographical regions.\n\n\nFunding\nThe Shaw Foundation Hong Kong, Michael Seak-Kan Tong, Respiratory Viral Research Foundation Limited, Hui

records, hospital statistics, and our own observations during response activities.\n\n We used Fisher's exact tests for differences in proportions, t-tests for differences in means, and logistic regression for multivariable analysis.\n\n\nResults\nThe response to the outbreak consisted of surveillance, case management, logistics and public mobilisation.\n\n Twenty-six EHF cases (24 laboratory confirmed, two probable) occurred between October 21st and December 22nd, 2000. CFP was 69% (18/26).\n\n Nosocomial transmission to the index case occurred in Lacor hospital in Gulu, outside the Ebola ward.\n\n After returning home to Masindi district the index case became the origin of a transmission chain within her own extended family (18 further cases), from index family members to health care workers (HCWs, 6 cases), and from HCWs to their household contacts (1 case).\n\n Five out of six occupational cases of EHF in HCWs occurred after the introduction of barrier nursing, probably due to breaches of barrier nursing principles.\n\n CFP was initially very high (76%) but decreased (20%) due to better case management after reinforcing the response team.\n\n The mobilisation of the community for the response efforts was challenging at the beginning, when fear, panic and mistrust had to be countered by the response team.\n\n\nConclusions\nLarge scale transmission in the community beyond the index family was prevented by early case identification and isolation as well as quarantine imposed by the community.\n\n The high number of occupational EHF after implementing barrier nursing points at the need to strengthen training and supervision of local HCWs.\n\n The difference in CFP before and after reinforcing the response team together with observations on the ward suggest a critical role for intensive supportive treatment.\n\n Collecting high quality clinical data is a priority for future outbreaks in order to identify the best possible FHF treatment regime under field conditions.\n\n\n","id":"PMC3276451","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"BioMed Central","authors":[{"firstname":"Matthias","surname":"Borchert","email":"matthias.borchert@charite.de","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Imaam","surname":"Mutyaba","email":"immutyaba2003@yahoo.co.uk","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Maria D","surname":"Van Kerkhove","email":"m.vankerkhove@imperial.ac.uk","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Julius","surname":"Lutwama","email":"jjlutwama03@yahoo.com","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Henry","surname":"Luwaga","email":"hluwaga@yahoo.co.uk","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Geoffrey","surname":"Bisoborwa","email":"bisoborwag@ug.afro.who.int","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"John","surname":"Turyagaruka","email":"turyagaruka@yahoo.com","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Patricia","surname":"Pirard","email":"patriciapirard@hotmail.com","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Nestor","surname":"Ndayimirije","email":"ndayimirijen@lr.afro.who.int","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Paul","surname":"Roddy","email":"paul.roddy@barcelona.msf.org","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Patrick","surname":"Van Der Stuyft","email":"pvdstuyft@itg.be","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Ebola haemorrhagic fever in Zaire, 1976","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Report of a WHO/International Study Team","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1371/journal.pntd.0003652","date":"1970-01-01","title":"What Factors Might Have Led to the Emergence of Ebola in West Africa?","abstract":"An Ebola outbreak of unprecedented scope emerged in West Africa in December 2013 and presently continues unabated in the countries of Guinea, Sierra Leone, and Liberia.\n Ebola is not new to Africa, and outbreaks have been confirmed as far back as 1976. The current West African Ebola outbreak is the largest ever recorded and differs dramatically from prior outbreaks in its duration, number of people affected, and geographic extent.\n The emergence of this deadly disease in West Africa invites many questions, foremost among these: why now, and why in West Africa? Here, we review the sociological, ecological, and environmental drivers that might have influenced the emergence of Ebola in this region of Africa and its spread throughout the region.\n Containment of the West African Ebola outbreak is the most pressing, immediate need.\n A comprehensive assessment of the drivers of Ebola emergence and sustained human-to-human transmission is also needed in order to prepare other countries for importation or emergence of this disease.\n Such assessment includes identification of country-level protocols and interagency policies for outbreak detection and rapid response, increased understanding of cultural and traditional risk factors within and between nations, delivery of culturally embedded public health education, and regional coordination and collaboration, particularly with governments and health ministries throughout Africa.\n Public health education is also urgently needed in countries outside of Africa in order to ensure that risk is properly understood and public concerns do not escalate unnecessarily.\n To prevent future outbreaks, coordinated, multiscale, early warning systems should be developed that make full use of these integrated assessments, partner with local communities in high-risk areas, and provide clearly defined response recommendations specific to the needs of each community.\n","id":"PMC4456362","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Public Library of Science","authors":[{"firstname":"Kathleen A.","surname":"Alexander","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Claire E.","surname":"Sanderson","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Madav","surname":"Marathe","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Bryan L.","surname":"Lewis","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Caitlin M.","surname":"Rivers","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Jeffrey","surname":"Shaman","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"John M.","surname":"Drake","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Eric","surname":"Lofgren","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Virginia M.","surname":"Dato","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Marisa C.","surname":"Eisenberg","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Stephen","surname":"Eubank","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Oladele B.","surname":"Akogun","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Oladele B.","surname":"Akogun","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1056/NEJMp1409859","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Ebola virus disease in West Africa:no early end to the outbreak","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1056/NEJMoa1411100","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Ebola virus disease in West Africa:the first 9 months of the epidemic and forward projections","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1056/NEJMc1414992","date":"1970-01-01","title":"West African Ebola epidemic after one year:slowing but not yet under control","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1056/NEJMc1415318","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Ebola virus disease among children in West Africa","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Ebola virus disease among male and female persons in West Africa","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"National Institute of Standards and Technology.

9.3 days (±0.3 days).\n The model was able to disentangle the impact of the two SSEs from background transmission rates.\n The effective contact rates, which were estimated on a daily basis, decreased with time, reaching zero inside hospitals.\n This observation suggests that public health measures and possible changes in individual behaviors effectively reduced transmission, especially in hospitals.\n The temporal patterns of reproduction numbers were similar for healthcare workers and the general population, indicating that on average, an infectious healthcare worker did not infect

many pathogens in several species, and individuals who infect disproportionately more secondary contacts, as compared to most others, became known as super-spreaders.\n Studies conducted in the wake of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) pandemic revealed that, in the absence of super-spreading events, most individuals infect few, if any, secondary contacts.\n The analysis of SARS transmission, and reports from other outbreaks, unveil a complex scenario in which super-spreading events are shaped by multiple factors, including co-infection with another pathogen, immune suppression, changes in airflow dynamics, delayed hospital admission, misdiagnosis, and inter-hospital transfers.\n Predicting and identifying super-spreaders open significant medical and public

etc.\n) depends on the underlying host contact network.\n Human contact networks exhibit strong community structure.\n Understanding how such community structure affects epidemics may provide insights for preventing the spread of disease between communities by changing the structure of the contact network through pharmaceutical or non-pharmaceutical interventions.\n We use empirical and simulated networks to investigate the spread of disease in networks with community structure.\n We find that community structure has a major impact on disease dynamics, and we show that in networks with strong community structure, immunization interventions targeted at individuals bridging communities are more effective than those simply targeting highly connected individuals.\n Because the structure of relevant contact networks is generally not known, and vaccine supply is often limited, there is great need for efficient vaccination algorithms that do not require full knowledge of the network.\n We developed an algorithm that acts only on locally available network information and is able to quickly identify targets for successful immunization intervention.\n The algorithm generally outperforms existing algorithms when vaccine supply is limited, particularly in networks with strong community structure.\n Understanding the spread of infectious diseases and designing optimal control strategies is a major goal of public health.\n Social networks show marked patterns of community structure, and our results, based on empirical and simulated data, demonstrate that community structure strongly affects disease dynamics.\n These results have implications for the design of control strategies.\n","id":"PMC2851561","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Public Library of

biochemical indexes from 2019-nCoV infected patients linked to viral loads and lung injury\nThe outbreak of the 2019-nCoV infection began in December 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei province, and rapidly spread to many provinces in China as well as other countries. Here we report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics, as well as potential biomarkers for predicting disease severity in 2019-nCoV-infected patients in Shenzhen, China. All 12 cases of the 2019-nCoV-infected patients developed pneumonia and half of them developed acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The most common laboratory abnormalities were hypoalbuminemia, lymphopenia, decreased percentage of lymphocytes (LYM) and neutrophils (NEU), elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and decreased CD8 count. The viral load of 2019-nCoV detected from patient respiratory tracts was positively linked to lung disease severity. ALB, LYM, LYM (%), LDH, NEU (%), and CRP were highly correlated to the acute lung injury. Age, viral load, lung injury score, and blood biochemistry indexes, albumin (ALB), CRP, LDH, LYM (%), LYM, and NEU (%), may be predictors of disease severity. Moreover, the Angiotensin II level in the plasma sample from 2019-nCoV infected patients was markedly elevated and linearly associated to viral load and lung injury. Our results suggest a number of potential diagnosis biomarkers and angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) drugs for potential repurposing treatment of 2019-nCoV infection.\nElectronic Supplementary

city, Hubei province, China.\n\n Affected patients were geographically linked with a local wet market as a potential source.\n\n No data on person-to-person or nosocomial transmission have been published to date.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this study, we report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, radiological, and microbiological findings of five patients in a family cluster who presented with unexplained pneumonia after returning to Shenzhen, Guangdong province, China, after a visit to Wuhan, and an additional family member who did not travel to Wuhan.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of genetic sequences from these patients were done.\n\n\nFindings\nFrom Jan 10, 2020, we enrolled a family of six patients who travelled to Wuhan from Shenzhen between Dec 29, 2019 and Jan 4, 2020. Of six family members who travelled to Wuhan, five were identified as infected with the novel coronavirus.\n\n Additionally, one family member, who did not travel to Wuhan, became infected with the virus after several days of contact with four of the family members.\n\n None of the family members had contacts with Wuhan markets or animals, although two had visited a Wuhan hospital.\n\n Five family members (aged 3666 years) presented with fever, upper or lower respiratory tract symptoms, or diarrhoea, or a combination of these 36 days after exposure.\n\n They presented to our hospital (The University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen) 610 days after symptom onset.\n\n They and one asymptomatic child (aged 10 years) had radiological ground-glass lung opacities.\n\n Older patients (aged &gt;60 years) had more systemic symptoms, extensive radiological ground-glass lung changes, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and increased C-reactive protein and lactate dehydrogenase levels.\n\n The nasopharyngeal or throat swabs of these six patients were negative for known respiratory microbes by point-of-care multiplex RT-PCR, but five patients (four adults and the child) were RT-PCR positive for genes encoding the internal RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and surface Spike protein of this novel coronavirus, which were confirmed by Sanger sequencing.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these five patients' RT-PCR amplicons and two full genomes by next-generation sequencing showed that this is a novel coronavirus, which is closest to the bat severe acute respiatory syndrome (SARS)-related coronaviruses found in Chinese horseshoe bats.\n\n\nInterpretation\nOur findings are consistent with person-to-person transmission of this novel coronavirus in hospital and family settings, and the reports of infected travellers in other geographical regions.\n\n\nFunding\nThe Shaw Foundation Hong Kong, Michael Seak-Kan Tong, Respiratory Viral Research Foundation Limited, Hui

CoronavirusInfected Pneumonia","abstract":"Background\nThe initial cases of novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV)infected pneumonia (NCIP) occurred in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, in December 2019 and January 2020. We analyzed data on the first 425 confirmed cases in Wuhan to determine the epidemiologic characteristics of NCIP.\n\n\nMethods\nWe collected information on demographic characteristics, exposure history, and illness timelines of laboratory-confirmed cases of NCIP that had been reported by January 22, 2020. We described characteristics of the cases and estimated the key epidemiologic time-delay distributions.\n\n In the early period of exponential growth, we estimated the epidemic doubling time and the basic reproductive number.\n\n\nResults\nAmong the first 425 patients with confirmed NCIP, the median age was 59 years and 56% were male.\n\n The majority of cases (55%) with onset before January 1, 2020, were linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, as compared with 8.6% of the subsequent cases.\n\n The mean incubation period was 5.2 days (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.1 to 7.0), with the 95th percentile of the distribution at 12.5 days.\n\n In its early stages, the epidemic doubled in size every 7.4 days.\n\n With a mean serial interval of 7.5 days (95% CI, 5.3 to 19), the basic reproductive number was estimated to be 2.2 (95% CI, 1.4 to 3.9).\n\n\nConclusions\nOn the basis of this information, there is evidence that human-to-human transmission has occurred among close contacts since the middle of December 2019. Considerable efforts to reduce transmission will be required to control outbreaks if similar dynamics apply elsewhere.\n\n Measures to prevent or reduce transmission should be implemented in populations at risk.\n\n (Funded by the Ministry of Science and Technology of China and others.\n\n)\n","id":"PMC7121484","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Massachusetts Medical

mortality in critical illness: an observational cohort study","abstract":"Introduction\nThe neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) is a biological marker that has been shown to be associated with outcomes in patients with a number of different malignancies.\n\n The objective of this study was to assess the relationship between NLR and mortality in a population of adult critically ill patients.\n\n\nMethods\nWe performed an observational cohort study of unselected intensive care unit (ICU) patients based on records in a large clinical database.\n\n We computed individual patient NLR and categorized patients by quartile of this ratio.\n\n The association of NLR quartiles and 28-day mortality was assessed using multivariable logistic regression.\n\n Secondary outcomes included mortality in the ICU, in-hospital mortality and 1-year mortality.\n\n An a priori subgroup analysis of patients with versus without sepsis was performed to assess any differences in the relationship between the NLR and outcomes in these cohorts.\n\n\nResults\nA total of 5,056 patients were included.\n\n Their 28-day mortality rate was 19%.\n\n The median age of the cohort was 65 years, and 47% were female.\n\n The median NLR for the entire cohort was 8.9 (interquartile range, 4.99 to 16.21).\n\n Following multivariable adjustments, there was a stepwise increase in mortality with increasing quartiles of NLR (first quartile: reference category; second quartile odds ratio (OR) = 1.32; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.03 to 1.71; third quartile OR = 1.43; 95% CI, 1.12 to 1.83; 4th quartile OR = 1.71; 95% CI, 1.35 to 2.16).\n\n A similar stepwise relationship was identified in the subgroup of patients who presented without sepsis.\n\n The NLR was not associated with 28-day mortality in patients with sepsis.\n\n Increasing quartile of NLR was statistically significantly associated with secondary outcome.\n\n\nConclusion\nThe NLR is associated with outcomes in unselected critically ill patients.\n\n In patients with sepsis, there was no statistically significant relationship between NLR and mortality.\n\n Further investigation is required to increase understanding of the pathophysiology of this relationship and to validate these findings with data collected prospectively.\n\n\nElectronic supplementary material\nThe online version of this article

a major threat to public health13.\n Despite intense research efforts, how, when and where new diseases appear are still a source of considerable uncertainty.\n A severe respiratory disease was recently reported in Wuhan, Hubei province, China.\n As of 25 January 2020, at least 1,975 cases had been reported since the first patient was hospitalized on 12 December 2019. Epidemiological investigations have suggested that the outbreak was associated with a seafood market in Wuhan.\n Here we study a single patient who was a worker at the market and who was admitted to the Central Hospital of Wuhan on 26 December 2019 while experiencing a severe respiratory syndrome that included fever, dizziness and a cough.\n Metagenomic RNA sequencing4 of a sample of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from the patient identified a new RNA virus strain from the family Coronaviridae, which is designated here WH-Human 1 coronavirus (and has also been referred to as 2019-nCoV).\n Phylogenetic analysis of the complete viral genome (29,903 nucleotides) revealed that the virus was most closely related (89.1% nucleotide similarity) to a group of SARS-like coronaviruses (genus Betacoronavirus, subgenus Sarbecovirus) that had previously been found in bats in China5.\n This outbreak highlights the ongoing ability of viral spill-over from animals to cause severe disease in humans.\n","id":"PMC7094943","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Nature Publishing Group

A first step in understanding SARS pathogenesis","abstract":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is an acute infectious disease that spreads mainly via the respiratory route.\n A distinct coronavirus (SARS?CoV) has been identified as the aetiological agent of SARS.\n Recently, a metallopeptidase named angiotensin?converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) has been identified as the functional receptor for SARS?CoV.\n Although ACE2 mRNA is known to be present in virtually all organs, its protein expression is largely unknown.\n Since identifying the possible route of infection has major implications for understanding the pathogenesis and future treatment strategies for SARS, the present study investigated the localization of ACE2 protein in various human organs (oral and nasal mucosa, nasopharynx, lung, stomach, small intestine, colon, skin, lymph nodes, thymus, bone marrow, spleen, liver, kidney, and brain).\n The most remarkable finding was the surface expression of ACE2 protein on lung alveolar epithelial cells and enterocytes of the small intestine.\n Furthermore, ACE2 was present in arterial and venous endothelial cells and arterial smooth muscle cells in all organs studied.\n In conclusion, ACE2 is abundantly present in humans in the epithelia of the lung and small intestine, which might provide possible routes of entry for the SARS?CoV.\n This epithelial expression, together with the presence of ACE2 in vascular endothelium, also provides a first step in understanding the pathogenesis of the main SARS disease manifestations.\n Copyright © 2004 Pathological Society of Great Britain and Ireland.\n Published by John Wiley &amp;

The standardized incidence rate corrected for the Korean general population was 1,550; this value was higher in men and increased with increasing age.\n\n Risk factors for incident COPD were age ?60 years (adjusted RR [aRR] =2.52 vs age &lt;60 years), male sex (aRR =2.02 vs female), heavy smoking (?20 pack-years; aRR =2.54 vs never smoker), and lowest income group (first quartile; aRR =2.03 vs

systematic review and meta-analysis","abstract":"Background\nCalcium channel blocker (CCB) or two renin angiotensin aldosterone system blockades (RAAS), angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), are major potent and prevalently used as initial antihypertensive agents for mild to moderate hypertension, but no uniform agreement as to which antihypertensive drugs should be given for initial therapy, especially among chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients.\n\n\nDesign\nA systematic review and meta-analysis comparing CCBs and the two RAAS blockades for hypertensive patients with CKD stage 3 to 5D.\n\n The inclusion criteria for this systematic review was RCT that compared the effects of CCBs and the two RAAS blockades in patients with hypertension and CKD.\n\n The exclusion criteria were (1) renal transplantation, (2) CKD stage 1 or 2, (3) combined therapy (data cannot be extracted separately).\n\n Outcomes were blood pressure change, mortality, heart failure, stroke or cerebrovascular events, and renal outcomes.\n\n\nResults\n21 randomized controlled trials randomized 9,492 patients with hypertensive and CKD into CCBs and the two RAAS blockades treatments.\n\n The evidence showed no significant differences in blood presser change, mortality, heart failure, stroke or cerebrovascular events, and renal outcomes between CCBs group and the two RAAS blockades group.\n\n The publication bias of pooled mean blood presser change that was detected by Eggers test was non-significant.\n\n\nConclusions\nCCBs has similar

genomic surveillance elucidates the origins, transmission and evolution of emerging viral agents in China","abstract":"In the past twenty years, numerous novel zoonotic viral agents with pandemic potential have emerged in China, such as the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus and, more recently, the avian-origin influenza A/H7N9 virus, which have caused outbreaks among humans with high morbidity and mortality.\n In addition, several emerging and re-emerging viral pathogens have also been imported into China from travelers, e.\ng.\n the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus and Zika virus (ZIKV).\n Herein, we review these emerging viral pathogens in China and focus on how surveillance by pathogen genomics has been employed to discover and annotate novel pathogenic agents, identify natural reservoirs, monitor the transmission events and delineate their evolution and adaption to the human host.\n We also highlight the application of genomic sequencing in the recent Ebola epidemics in Western Africa.\n In summary, genomic sequencing has become a standard research tool in the field of emerging infectious diseases which has been proven invaluable in containing these viral infections and reducing burden of disease in humans and animals.\n Genomic surveillance of pathogenic agents will serve as a key epidemiological and research tool in the modern era of precision infectious diseases and in the future studies of virosphere.\n","id":"PMC7088571","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Science China

emergence of a novel human coronavirus, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), which causes a severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-like disease.\n\n In response, the development of effective vaccines and therapeutics remains a clinical priority.\n\n To accomplish this, it is necessary to evaluate neutralizing antibodies and screen for MERS-CoV entry inhibitors.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this study, we produced a pseudovirus bearing the full-length spike (S) protein of MERS-CoV in the Env-defective, luciferase-expressing HIV-1 backbone.\n\n We then established a pseudovirus-based inhibition assay to detect neutralizing antibodies and anti-MERS-CoV entry inhibitors.\n\n\nResults\nOur results demonstrated that the generated MERS-CoV pseudovirus allows for single-cycle infection of a variety of cells expressing dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP4), the confirmed receptor for MERS-CoV.\n\n Consistent with the results from a live MERS-CoV-based inhibition assay, the antisera of mice vaccinated with a recombinant protein containing receptor-binding domain (RBD, residues 377662) of MERS-CoV S fused with Fc of human IgG exhibited neutralizing antibody response against infection of MERS-CoV pseudovirus.\n\n Furthermore, one small molecule HIV entry inhibitor targeting gp41 (ADS-J1) and the 3-hydroxyphthalic anhydride-modified human serum albumin (HP-HSA) could significantly inhibit MERS-CoV pseudovirus infection.\n\n\nConclusion\nTaken together, the established MERS-CoV inhibition assay is a safe and convenient pseudovirus-based alternative to BSL-3 live-virus restrictions and can be used to rapidly screen MERS-CoV entry inhibitors, as well as evaluate vaccine-induced neutralizing antibodies against the highly pathogenic MERS-CoV.\n\n\n","id":"PMC3765664","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"BioMed

directly from PCR-confirmed clinical samples.\n\n Viral genomes were obtained from 21 MERS cases of which 13 had 100%, four 8595%, and four 3050% genome coverage.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of the 21 sequences, combined with nine published MERS-CoV genomes, was done.\n\n\nFindings\nThree distinct MERS-CoV genotypes were identified in Riyadh.\n\n Phylogeographic analyses suggest the MERS-CoV zoonotic reservoir is geographically disperse.\n\n Selection analysis of the MERS-CoV genomes reveals the expected accumulation of genetic diversity including changes in the S protein.\n\n The genetic diversity in the Al-Hasa cluster suggests that the hospital outbreak might have had more than one virus introduction.\n\n\nInterpretation\nWe present the largest number of MERS-CoV genomes (21) described so far.\n\n MERS-CoV full genome sequences provide greater detail in tracking transmission.\n\n Multiple introductions of MERS-CoV are identified and suggest lower R0 values.\n\n Transmission within Saudi Arabia is consistent with either movement of an animal reservoir, animal products, or movement of infected people.\n\n Further definition of the exposures responsible for the sporadic introductions of MERS-CoV into human populations is urgently needed.\n\n\nFunding\nSaudi Arabian Ministry of Health, Wellcome Trust, European Community, and National Institute of Health

Importantly, strains with high genetic similarity to SARS-CoV in the hypervariable N-terminal domain (NTD) and receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the S1 gene, the ORF3 and ORF8 region, respectively, were all discovered in this cave.\n In addition, we report the first discovery of bat SARSr-CoVs highly similar to human SARS-CoV in ORF3b and in the split ORF8a and 8b.\n Moreover, SARSr-CoV strains from this cave were more closely related to SARS-CoV in the non-structural protein genes ORF1a and 1b compared with those detected elsewhere.\n Recombination analysis shows evidence of frequent recombination events within the S gene and around the ORF8 between these SARSr-CoVs.\n We hypothesize that the direct progenitor of SARS-CoV may have originated after sequential recombination events between the precursors of these SARSr-CoVs.\n Cell entry studies demonstrated that three newly identified SARSr-CoVs with different S protein sequences are all able to use human ACE2 as the receptor, further exhibiting the close relationship between strains in this cave and SARS-CoV.\n This work provides new insights into the origin and evolution of SARS-CoV and highlights the necessity of preparedness for future emergence of SARS-like diseases.\n","id":"PMC5708621","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Public Library of Science","authors":[{"firstname":"Ben","surname":"Hu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lei-Ping","surname":"Zeng","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xing-Lou","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xing-Yi","surname":"Ge","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Wei","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Bei","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jia-Zheng","surname":"Xie","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xu-Rui","surname":"Shen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yun-Zhi","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ning","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Dong-Sheng","surname":"Luo","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xiao-Shuang","surname":"Zheng","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Mei-Niang","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Peter","surname":"Daszak","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lin-Fa","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lin-Fa","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jie","surname":"Cui","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zheng-Li","surname":"Shi","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zheng-Li","surname":"Shi","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Christian","surname":"Drosten","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Christian","surname":"Drosten","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Christian","surname":"Drosten","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"NULL","surname":"NULL","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"NULL","surname":"NULL","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"NULL","surname":"NULL","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"NULL","surname":"NULL","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"NULL","surname":"NULL","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"NULL","surname":"NULL","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"NULL","surname":"NULL","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"NULL","surname":"NULL","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1128/JVI.06882-11","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Evidence for a common evolutionary origin of coronavirus spike protein receptor-binding subunits","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1126/science.1116480","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Structure of SARS coronavirus spike receptor-binding domain complexed with receptor","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1021/acs.jctc.5b00255","date":"1970-01-01","title":"ff14SB: improving the accuracy of protein side chain and backbone parameters from ff99SB","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1038/nature12005","date":"2013-02-13","title":"Dipeptidyl peptidase 4 is a functional receptor for the emerging human coronavirus-EMC","abstract":"Supplementary information\nThe online version of this article (doi:10.1038/nature12005) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7095326","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Nature Publishing Group UK","authors":[{"firstname":"V.

spread rapidly from China throughout the world, causing more than 800 deaths due to the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which is the severe form of acute lung injury (ALI).\n Interestingly, a novel homologue of angiotensin?converting enzyme, termed angiotensin?converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), has been identified as a receptor for SARS?CoV.\n Angiotensin?converting enzyme and ACE2 share homology in their catalytic domain and provide different key functions in the reninangiotensin system (RAS).\n Angiotensin?converting enzyme cleaves angiotensin I to generate angiotensin II, which is a key effector peptide of the system and exerts multiple biological functions, whereas ACE2 reduces angiotensin II levels.\n Importantly, our recent studies using ACE2 knockout mice have demonstrated that ACE2 protects murine lungs from ARDS.\n Furthermore, SARS?CoV infections and the Spike protein of the SARS?CoV reduce ACE2 expression.\n Notably, injection of SARS?CoV Spike into mice worsens acute lung failure in vivo, which can be attenuated by blocking the reninangiotensin pathway, suggesting that the activation of the pulmonary RAS influences the pathogenesis of ALI/ARDS and SARS.\n\n","id":"PMC7197898","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Blackwell Publishing

collected and analysed data on patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection by real-time RT-PCR and next-generation sequencing.\n\n Data were obtained with standardised data collection forms shared by WHO and the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium from electronic medical records.\n\n Researchers also directly communicated with patients or their families to ascertain epidemiological and symptom data.\n\n Outcomes were also compared between patients who had been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and those who had not.\n\n\nFindings\nBy Jan 2, 2020, 41 admitted hospital patients had been identified as having laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection.\n\n Most of the infected patients were men (30 [73%] of 41); less than half had

Of six family members who travelled to Wuhan, five were identified as infected with the novel coronavirus.\n\n Additionally, one family member, who did not travel to Wuhan, became infected with the virus after several days of contact with four of the family members.\n\n None of the family members had contacts with Wuhan markets or animals, although two had visited a Wuhan hospital.\n\n Five family members (aged 3666 years) presented with fever, upper or lower respiratory tract symptoms, or diarrhoea, or a combination of these 36 days after exposure.\n\n They presented to our hospital (The University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen) 610 days after symptom onset.\n\n They and one asymptomatic child (aged 10 years) had radiological ground-glass lung opacities.\n\n Older patients (aged &gt;60 years) had more systemic symptoms, extensive radiological ground-glass lung changes, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and increased C-reactive protein and lactate dehydrogenase levels.\n\n The nasopharyngeal or throat swabs of these six patients were negative for known respiratory microbes by point-of-care multiplex RT-PCR, but five patients (four adults and the child) were RT-PCR positive for genes encoding the internal RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and surface Spike protein of this novel coronavirus, which were confirmed by Sanger sequencing.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these five patients' RT-PCR amplicons and two full genomes by next-generation sequencing showed that this is a novel coronavirus, which is closest to the bat severe acute respiatory syndrome (SARS)-related coronaviruses found in Chinese horseshoe bats.\n\n\nInterpretation\nOur findings are consistent with person-to-person transmission of this novel coronavirus in hospital and family settings, and the reports of infected travellers in other geographical regions.\n\n\nFunding\nThe Shaw Foundation Hong Kong, Michael Seak-Kan Tong, Respiratory Viral Research Foundation Limited, Hui Ming, Hui Hoy and Chow Sin Lan Charity Fund Limited, Marina Man-Wai Lee, the Hong Kong Hainan Commercial Association South China Microbiology Research Fund, Sanming Project of Medicine (Shenzhen), and High Level-Hospital Program (Guangdong Health Commission).\n\n\n","id":"PMC7159286","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Elsevier Ltd.","authors":[{"firstname":"Jasper Fuk-Woo","surname":"Chan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Shuofeng","surname":"Yuan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Kin-Hang","surname":"Kok","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Kelvin Kai-Wang","surname":"To","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Hin","surname":"Chu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jin","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Fanfan","surname":"Xing","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jieling","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Cyril Chik-Yan","surname":"Yip","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Rosana Wing-Shan","surname":"Poon","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Hoi-Wah","surname":"Tsoi","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Simon Kam-Fai","surname":"Lo","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Kwok-Hung","surname":"Chan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Vincent Kwok-Man","surname":"Poon","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Wan-Mui","surname":"Chan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jonathan Daniel","surname":"Ip","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jian-Piao","surname":"Cai","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Vincent Chi-Chung","surname":"Cheng","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Honglin","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Christopher Kim-Ming","surname":"Hui","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Kwok-Yung","surname":"Yuen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1016/S0140-6736(20)30211-7","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Epidemiological and clinical characteristics of 99 cases of 2019 novel coronavirus pneumonia in Wuhan, China: a descriptive study","abstract":"Background\nIn December, 2019, a pneumonia associated with the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) emerged in Wuhan, China.\n\n We aimed to further clarify the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of 2019-nCoV pneumonia.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this retrospective, single-centre study, we included all confirmed cases of 2019-nCoV in Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital from Jan 1 to Jan 20, 2020.

H5N1","abstract":"Background\nQinghai Lake in central China has been at the center of debate on whether wild birds play a role in circulation of highly pathogenic avian influenza virus H5N1. In 2005, an unprecedented epizootic at Qinghai Lake killed more than 6000 migratory birds including over 3000 bar-headed geese (Anser indicus).\n\n H5N1 subsequently spread to Europe and Africa, and in following years has re-emerged in wild birds along the Central Asia flyway several times.\n\n\nMethodology/Principal Findings\nTo better understand the potential involvement of wild birds in the spread of H5N1, we studied the movements of bar-headed geese marked with GPS satellite transmitters at Qinghai Lake in relation to virus outbreaks and disease risk factors.\n\n We discovered a previously undocumented migratory pathway between Qinghai Lake and the Lhasa Valley of Tibet where 93% of the 29 marked geese overwintered.\n\n From 20032009, sixteen outbreaks in poultry or wild birds were confirmed on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, and the majority were located within the migratory pathway of the geese.\n\n Spatial and temporal concordance between goose movements and three potential H5N1 virus sources (poultry farms, a captive bar-headed goose facility, and H5N1 outbreak locations) indicated ample opportunities existed for virus spillover and infection of migratory geese on the wintering grounds.\n\n Their potential as a vector of H5N1 was supported by rapid migration movements of some geese and genetic relatedness of H5N1 virus isolated from geese in Tibet and Qinghai Lake.\n\n\nConclusions/Significance\nThis is the first study to compare phylogenetics of the virus with spatial ecology of its host, and the combined results suggest that wild birds play a role in the spread of H5N1 in this region.\n\n However, the strength of the evidence would be improved with additional sequences from both poultry and wild birds on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau where H5N1 has a clear stronghold.\n\n\n","id":"PMC3052365","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Public Library of Science","authors":[{"firstname":"Diann

Pathogenic Avian Influenza (H5N1): Pathways of Exposure at the Animal?Human Interface, a Systematic Review","abstract":"Background\nThe threat posed by highly pathogenic avian influenza A H5N1 viruses to humans remains significant, given the continued occurrence of sporadic human cases (499 human cases in 15 countries) with a high case fatality rate (approximately 60%), the endemicity in poultry populations in several countries, and the potential for reassortment with the newly emerging 2009 H1N1 pandemic strain.\n\n Therefore, we review risk factors for H5N1 infection in humans.\n\n\nMethods and Findings\nSeveral epidemiologic studies have evaluated the risk factors associated with increased risk of H5N1 infection among humans who were exposed to H5N1 viruses.\n\n Our review shows that most H5N1 cases are attributed to exposure to sick poultry.\n\n Most cases are sporadic, while occasional limited human-to-human transmission occurs.\n\n The most commonly identified factors associated with H5N1 virus infection included exposure through contact with infected blood or bodily fluids of infected poultry via food preparation practices; touching and caring for infected poultry; consuming uncooked poultry products; exposure to H5N1 via swimming or bathing in potentially virus laden ponds; and exposure to H5N1 at live bird markets.\n\n\nConclusions\nResearch has demonstrated that despite frequent and widespread contact with poultry, transmission of the H5N1 virus from poultry to humans is rare.\n\n Available research has identified several risk factors that may be associated with infection including close direct contact with poultry and transmission via the environment.\n\n However, several important data gaps remain that limit our understanding of the epidemiology of H5N1 in humans.\n\n Although infection in humans with H5N1 remains rare, human cases continue to be reported and H5N1 is now considered endemic among poultry in parts of Asia and in Egypt, providing opportunities for additional human infections and for the acquisition of virus mutations that may lead to more efficient spread among humans and other mammalian species.\n\n Collaboration between human and animal health sectors for surveillance, case investigation, virus sharing, and risk assessment is essential to monitor for potential changes in circulating H5N1 viruses and in the epidemiology of H5N1 in order to provide the best possible chance for effective mitigation of the impact of H5N1 in both poultry and humans.\n\n\nDisclaimer\nThe opinions expressed in this

in Oseltamivir-treated patients, a method based on real-time PCR using two labeled TaqMan probes was developed for its rapid detection.\n In order to validate the method, Oseltamivir specimen from treated (Oseltamivir-resistant strain from a Vietnamese patient, two Oseltamivir-treated tigers) and untreated subjects have been used for this study.\n The results thus obtained as well as those derived from clone selection and sequencing showed that TaqMan probes could clearly discriminate wild type H274 from the mutant 274Y variant.\n The sensitivity of this assay was as low as 10 copies/?l

vasodilatation, natriuresis, anti-proliferation and an increase in the bradykininNO (nitric oxide) system.\n As the catalytic efficiency of ACE2 is approximately 400-fold higher with Ang II as a substrate than with Ang I, this axis is possibly acting as a counter-regulatory system against the ACE/Ang II/AT1 receptor axis.\n The signaling pathway of the ACE2Ang-(17) axis has not yet been totally and clearly understood.\n However, a recent report suggests that the Mas oncogene acts as a receptor for Ang-(17).\n Intracellular signaling through Mas is not clear yet.\n Several factors such as Akt phosphorylation, protein kinase C activation and mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase inhibition seem to be involved in this signaling pathway.\n Further investigations are needed to clarify the regulation and mechanism of action of ACE2 and Ang-(17).\n However, this second axis through ACE2 and Ang-(17) in RAS can be an important target for the therapy of cardiovascular and metabolic disorders.\n","id":"PMC7091931","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Nature Publishing Group

data on H5N1 cases are limited.\n\n We conducted a retrospective study of 26 confirmed human H5N1 cases identified through surveillance in China from October 2005 through April 2008.\nMethodology/Principal Findings\nData were collected from hospital medical records of H5N1 cases and analyzed.\n\n The median age was 29 years (range 662) and 58% were female.\n\n Many H5N1 cases reported fever (92%) and cough (58%) at illness onset, and had lower respiratory findings of tachypnea and dyspnea at admission.\n\n All cases progressed rapidly to bilateral pneumonia.\n\n Clinical complications included acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS, 81%), cardiac failure (50%), elevated aminotransaminases (43%), and renal dysfunction (17%).\n\n Fatal cases had a lower median nadir platelet count (64.5×109 cells/L vs 93.0×109 cells/L, p?=?0.02), higher median peak lactic dehydrogenase (LDH) level (1982.5 U/L vs 1230.0 U/L, p?=?0.001), higher percentage of ARDS (94% [n?=?16] vs 56% [n?=?5], p?=?0.034) and more frequent cardiac failure (71% [n?=?12] vs 11% [n?=?1], p?=?0.011) than nonfatal cases.\n\n A higher proportion of patients who received antiviral drugs

progression to lower respiratory disease.\n\n Decreased platelet count, elevated LDH level, ARDS and cardiac failure were associated with fatal outcomes.\n\n Clinical management of H5N1 cases should be standardized in China to include early antiviral treatment for suspected H5N1 cases.\n\n\n","id":"PMC2515635","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Public Library of

Bilateral lung involvement was observed in 10/36 early patients (28%), 25/33 intermediate patients (76%), and 22/25 late patients (88%).\nIntroduction\nAn outbreak of coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) infection began in December 2019 in Wuhan, the capital of central China's Hubei province. While the virus likely has a zoonotic origin related to the city's Huanan Seafood Market, widespread human-to-human transmission has resulted in 73,451 cases in 26 countries with 1,875 deaths as of February 18, 2020 [ - ]. Disease was first reported in the United States on January 20, 2020, and the total number of cases in the United States has reached 15 as of February 17, 2020. The most common presenting clinical symptoms are fever and cough in addition to other non-specific symptomatology including dyspnea, headache, muscle soreness, and fatigue. About 20% of cases are severe, and mortality is approximately 3%. The World Health Organization (WHO) declared a global health emergency on January 30, 2020.\nThis is the seventh known coronavirus to infect humans. Two other notable examples include severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), the former of which began in southern China and resulted in 774 deaths out of 8,098 infected individuals in 29 countries from November 2002 through July 2003, and the latter of which originated in Saudi Arabia and was responsible for 848 deaths among 2,458 individuals in 27 countries through July 2019.\nAs clinical physicians, epidemiologists, virologists, phylogeneticists, and others work with public health officials and policymakers to understand infection pathogenesis and control disease spread, some early investigators have observed imaging patterns on chest radiography and computed tomography (CT) [ - ]. For instance, an initial prospective analysis in Wuhan revealed bilateral lung opacities on 40 of 41 (98%) chest CTs in infected patients and described lobular and subsegmental areas of consolidation as the most typical findings. Other investigators examined chest CTs in 21 infected patients and found high rates of ground-glass opacities and consolidation, sometimes with a rounded morphology and peripheral lung distribution. Another group evaluated lung abnormalities related to disease time course and found that chest CT showed the most extensive disease approximately ten days after symptom onset.. Thoracic radiology evaluation is often key to the evaluation of patients suspected of COVID-19 infection. Prompt recognition of disease is invaluable to ensure timely treatment, and from a public health perspective, rapid patient isolation is crucial for containment of this communicable disease.\nIn this study, we characterize chest CT findings in 121 patients infected with COVID-19 in China in relationship to the time between symptom onset and the initial CT scan. This study builds on initial work by early investigators during the first few weeks of the outbreak by evaluating a larger number of patients as well as by examining imaging features as the disease moves into the more subacute phase and/or earlier detection with increased vigilance for detection. We hypothesized that certain CT findings may be more common depending on the time course of infection.\nMaterials and Methods\nOur institutional review board (IRB) waived written informed consent for this retrospective study that evaluated de-identified data and involved no potential risk to patients. To avert any potential breach of confidentiality, no link between the patients and the researchers was made available.\nFrom January 18, 2020, until February 2, 2020, 121 adult patients admitted to four hospitals in four provinces in China with confirmed COVID-19 and who underwent chest CT were enrolled in our study. Twenty-one of these patients were previously evaluated on our prior study focusing on the CT imaging manifestations of COVID-19, but were reevaluated for the purposes of this new study. Patient selection was consecutive in each of the four institutions, and the solitary exclusion criteria was patient age &lt; 18 years (Table 1). In addition to age and gender, clinical information collected included travel and exposure history (when known). All patients were positive for COVID-19 via laboratory testing with real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) of respiratory secretions obtained by bronchoalveolar lavage, endotracheal aspirate, nasopharyngeal swab, or oropharyngeal swab. In addition, the number of rRT-PCR tests performed on each patient was tabulated (when known), on which test a positive result was found was tabulated, and the number of days between symptomology onset and date of first positive test was tracked. The rRT-PCR test kits used on the patients in this study were manufactured by Sansure Biotech Inc. (Changsha, China), Shanghai Zhijiang Biotechnology Co. (Shanghai, China), or Da An Gene Co. (Guangzhuo, China).\nPatient Characteristics\nTwenty-two patients were from Nanchang (Jiangxi Province) and were imaged with 8-mm slice thickness CT on a Siemens Emotion 16 scanner (Siemens Healthineers; Erlangen, Germany). Sixty-nine patients were from Zhuhai (Guangdong Province) and were imaged with 1-mm slice thickness CT on a UCT 760 scanner (United Imaging; Shanghai, China). Twenty-two patients were from Chengdu (Sichuan province) and were imaged with 1-mm slice thickness CT on a Revolution scanner (GE Medical Systems; Milwaukee, WI). Eight patients were from Guilin (Guangxi province) and were imaged with 1-mm slice thickness CT on a Philips Brilliance Big Bore scanner (Philips; Amsterdam, Netherlands). All scans were performed without intravenous contrast with the patient in the supine position during end-inspiration. Only the initial chest CTs were evaluated; if a patient had a follow-up CT during the study time window, it was not analyzed for this study.\nAll CT images were reviewed by two fellowship-trained cardiothoracic radiologists with approximately five years of experience each (A.B., M.C.) using a viewing console. Imaging was reviewed independently and final decisions reached by consensus are reported. No negative control cases were examined.\nFor each patient, the chest CT scan was evaluated for the following characteristics: (1) presence of ground-glass opacities, (2) presence of consolidation, (3) laterality of ground-glass opacities and consolidation, (4) number of lobes affected where either ground-glass or consolidative opacities were present, (5) degree of involvement of each lung lobe in addition to overall extent of lung involvement measured by means of a &quot;total severity score&quot; as detailed below, (6) presence of nodules, (7) presence of a pleural effusion, (8) presence of thoracic lymphadenopathy (defined as lymph node size of &gt;=10 mm in short-axis dimension), (9) airways abnormalities (including airway wall thickening, bronchiectasis, and endoluminal secretions), (10) axial distribution of disease (categorized as no axial distribution of disease, central &quot;peribronchovascular&quot; predominant disease, or peripheral predominant disease), and (11) presence of underlying lung disease such as emphysema or fibrosis. Other abnormalities, including linear opacities, opacities with a rounded morphology, opacities with a &quot;reverse halo&quot; sign, opacities with a &quot;crazy-paving&quot; pattern, and opacities with intralesional cavitation, were noted. Ground-glass opacification was defined as hazy increased lung attenuation with preservation of bronchial and vascular margins, whereas consolidation was defined as opacification with obscuration of margins of vessels and airway walls. Each of the five lung lobes was assessed for degree of involvement and classified as none (0%), minimal (1 - 25%), mild (26 - 50%), moderate (51 - 75%), or severe (76 - 100%). No involvement corresponded to a lobe score of 0, minimal to a lobe score of 1, mild to a lobe score of 2, moderate to a lobe score of 3, and severe to a lobe score of 4. An overall lung &quot;total severity score&quot; was reached by summing the five lobe scores (range of possible scores, 0 - 20).\nThe amount of time between the initial appearance of patient symptoms (such as fever, cough, etc.) and the date of both the first positive rRT-PCR test as well as the date of the initial chest CT examination was noted for each patient. Twenty seven patients were excluded because the date of first symptom appearance was unknown, leaving 94 patients for analysis. If the time interval between first clinical symptom and CT was two days or less (36 of 94 patients), the patient was considered to have been imaged in the &quot;early&quot; phase of illness. If the time interval was between three and five days (33 of 94 patients), the patient was considered to have been imaged in the &quot;intermediate&quot; phase of illness. If the time interval was between six and 12 days (25 of 94 patients), the patient was considered to have been imaged in the &quot;late&quot; phase of illness.\nResults\nThere were 61 men and 60 women studied with mean age 45.3 years (age range 18 - 80 years with standard deviation 16 years).\nOf the 121 patients, 27 (22%) had no ground-glass opacities and no consolidation on chest CT (Table 2). Of the 94 patients with ground-glass opacities, consolidation, or both, 41 (34%) had only ground-glass opacities (with no consolidation), and two patients (2%) had consolidation in the absence of ground-glass opacities. Eighteen patients (15%) had opacities in one lobe, 14 patients (12%) had two affected lobes, 11 patients (9%) had three affected lobes, 18 patients (15%) had four affected lobes, and 33 patients (27%) had disease affecting all five lobes.\nFindings on Chest CT in 121 Patients\nThe right upper lobe was involved in 53 of 121 patients (44%), the right middle lobe was involved in 50 patients (41%), the right lower lobe was involved in 79 patients (65%), the left upper lobe was involved in 58 patients (48%), and the left lower lobe was involved in 76 patients (63%). Seventy-three of 121 patients (60%) had bilateral lung disease (Figure 1). Twenty (17%) patients had exclusively unilateral lung involvement, including 13 patients that had only right lung involvement (Figure 2) and 7 patients that had only left lung involvement. The mean total lung severity score for the 121 patients was 3 (range 0 - 18 with standard deviation 3). Thoracic lymphadenopathy, lung cavitation, and pulmonary nodules were notably absent in all 121 patients, and only 1 patient (1%) had a pleural effusion (a trace left effusion) (Table 3).\nAn axial CT image obtained without intravenous contrast in a 36-year-old male (Panel A) shows bilateral ground-glass opacities in the upper lobes with a rounded morphology (arrows). An axial CT image obtained in a 44-year-old male (Panel B) shows larger groundglass opacities in the bilateral lower lobes with a rounded morphology (arrows).

The left lung was normal.\nImaging Characteristics on Chest CT in 121 Patients\nThe time between initial onset of symptoms and subsequent chest CT was known for 94 patients and assigned as early (0-2 days), intermediate (3-5 days), or late (6-12 days). The frequency of ground-glass opacities and consolidation was far fewer in the early group as compared with the intermediate and late groups (Table 4, Figures 3 and 4). Twenty of 36 early patients (56%, 95%CI 47-65%) had no lung opacities as compared with three of 33 intermediate patients (9%) and 1 of 25 (4%) late patients. Bilateral lung involvement was observed in 10 of 36 early patients (28%), 25 of 33 intermediate patients (76%), and 22 of 25 late patients (88%). The mean total severity score was 1 (standard deviation (SD) = 1) for early patients, 4 (SD=2), for intermediate patients and 6 (SD= 4) for late patients.\nFindings on Chest CT in Patients Categorized by Infection Time Course\nAn axial CT image obtained without intravenous contrast in a 42-year-old male in the &quot;late&quot; time group (10 days from symptom onset to this CT) shows bilateral consolidative opacities, with a striking peripheral distribution in the right lower lobe (solid arrows), and with a rounded morphology in the left lower lobe (dashed arrow).\nFrequency of selected chest CT findings as a function of time course from symptom onset.\nLinear opacities, a &quot;crazy-paving&quot; pattern, and a &quot;reverse halo&quot; sign were all absent in the early group, but were present in the late group 20%, 20%, and 4% of the time, respectively (Figure 5). In terms of distribution of disease in the axial plane, peripheral distribution was found in 8 of 36 early patients (22%), 21 of 33 intermediate patients (64%), and 18 of 25 of late patients (72%).\nAn axial CT image obtained without intravenous contrast in a 43 year old female (Panel A) shows a &quot;crazy-paving&quot; pattern as manifested by right lower lobe ground-glass opacification with interlobular septal thickening (arrows) with intralobular lines. An axial CT image obtained in a 22-year old-female (Panel B) shows an area of faint ground-glass opacification in the left upper lobe with a ring of denser consolidation (arrow, &quot;reverse halo&quot; sign).\nAn axial CT image obtained without intravenous contrast in a 43 year old female (Panel A) shows a &quot;crazy-paving&quot; pattern as manifested by right lower lobe ground-glass opacification with interlobular septal thickening (arrows) with intralobular lines. An axial CT image obtained in a 22-year old-female (Panel B) shows an area of faint ground-glass opacification in the left upper lobe with a ring of denser consolidation (arrow, &quot;reverse halo&quot; sign).\nAll patients eventually had positive rRT-PCR for Covid-19. Of the 121 patients in this study, the date of the first positive rRT-PCR test was known in 102 of patients. There were 90 of 102 (88%) positive on the first test, including 33/36 (92%) in the early group, 28/33 (85%) in the intermediate group, and 23/25 (92%) in the late group. The mean number of days between symptom onset and first positive rRT-PCR result was 4.5 days for all 102 patients (range 0 - 18 days), 2.3 days for the early group (range 0 - 7 days), 4.7 days for the intermediate group (range 0 - 18 days), and 7.2 days for the late group (range 1 - 12 days).\nDiscussion\nAn average of 3,605 new cases of COVID-19 have been reported per day since our preliminary research was published on February 4, 2020. Just as clinicians are evaluating more suspected patients, radiologists are similarly interpreting more chest CTs in those suspected of infection. Chest CT is a vital component in the diagnostic algorithm for patients with suspected COVID-19 infection. Indeed, given the limited number of rRT-PCR kits in some centers and the possibility of false negative rRT-PCR results, the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China has encouraged diagnosis based on clinical and chest CT findings alone. In this study of 121 patients with confirmed Covid-19 infection, it is noteworthy that 20/36 (56%) of patients imaged 0-2 days ('early') after symptom onset had a normal CT with complete absence of ground-glass opacities and consolidation (as opposed to 3/33 [9%] of intermediate patients and 1/25 [4%] of late patients). Only one of these patients (who was in the early group) had an initially negative rRT-PCR result, suggesting that rRT-PCR is positive even in patients with normal chest CT. Chest CT therefore has limited sensitivity and negative predictive value early after symptom onset, and is thereby unlikely a reliable standalone tool to rule out COVID-19 infection.\nOther findings of this work largely concur with early radiology investigative efforts insofar as this pattern of ground-glass and consolidative pulmonary opacities, often with a bilateral and peripheral lung distribution, is emerging as the chest CT hallmark of COVID-19 infection. This pattern of disease, somewhat similar to that described in earlier coronavirus outbreaks such as SARS and MERS, also dovetails with the blueprint thoracic radiologists recognize as the archetypal response to acute lung injury whereby an initial (often infectious or inflammatory) acute insult causes ground-glass opacities that may coalesce into dense consolidative lesions, and then progressively evolve and organize in often a more linear fashion with predilection for the lung periphery (and somewhat with a &quot;crazy&quot; paving pattern or emergence of a &quot;reverse halo&quot; sign). The findings in this study, which highlight the increased frequency of such findings as consolidation, bilateral disease, greater total lung involvement, linear opacities, a &quot;crazy-paving&quot; pattern, appearance of the &quot;reverse halo&quot; sign, and peripheral lung distribution in patients imaged with CT a longer time after symptomatology starts, represent the CT correlate for the underlying pathophysiology of the disease process as it organizes. Moreover, the notable absence of ancillary chest CT findings such as lymphadenopathy, pleural effusions, pulmonary nodules, and lung cavitation likewise are consistent with early case descriptions.\nThere are several limitations to our study. Firstly, some patients were unable to be included in the evaluation of infection time course because of incomplete clinical histories where the precise time of symptom onset was unknown. Furthermore, some patients may have received medical intervention once suspected or confirmed to have infection (perhaps antimicrobial therapy, fluid administration, or steroid therapy may affect chest CT findings), which was not accounted for in this work. In addition, there may have been a selection bias in these institutions in terms of which patients were imaged with CT. For instance, if more clinically ill patients were more likely to be imaged sooner or imaged at all, then this may have an impact on results (although the opposite effect was observed in this study whereby those with the most severe lung involvement had a longer time between symptom onset and CT scan).\nOur investigative efforts have demonstrated that frequency of CT findings is related to infection time course. Our data largely concur with work by Pan et al that demonstrated preponderance of ground-glass abnormality in early disease, followed by development of crazy paving, and finally increasing consolidation later in the disease course. Meanwhile, the outbreak is at a stage of evolving from the acute to a more subacute phase in many patients. Recognizing imaging patterns based on infection time course is paramount for not only understanding the pathophysiology and natural history of infection, but also for helping to predict patient progression and potential complication development. Eventually, as infection duration in a large number of patients extends from the acute and subacute phases to either a completely healed outcome or to a chronic phase in patients over the coming several weeks and months, future investigators may evaluate imaging findings in chronic patients. Such work could evaluate if long-term complications absent in this study (such as pleural effusions, empyema, lymphadenopathy, and lung cavitation) potentially arise.\nGrants, Disclosures, or Other Assistance of Authors: None.\nIRB Statement: IRB approval was waived for this study.\nReferences\nA novel coronavirus from patients with pneumonia in China, 2019\nA novel coronavirus genome identified in a cluster of pneumonia cases - Wuhan, China 2019-2020\nA familiar cluster of pneumonia associated with the 2019 novel coronavirus indicating person-to-person transmission: a study of a family cluster\nClinical features of patients infected with 2019 novel coronavirus in Wuhan, China\nImportation and human-to-human transmission of a novel coronavirus in Vietnam\nEarly transmission dynamics in Wuhan, China, of novel coronavirus-infected pneumonia\nFirst case of 2019 novel coronavirus in the United States\nUpdated understanding of the outbreak of 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) in Wuhan, China\nA novel coronavirus outbreak of global health concern\nChina coronavirus: WHO declares international emergency as death toll exceeds 200\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome: clinical and laboratory manifestations\nThe Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS)\nThe novel coronavirus in Wuhan, China: challenges for global health governance\nThe extent of transmission of novel coronavirus in Wuhan, China, 2020\nTime course of lung changes on chest CT during recovery from 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pneumonia\nChest CT for typical 2019-nCoV pneumonia: relationship to negative RT-PCR testing\nCT manifestations of two cases of 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) pneumonia\nEmerging coronavirus 2019-nCoV pneumonia\nImaging profile of the COVID-19 infection: radiologic findings and literature review\nChest imaging appearance of COVID-19 infection\nThe many faces of COVID-19: spectrum of imaging manifestations\nLongitudinal CT findings in COVID-19 pneumonia: case presenting organizing pneumonia pattern\nSpectrum of chest CT findings in a familial cluster of COVID-19 infection\nCOVID-19 infection presenting with CT halo sign\nCT imaging features of 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV)\nFleischner Society: glossary of terms for thoracic imaging\nChina's Hubei reports jump in new cases of COVID-19 after diagnosis criteria revision\n","References depth 1":[{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"A novel coronavirus from patients with pneumonia in China, 2019","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[],"References depth 2":[{"doi":"10.1016/S0140-6736(20)30183-5","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Clinical features of patients infected with 2019 novel coronavirus in Wuhan, China","abstract":"Background\nA recent cluster of pneumonia cases in Wuhan, China, was caused by a novel betacoronavirus, the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).\n\n We report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatment and clinical outcomes of these patients.\n\n\nMethods\nAll patients with suspected 2019-nCoV were admitted to a designated hospital in Wuhan.\n\n We prospectively collected and analysed data on patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection by real-time RT-PCR and next-generation sequencing.\n\n Data were obtained with standardised data collection forms shared by WHO and the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium from electronic medical records.\n\n Researchers also directly communicated with patients or their families to ascertain epidemiological and symptom data.\n\n Outcomes were also compared between patients who had been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and those who had not.\n\n\nFindings\nBy Jan 2, 2020, 41 admitted hospital patients had been identified as having laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection.\n\n Most of the infected patients were men (30 [73%] of 41);

mortality in critical illness: an observational cohort study","abstract":"Introduction\nThe neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) is a biological marker that has been shown to be associated with outcomes in patients with a number of different malignancies.\n\n The objective of this study was to assess the relationship between NLR and mortality in a population of adult critically ill patients.\n\n\nMethods\nWe performed an observational cohort study of unselected intensive care unit (ICU) patients based on records in a large clinical database.\n\n We computed individual patient NLR and categorized patients by quartile of this ratio.\n\n The association of NLR quartiles and 28-day mortality was assessed using multivariable logistic regression.\n\n Secondary outcomes included mortality in the ICU, in-hospital mortality and 1-year mortality.\n\n An a priori subgroup analysis of patients with versus without sepsis was performed to assess any differences in the relationship between the NLR and outcomes in these cohorts.\n\n\nResults\nA total of 5,056 patients were included.\n\n Their 28-day mortality rate was 19%.\n\n The median age of the cohort was 65 years, and 47% were female.\n\n The median NLR for the entire cohort was 8.9 (interquartile range, 4.99 to 16.21).\n\n Following multivariable adjustments, there was a stepwise increase in mortality with increasing quartiles of NLR (first quartile: reference category; second quartile odds ratio (OR) = 1.32; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.03 to 1.71; third quartile OR = 1.43; 95% CI, 1.12 to 1.83; 4th quartile OR = 1.71; 95% CI, 1.35 to 2.16).\n\n A similar stepwise relationship was identified in the subgroup of patients who presented without sepsis.\n\n The NLR was not associated with 28-day mortality in patients with sepsis.\n\n Increasing quartile of NLR was statistically significantly associated with secondary outcome.\n\n\nConclusion\nThe NLR is associated with outcomes in unselected critically ill patients.\n\n In patients with sepsis, there was no statistically significant relationship between NLR and mortality.\n\n Further investigation is required to increase understanding of the pathophysiology of this relationship and to validate these findings with data collected prospectively.\n\n\nElectronic supplementary material\nThe online version of this article

a major threat to public health13.\n Despite intense research efforts, how, when and where new diseases appear are still a source of considerable uncertainty.\n A severe respiratory disease was recently reported in Wuhan, Hubei province, China.\n As of 25 January 2020, at least 1,975 cases had been reported since the first patient was hospitalized on 12 December 2019. Epidemiological investigations have suggested that the outbreak was associated with a seafood market in Wuhan.\n Here we study a single patient who was a worker at the market and who was admitted to the Central Hospital of Wuhan on 26 December 2019 while experiencing a severe respiratory syndrome that included fever, dizziness and a cough.\n Metagenomic RNA sequencing4 of a sample of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from the patient identified a new RNA virus strain from the family Coronaviridae, which is designated here WH-Human 1 coronavirus (and has also been referred to as 2019-nCoV).\n Phylogenetic analysis of the complete viral genome (29,903 nucleotides) revealed that the virus was most closely related (89.1% nucleotide similarity) to a group of SARS-like coronaviruses (genus Betacoronavirus, subgenus Sarbecovirus) that had previously been found in bats in China5.\n This outbreak highlights the ongoing ability of viral spill-over from animals to cause

Of six family members who travelled to Wuhan, five were identified as infected with the novel coronavirus.\n\n Additionally, one family member, who did not travel to Wuhan, became infected with the virus after several days of contact with four of the family members.\n\n None of the family members had contacts with Wuhan markets or animals, although two had visited a Wuhan hospital.\n\n Five family members (aged 3666 years) presented with fever, upper or lower respiratory tract symptoms, or diarrhoea, or a combination of these 36 days after exposure.\n\n They presented to our hospital (The University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen) 610 days after symptom onset.\n\n They and one asymptomatic child (aged 10 years) had radiological ground-glass lung opacities.\n\n Older patients (aged &gt;60 years) had more systemic symptoms, extensive radiological ground-glass lung changes, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and increased C-reactive protein and lactate dehydrogenase levels.\n\n The nasopharyngeal or throat swabs of these six patients were negative for known respiratory microbes by point-of-care multiplex RT-PCR, but five patients (four adults and the child) were RT-PCR positive for genes encoding the internal RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and surface Spike protein of this novel coronavirus, which were confirmed by Sanger sequencing.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these five patients' RT-PCR amplicons and two full genomes by next-generation sequencing showed that this is a novel coronavirus, which is closest to the bat severe acute respiatory syndrome (SARS)-related coronaviruses found in Chinese horseshoe bats.\n\n\nInterpretation\nOur findings are consistent with person-to-person transmission of this novel coronavirus in hospital and family settings, and the reports of infected travellers in other geographical regions.\n\n\nFunding\nThe Shaw Foundation Hong Kong, Michael Seak-Kan Tong, Respiratory Viral Research Foundation Limited, Hui

features of patients infected with 2019 novel coronavirus in Wuhan, China","abstract":"Background\nA recent cluster of pneumonia cases in Wuhan, China, was caused by a novel betacoronavirus, the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).\n\n We report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatment and clinical outcomes of these patients.\n\n\nMethods\nAll patients with suspected 2019-nCoV were admitted to a designated hospital in Wuhan.\n\n We prospectively collected and analysed data on patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection by real-time RT-PCR and next-generation sequencing.\n\n Data were obtained with standardised data collection forms shared by WHO and the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium from electronic medical records.\n\n Researchers also directly communicated with patients or their families to ascertain epidemiological and symptom data.\n\n Outcomes were also compared between patients who had been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and those who had not.\n\n\nFindings\nBy Jan 2, 2020, 41 admitted hospital patients had been identified as having laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection.\n\n Most of the infected patients were men (30 [73%] of 41); less than half had underlying diseases (13 [32%]), including diabetes (eight [20%]), hypertension (six [15%]), and cardiovascular disease (six [15%]).\n\n Median age was 49·0 years (IQR 41·058·0).\n\n 27 (66%) of 41 patients had been exposed to Huanan seafood market.\n\n One family cluster was found.\n\n Common symptoms at onset of illness were fever (40 [98%] of 41 patients), cough (31 [76%]), and myalgia or fatigue (18 [44%]); less common symptoms were sputum production (11 [28%] of 39), headache (three [8%] of 38), haemoptysis (two [5%] of 39), and diarrhoea (one [3%] of 38).\n\n Dyspnoea developed in 22 (55%) of 40 patients (median time from illness onset to dyspnoea 8·0 days [IQR 5·013·0]).\n\n 26 (63%) of 41 patients had lymphopenia.\n\n All 41 patients had pneumonia with abnormal findings on chest CT.\n\n Complications included acute respiratory distress syndrome (12 [29%]), RNAaemia (six [15%]), acute cardiac injury (five [12%]) and secondary infection (four [10%]).\n\n 13 (32%) patients were admitted to an ICU and six (15%) died.\n\n Compared with non-ICU patients, ICU patients had higher plasma levels of IL2, IL7, IL10, GSCF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNF?.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe 2019-nCoV infection caused clusters of severe respiratory illness similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and was associated with ICU admission and high mortality.\n\n Major gaps in our knowledge of the origin, epidemiology, duration of human transmission, and clinical spectrum of disease need fulfilment by future studies.\n\n\nFunding\nMinistry of Science and Technology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, National Natural Science Foundation of China,

lower than the estimate among Japanese on the order of 80% and far below the quoted goal of 90%.\n This finding indicates a critical need to investigate the underlying mechanisms, including disparate access to HIV testing.\n","id":"PMC6616594","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"MDPI","authors":[{"firstname":"Kazuki","surname":"Shimizu","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Hiroshi","surname":"Nishiura","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Hiroshi","surname":"Nishiura","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Akifumi","surname":"Imamura","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Akifumi","surname":"Imamura","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1016/S1473-3099(09)70069-6","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Incubation periods of acute respiratory viral infections: a systematic review","abstract":"Knowledge of the incubation period is essential in the investigation and control of infectious disease, but statements of incubation period are often poorly referenced, inconsistent, or based on limited data.\n In a systematic review of the literature on nine respiratory viral infections of public-health importance, we identified 436 articles with statements of incubation period and 38 with data for pooled analysis.\n We fitted a log-normal distribution to pooled data and found the median incubation period to be 5·6 days (95% CI 4·86·3) for adenovirus, 3·2 days (95% CI 2·83·7) for human coronavirus, 4·0 days (95% CI 3·64·4) for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, 1·4 days (95% CI 1·31·5) for influenza A, 0·6 days (95% CI 0·50·6) for influenza B, 12·5 days (95% CI 11·813·3) for measles, 2·6 days (95% CI 2·13·1) for parainfluenza, 4·4 days (95% CI 3·94·9) for respiratory syncytial virus, and 1·9 days (95% CI 1·42·4) for rhinovirus.\n When using the incubation period, it is important to consider its full distribution: the right tail for quarantine policy, the central regions for likely times and sources of infection, and the full distribution for models used in pandemic planning.\n Our estimates combine published data to give the detail necessary for these and other applications.\n","id":"PMC4327893","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Elsevier Ltd.","authors":[{"firstname":"Justin","surname":"Lessler","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Nicholas G","surname":"Reich","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ron","surname":"Brookmeyer","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Trish M","surname":"Perl","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Kenrad E","surname":"Nelson","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Derek AT","surname":"Cummings","email":"dcumming@jhsph.edu","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Outbreak of Patients with Pneumonia Associated with Novel Coronavirus","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Novel Coronavirus:Thailand (ex-China)","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Ministry of Public Health Receives 2 Tourists from Wuhan for Pneumonia at Bamrasnaradura Institute","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"First Confirmed Case of New Coronavirus Pneumonia in Taiwan","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Case of 2019 Novel Coronavirus Confirmed in Washington State Resident","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Macau Confirms First Wuhan Virus Case, Tightens Screening in Casinos","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Wuhan Virus: 2 More Cases Confirmed in Thailand","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Confirmed imported case of novel coronavirus infection in Singapore;
