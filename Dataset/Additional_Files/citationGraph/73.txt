This study aimed to disclose the association between statins and 60-day COVID-19 mortality.\nApproach and Results:\nAll patients hospitalized with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 were enrolled in this study from January 19 to April 16, 2020, in Korea. We evaluated the association between the use of statins and COVID-19-related mortality in the overall and the nested 1:2 propensity score-matched study. Furthermore, a comparison of the hazard ratio for death was performed between COVID-19 patients and a retrospective cohort of patients hospitalized with pneumonia between January and June 2019 in Korea. The median age of the 10 448 COVID-19 patients was 45 years. Statins were prescribed in 533 (5.1%) patients. After adjusting for age, sex, and comorbidities, Cox regression showed a significant decrease in hazard ratio associated with the use of statins (hazard ratio, 0.637 [95% CI, 0.425-0.953]; P=0.0283). Moreover, on comparing the hazard ratio between COVID-19 patients and the retrospective cohort of hospitalized pneumonia patients, the use of statins showed similar benefits.\nConclusions:\nThe use of statins correlates significantly with lower mortality in patients with COVID-19, consistent with the findings in patients with pneumonia.\nHighlights\nThe use of statins was significantly associated with lower mortality in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients.\nThe protective effect of statins was similar to pneumonia patients in Korea, in 2019.\nStatins can be considered as a part of the supportive regimen during the treatment of COVID-19.\nCoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in Wuhan, Hubei, China, in December 2019 and since then became a pandemic, as declared by the World Health Organization on March 11, 2020. As of October 20, &gt;40 118 333 confirmed cases and 1 114 749 deaths have been reported worldwide. Although the fatality rate associated with SARS-CoV-2 is lower than that in the context of SARS-CoV or Middle East respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus, the elderly and people experiencing chronic conditions are prone to serious outcomes.\nThe most common comorbidities among COVID-19 patients include hypertension, diabetes, and coronary artery disease; therefore, frequently, such patients are treated with HMG-CoA (hydroxy-methyl-glutaryl-coenzyme A) reductase inhibitors, known as statins. Of note, statin treatment was reported to increase the expression of ACE2 (angiotensin-converting enzyme 2) in the heart of experimental models via epigenetic histone modifications. Given that SARS-CoV-2 enters the target cell via ACE2 cell surface receptors, the use of statins in the context of COVID-19 initially brought some concerns. In fact, the increased expression of ACE2 was shown to facilitate infection with SARS-CoV; therefore, statins might increase the risk of COVID-19. In contrast, besides their lipid-lowering activity, statins are well known for pleiotropic effects on inflammation, contributing to their beneficial impact in patients with conditions other than cardiovascular diseases, including autoimmune diseases, community-acquired pneumonia, and sepsis. The immunomodulatory effect of statins depends on the inhibition of the production of isoprenoids and the consequent downregulation of redox-sensitive proinflammatory transcription factors such as NF-kappaB (nuclear factor-kappaB). Moreover, statins were suggested to potentially inhibit the SARS-CoV-2 main protease:a key coronavirus enzyme:thus exerting antiviral activity. Of note, previously, statins were effective in targeting the host response and preventing endothelial barrier damage in patients infected with the Ebola virus during the recent Ebola outbreak in West Africa. Therefore, some hospitals included stains in the COVID-19 treatment protocol.\nKorea has registered all SARS-CoV-2-infected patients and managed them either in hospitals or in community treatment centers; therefore, follow-up information is available for all patients. Therefore, Korea offers the ideal scenario to comprehensively evaluate the association between the use of statins and the severity of COVID-19. Therefore, in the present study, we investigated the association between the use of statins and COVID-19-related deaths in all COVID-19 patients in Korea. Moreover, the hazard ratio (HR) was compared between COVID-19 patients and a retrospective cohort of patients hospitalized with pneumonia between January and June 2019 in Korea.\nMethods\nStudy Design\nWe report a population-based cohort study supported by the Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency, the National Health Insurance Service, and the Korean Society of Hypertension. The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Seoul National University Hospital (No. 2003-102-1109). Informed consent was waived by the institutional review board. All authors reviewed the manuscript for the accuracy and completeness of the data.\nData Collection\nData related to all of the 10 448 patients, with laboratory-confirmed infection with SARS-CoV-2 since the first case on January 19 up to April 16, 2020, in Korea, were retrieved from the compiled information available at the National Health Insurance Service. A case designated confirmed for COVID-19 was defined as one whose nasal and pharyngeal swab specimens tested positive in the context of high-throughput sequencing or real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction assays. Diagnoses, prescription records, and information related to medical utilization were extracted from the national health information database:a public database compiled by the National Health Insurance Service. Furthermore, for the National Health Insurance Service claim data analysis, operational definitions using the ICD-10-CM (International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification) codes were applied (Table I in the Data Supplement).\nThe association between the use of statins and the severity of pneumonia in hospitalized Korean patients between January and June 2019 was investigated using the information retrieved from the national health information database. Of note, the national health information database holds information related to health care utilization, health screening, sociodemographic variables, and mortality of the entire Korean population; overall, the information available refers to data gathered during the process of claiming health care services. It includes information related to the records of inpatient and outpatient usage (diagnosis, length of stay, treatment costs, and services received) and prescription records (drug code, days prescribed, and daily dosage). Importantly, in our analysis, all potential identifiers in the national health information database data were removed, and the information was linked with new unidentifiable codes representing individual patients.\nStudy Outcomes and Definitions\nIn the present study, the association between the use of statins and COVID-19-related mortality within 60 days was investigated. All commercially available statins (atorvastatin, fluvastatin, lovastatin, pitavastatin, pravastatin, rosuvastatin, and simvastatin) in Korea were included in the analysis. Dichotomous variables were created to identify the use of statins defined as a filled prescription with &gt;60% of the proportion of days covered during 3 months before the diagnosis of COVID-19.\nStatistical Analysis\nThe association of the clinical characteristics with mortality within 60 days was tested using bivariate statistics. Continuous variables were analyzed using t test, and categorical variables were analyzed with the chi2 test. The time to occurrence of the COVID-19-related death in patients prescribed with statins was analyzed using Kaplan-Meier survival curves displaying the failure functions. Statistical significance was assessed using the log-rank test. Moreover, a Cox proportional hazard model was used for the estimation of unadjusted HRs and 95% CIs for statins. The additional factors included in the model as covariates were age group, sex, comorbidities including hypertension, type 2 diabetes, coronary heart diseases, heart failure, stroke, chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder (COPD), cancer, and chronic kidney diseases. To control confounding biases, we performed propensity score matching (PSM) using sex, age at diagnosis, and history of comorbidities (hypertension, diabetes, coronary artery disease, and COPD) in both study populations. Each statin user was matched with 2 nonstatin users; the details are provided in Tables II and VII in the Data Supplement. We diagnosed the proportional hazard assumption using the goodness-of-fit test and the Schoenfeld residual plots. Furthermore, we similarly analyzed with pneumonia 2019 patients. We standardized the difference of the coefficient of prior statin use for risk of death between COVID-19 patients and pneumonia patients in 2019. If the absolute value of Z score is &gt;1.96, we regarded that the comparative analyses show the significant difference. P&lt;0.05 was considered statistically significant. All analyses were performed using SAS, version 7.15 (SAS Institute, Inc, Cary, NC), and R, version 4.0.0 (R Development Core Team, Vienna, Austria).\nRole of the Funding Source\nThis study was supported by a research grant from the Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency (No. 4838-330-320-01) and by the Seoul National University Hospital (No. 04-2020-0030). The Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency supported the organization of the National Committee for Clinical Management of Emerging Infectious Diseases, which conducted this study.\nResults\nThe present study includes data related to a total of 10 448 COVID-19 patients who were hospitalized in Korea from January 19, 2020, through April 16, 2020. As of April 24, 2020, 228 of these patients (2.18%) died. Among them, 533 statin and 1066 nonstatin users were examined in the nested case-control study.\nThe demographic and clinical characteristics of the patients in the cohort and the nested 1:2 matched study are summarized in Table 1. Of the patients, 60% were women. The median age of all patients was 45 years; of note, 4.8% were aged &lt;=19 years, 20.3% were aged 60 to 79 years, and 5.1% were aged &gt;=80 years. Furthermore, 38.1% had at least one preexisting comorbidity; 20.6% had hypertension, 17.9% had diabetes, 14.2% had COPD, and 4.5% had cancer. Patients prescribed with statins were &gt;20 years older with a higher number of comorbidities than that of the nonusers and accounted for 5.1% of the overall cases. On the other hand, most of variables in the nested matched study are balanced, compared with the overall cohort (Table II in the Data Supplement).\nClinical Characteristics of COVID-19 Patients\nThe crude HRs of elderly (&gt;65 years) and hypertension were 36.5 ([95% CI, 24.6-54.2] P&lt;0.0001) and 14.1 ([95% CI, 10.3-19.2] P&lt;0.0001) in the overall cohort, respectively (Table 2). Even in the context of multivariate regression analysis, old age (&gt;65 years) was by far the most important predictor of COVID-19-related mortality in patients. After adjusting for age, sex, and the history of comorbidities (hypertension, diabetes, cancer, COPD, stroke, coronary artery disease, heart failure, and chronic renal disease) before the diagnosis of COVID-19, Cox regression showed a significant decrease in HR associated with the use of statins (HR, 0.637 [95% CI, 0.425-0.953]; P=0.0283; Figure 1A). Next, the association of statins was stratified by age, sex, and comorbidities. A decreased risk of death with statin use was consistent across all subgroups (Figure 2). After PSM, Cox regression showed a more significant decrease in HR by 45% associated with the use of statins (HR, 0.553 [95% CI, 0.360-0.852]; P=0.0071; Table III in the Data Supplement).\nResults of Univariable and Multivariable Regression Analysis for the COVID-19 Mortality Within 60 d (Overall Cohort)\nSurvival within 60 d in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2-infected patients and retrospective cohort of hospitalized pneumonia patients between January and June 2019 (overall cohort).\nA, Comparison of statin-treated vs statin-nontreated coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients (adjusted).

COPD indicates chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder.\nThen, the HR of COVID-19 patients and a retrospective cohort of patients hospitalized with pneumonia between January and June 2019 was compared. Importantly, in 2019, there was no viral pneumonia epidemic in Korea, for example, due to severe acute respiratory syndrome or Middle East respiratory syndrome infection. Therefore, the 2019 pneumonia cohort was composed of bacterial and viral pneumonia patients combined. This retrospective cohort included 179 265 patients with a mean age of 39 years, of whom 49.4% were women. The most common comorbidity in the cohort was hypertension (33.3%), followed by COPD (25.1%), diabetes (23.4%), and any cancer (6.9%; Table IV in the Data Supplement). The mortality rate at 60 days was 7.4% and sharply increased among elderly patients (&gt;=60 years); of note, it was even higher than that in the context of COVID-19 (Figure 1B). Moreover, after considering secondary factors, the results of the present study indicated a significantly lower risk of 60-day mortality in the context of the use of statins (HR, 0.519 [95% CI, 0.495-0.544]; P&lt;0.0001; Tables V and VI in the Data Supplement both in the overall cohort and the 1:2 PSM). Of note, the HR values were comparable between COVID-19 patients and the retrospective cohort of patients hospitalized with pneumonia (2019) in Korea, in the context of the use of statins (P=0.3244 in the overall cohort, P=0.7162 in the 2:1 PSM; Table VIII in the Data Supplement).\nDiscussion\nIn the present study, we showed that statins are not associated with COVID-19-related fatal outcomes. In fact, the use of statins correlated with significantly lower mortality in COVID-19 patients (by 36%).\nHigher event rates in elderly patients with comorbidities are a common finding reported previously. Of note, in this study, patients with comorbidities were much older than those without comorbidities. For example, the mean age of hypertensive patients was &gt;20 years older than that of nonhypertensive patients. In fact, after adjusting for secondary factors such as age and sex, our results revealed that the association between comorbidities and mortality was much reduced. However, still, patients with hypertension, diabetes, chronic kidney disease, or heart failure showed higher mortality compared with those without comorbidities.\nThe most important finding of our study was that prior use of statins was significantly associated with lower mortality in COVID-19 patients. There are a few recently published studies investigating the effect of the use of statins on COVID-19, showing results consistent with those in our study. Moreover, this finding was consistent with previous meta-analyses in pneumonia patients and also with pneumonia patients in Korea, in 2019, evaluated in this study. Lastly, this protective effect was supported by the potential inhibitory effect in the context of the SARS-CoV-2 main protease:a key coronavirus enzyme. In spite of the controversy regarding the role ACE2, the detailed effect of statins has not been comprehensively evaluated. As a result, the prescription of statins was reportedly reduced during the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States. The concern is that the use of statins in COVID-19 patients may be further reduced due to possible drug interaction with antiviral/antibacterial agents and lower cholesterol levels in the acute stress condition. However, our findings suggested that statins need not be discontinued during the COVID-19 treatment.\nThe current study has several limitations. First, data related to drug exposure were measured based on the claims data. Hence, detailed information about drug exposure, such as adherence to the medication or discontinuation during COVID-19 hospitalization, remains unknown. Second, the follow-up duration of the study was limited to a short period of time. However, most outcomes (86%) occurred within 2 weeks of the COVID-19 treatment. Third, although we evaluated a total of 10 448 COVID-19 patients who were hospitalized in Korea from January 19, 2020, through April 15, 2020, the interpretation of our findings is influenced by the limited sample size. To overcome this limitation, we compared the results with those obtained with a retrospective cohort of &gt;170 000 pneumonia patients hospitalized from January to June 2019. The results indicated similar trends in COVID-19 and pneumonia cases. Lastly, although we performed PSM and multivariate analyses, there might be still a healthy user bias, for example, due to the healthy adherer effect or selective prescribing, potentially influencing the association between the use of statins and lower mortality in COVID-19 patients. The healthy adherer effect might affect the observational study result, which reported that patients who showed complete compliance to antihypertensive medication regardless of either calcium channel blockers or angiotensin II receptor blockers had a lower risk of COVID-19. Therefore, we cannot exclude the possibility that the healthy adherer effect confounded the report's finding.\nConclusions\nStatins were associated with significantly lower mortality of COVID-19, consistent with usual pneumonia patients. Overall, the findings of this article suggest that statins might be considered as a part of the supportive regimen during the treatment of COVID-19. The prospective randomized studies might be warranted to confirm the benefit of statins in COVID-19.\nAcknowledgments\nThis study was supported by the Korean Society of Hypertension and the National Committee for Clinical Management of Emerging Infectious Diseases.

A further search was conducted in Google for relevant literature on 28 March 2020.\nResults\nThere is limited evidence of in vitro activity of CQ/HCQ against SARS-CoV-2. A number of in vivo clinical trials are underway.\n\n The empirical data available from two of these trials reveal conflicting results.\n\n Both trials are characterised by small numbers of participants (n = 30 and n = 36) and suffer methodological limitations.\n\n No medium or long-term follow-up data is available.\n\n\nConclusion\nAt present, there is insufficient evidence to determine whether CQ/HCQ are safe and effective treatments for COVID-19. High quality, adequately powered randomised clinical trials in primary and secondary care settings are urgently required to guide policymakers and clinicians.\n\n These studies should report medium- and long-term follow-up results, and safety data.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7330219","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Royal College of General

PET/CT: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Interventional Studies","abstract":"Aim.\n To evaluate by meta-analysis of interventional studies the effect of statin therapy on arterial wall inflammation.\n Background.\n Arterial exposure to low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels is responsible for initiation and progression of atherosclerosis and arterial wall inflammation.\n 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose Positron Emission Tomography-Computed Tomography (18F-FDG PET/CT) has been used to detect arterial wall inflammation and monitor the vascular anti-inflammatory effects of lipid-lowering therapy.\n Despite a number of statin-based interventional studies exploring 18F-FDG uptake, these trials have produced inconsistent results.\n Methods.\n Trials with at least one statin treatment arm were searched in PubMed-Medline, SCOPUS, ISI Web of Knowledge, and Google Scholar databases.\n Target-to-background ratio (TBR), an indicator of blood-corrected 18F-FDG uptake, was used as the target variable of the statin anti-inflammatory activity.\n Evaluation of studies biases, a random-effects model with generic inverse variance weighting, and sensitivity analysis were performed for qualitative and quantitative data assessment and synthesis.\n Subgroup and meta-regression analyses were also performed.\n Results.\n Meta-analysis of seven eligible studies, comprising 10 treatment arms with 287 subjects showed a significant reduction of TBR following statin treatment (Weighted Mean Difference (WMD): ?0.104, p = 0.002), which was consistent both in high-intensity (WMD: ?0.132, p = 0.019) and low-to-moderate intensity statin trials (WMD: ?0.069, p = 0.037).\n Statin dose/duration, plasma cholesterol and C-reactive protein level changes, and baseline TBR did not affect the TBR treatment response to statins.\n Conclusions.\n Statins were effective in reducing arterial wall inflammation, as assessed by 18F-FDG PET/CT imaging.\n Larger clinical trials should clarify whether either cholesterol-lowering or other pleiotropic mechanisms were responsible for this effect.\n","id":"PMC6352284","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"MDPI","authors":[{"firstname":"Matteo","surname":"Pirro","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Luis

a synthetic universal control ribonucleic acid (uncRNA) containing all of the assays’ target regions on one RNA strand and spiked human blood or urine with known quantities of African or Asian Zika virus strains.\n\n Viral loads in 33 samples from Zika virus-infected patients were determined by using one of the new assays.\n\n\nFindings\nOligonucleotides of the published real-time RT–PCR assays, showed up to 10 potential mismatches with the Asian lineage causing the current outbreak, compared with 0 to 4 mismatches for the new assays.\n\n The 95% lower detection limit of the seven most sensitive assays ranged from 2.1 to 12.1 uncRNA copies/reaction.\n\n Two assays had lower sensitivities of 17.0 and 1373.3 uncRNA copies/reaction and showed a similar sensitivity when using spiked samples.\n\n The mean viral loads in samples from Zika virus-infected patients were 5?×?104 RNA copies/mL of blood and 2?×?104 RNA copies/mL of urine.\n\n\nConclusion\nWe provide reagents and updated

Replication of the resulting viruses was compared in primate cell cultures as well as Rhinolophus bat cells made permissive for SARS-CoV replication by lentiviral transduction of the human

and Sources of Endemic Human Coronaviruses","abstract":"The four endemic human coronaviruses HCoV-229E, -NL63, -OC43, and -HKU1 contribute a considerable share of upper and lower respiratory tract infections in adults and children.\n While their clinical representation resembles that of many other agents of the common cold, their evolutionary histories, and host associations could provide important insights into the natural history of past human pandemics.\n For two of these viruses, we have strong evidence suggesting an origin in major livestock species while primordial associations for all four viruses may have existed with bats and rodents.\n HCoV-NL63 and -229E may originate from bat reservoirs as assumed for many other coronaviruses, but HCoV-OC43 and -HKU1 seem more likely to have speciated from rodent-associated viruses.\n HCoV-OC43 is thought to have emerged from ancestors in domestic animals such as cattle or swine.\n The bovine coronavirus has been suggested to be a possible ancestor, from which HCoV-OC43 may have emerged in the context of a pandemic recorded historically at the end of the 19th century.\n New data suggest that HCoV-229E may actually be transferred from dromedary camels similar to Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus.\n This scenario provides important ecological parallels to the present prepandemic pattern of host associations of the MERS coronavirus.\n","id":"PMC7112090","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Elsevier Inc.","authors":[{"firstname":"Victor

to the need for a coordinated and readily accessible collection of viruses that could be made available to academia, public health organisations and industry.\n Within three years, it developed from a consortium of nine European laboratories to encompass associated partners in Africa, Russia, China, Turkey, Germany and Italy.\n In 2014, the H2020 Research and Innovation Framework Programme (INFRAS projects) provided support for the transformation of the EVA from a European to a global organization (EVAg).\n The EVAg now operates as a non-profit consortium, with 26 partners and 20 associated partners from 21 EU and non-EU countries.\n In this paper, we outline the structure, management and goals of the EVAg, to bring to the attention of researchers the wealth of products it can provide

However, statins may increase the risk of SARS-CoV-2 viral entry by inducing ACE2 expression.\n Here, we performed a retrospective study on 13,981 patients with COVID-19 in Hubei Province, China, among which 1,219 received statins.\n Based on a mixed-effect Cox model after propensity score-matching, we found that the risk for 28-day all-cause mortality was 5.2% and 9.4% in the matched statin and non-statin groups, respectively, with an adjusted hazard ratio of 0.58. The statin use-associated lower risk of mortality was also observed in the Cox time-varying model and marginal structural model analysis.\n These results give support for the completion of ongoing prospective studies and randomized controlled trials involving statin treatment for COVID-19, which are needed to further validate the utility of this class of drugs to combat the mortality of this pandemic.\n","id":"PMC7311917","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Elsevier Inc.","authors":[{"firstname":"Xiao-Jing","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Juan-Juan","surname":"Qin","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Xu","surname":"Cheng","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lijun","surname":"Shen","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Yan-Ci","surname":"Zhao","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Yufeng","surname":"Yuan","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Fang","surname":"Lei","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Ming-Ming","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Huilin","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Liangjie","surname":"Bai","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Xiaohui","surname":"Song","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Lijin","surname":"Lin","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Meng","surname":"Xia","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Feng","surname":"Zhou","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Jianghua","surname":"Zhou","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Zhi-Gang","surname":"She","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Lihua","surname":"Zhu","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Xinliang","surname":"Ma","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Qingbo","surname":"Xu","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Ping","surname":"Ye","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Guohua","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Liming","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Weiming","surname":"Mao","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Youqin","surname":"Yan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Bing","surname":"Xiao","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Zhigang","surname":"Lu","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Gang","surname":"Peng","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Mingyu","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Jun","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Luyu","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Changjiang","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Haofeng","surname":"Lu","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Xigang","surname":"Xia","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Daihong","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Xiaofeng","surname":"Liao","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Xiang","surname":"Wei","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Bing-Hong","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Xin","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Juan","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Guang-Nian","surname":"Zhao","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Peng","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Peter P.","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Rohit","surname":"Loomba","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Yan-Xiao","surname":"Ji","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Jiahong","surname":"Xia","email":"jiahong.xia@hust.edu.cn","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Yibin","surname":"Wang","email":"yibinwang@mednet.ucla.edu","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Jingjing","surname":"Cai","email":"caijingjing83@hotmail.com","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Jiao","surname":"Guo","email":"guoj@gdpu.edu.cn","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Hongliang","surname":"Li","email":"lihl@whu.edu.cn","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Atorvastatin associated with decreased hazard for death in COVID-19 patients admitted to an ICU: a retrospective cohort study","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Risk Factors Associated With Mortality Among Patients With COVID-19 in Intensive Care Units in Lombardy, Italy","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Wells G, Shea B, O'Connell D, Peterson J, Welch V, Losos M, Tugwell P.

Demographic data, symptoms, laboratory values, comorbidities, treatments, and clinical outcomes were all collected.\n\n Data were compared between survivors and non-survivors.\n\n The primary outcome was 28-day mortality, as of Feb 9, 2020. Secondary outcomes included incidence of SARS-CoV-2-related acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and the proportion of patients requiring mechanical ventilation.\n\n\nFindings\nOf 710 patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, 52 critically ill adult patients were included.\n\n The mean age of the 52 patients was 59·7 (SD 13·3) years, 35 (67%) were men, 21 (40%) had chronic illness, 51 (98%) had fever.\n\n 32 (61·5%) patients had died at 28 days, and the median duration from admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) to death was 7 (IQR 3–11) days for non-survivors.\n\n Compared with survivors, non-survivors were older (64·6 years [11·2] vs 51·9 years [12·9]), more likely to develop ARDS (26 [81%] patients vs 9 [45%] patients), and more likely to receive mechanical ventilation (30 [94%] patients vs 7 [35%] patients), either invasively or non-invasively.\n\n Most patients had organ function damage, including 35 (67%) with ARDS, 15 (29%) with acute kidney injury, 12 (23%) with cardiac injury, 15 (29%) with liver dysfunction, and one (2%) with pneumothorax.\n\n 37 (71%) patients required mechanical ventilation.\n\n Hospital-acquired infection occurred in seven (13·5%) patients.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe mortality of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia is considerable.\n\n The survival time of the non-survivors is likely to be within 1–2 weeks after ICU admission.\n\n Older patients (&gt;65 years) with comorbidities and ARDS are at increased risk of death.\n\n The severity of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia poses great strain on critical care resources in

Hydroxychloroquine for the Treatment of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)","abstract":"Background\nThe Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) first broke out in Wuhan (China) and subsequently spread worldwide.\n\n Chloroquine has been sporadically used in treating SARS-CoV-2 infection.\n\n Hydroxychloroquine shares the same mechanism of action as chloroquine, but its more tolerable safety profile makes it the preferred drug to treat malaria and autoimmune conditions.\n\n We propose that the immunomodulatory effect of hydroxychloroquine also may be useful in controlling the cytokine storm that occurs late-phase in critically ill SARS-CoV-2 infected patients.\n\n Currently, there is no evidence to support the use of hydroxychloroquine in SARS-CoV-2 infection.\n\n\nMethods\nThe pharmacological activity of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine was tested using SARS-CoV-2 infected Vero cells.\n\n Physiologically-based pharmacokinetic models (PBPK) were implemented for both drugs separately by integrating their in vitro data.\n\n Using the PBPK models, hydroxychloroquine concentrations in lung fluid were simulated under 5 different dosing regimens to explore the most effective regimen whilst considering the drug’s safety profile.\n\n\nResults\nHydroxychloroquine (EC50=0.72 ?M) was found to be more potent than chloroquine (EC50=5.47 ?M) in vitro.\n\n Based on PBPK models results, a loading dose of 400 mg twice daily of hydroxychloroquine sulfate given orally, followed by a maintenance dose of 200 mg given twice daily for 4 days is recommended for SARS-CoV-2 infection, as it reached three times the potency of chloroquine phosphate when given 500 mg twice daily 5 days in advance.\n\n\nConclusions\nHydroxychloroquine was found to be more potent than chloroquine to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7108130","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Oxford University

caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).\n\n Epidemiological and clinical characteristics of patients with COVID-19 have been reported but risk factors for mortality and a detailed clinical course of illness, including viral shedding, have not been well described.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this retrospective, multicentre cohort study, we included all adult inpatients (?18 years old) with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 from Jinyintan Hospital and Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital (Wuhan, China) who had been discharged or had died by Jan 31, 2020. Demographic, clinical, treatment, and laboratory data, including serial samples for viral RNA detection, were extracted from electronic medical records and compared between survivors and non-survivors.\n\n We used univariable and multivariable logistic regression methods to explore the risk factors associated with in-hospital death.\n\n\nFindings\n191 patients (135 from Jinyintan Hospital and 56 from Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital) were included in this study, of whom 137 were discharged and 54 died in hospital.\n\n 91 (48%) patients had a comorbidity, with hypertension being the most common (58 [30%] patients), followed by diabetes (36 [19%] patients) and coronary heart disease (15 [8%] patients).\n\n Multivariable regression showed increasing odds of in-hospital death associated with older age (odds ratio 1·10, 95% CI 1·03–1·17, per year increase; p=0·0043), higher Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score (5·65, 2·61–12·23; p&lt;0·0001), and d-dimer greater than 1 ?g/mL (18·42, 2·64–128·55; p=0·0033) on admission.\n\n Median duration of viral shedding was 20·0 days (IQR 17·0–24·0) in survivors, but SARS-CoV-2 was detectable until death in non-survivors.\n\n The longest observed duration of viral shedding in survivors was 37 days.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe potential risk factors of older age, high SOFA score, and d-dimer greater than 1 ?g/mL could help clinicians to identify patients with poor prognosis at an early stage.\n\n Prolonged viral shedding provides the rationale for a strategy of isolation of infected patients and optimal antiviral interventions in the future.\n\n\nFunding\nChinese Academy of Medical Sciences Innovation Fund for Medical Sciences; National Science Grant for Distinguished Young Scholars; National Key

Trial of Lopinavir–Ritonavir in Adults Hospitalized with Severe Covid-19","abstract":"Background\nNo therapeutics have yet been proven effective for the treatment of severe illness caused by SARS-CoV-2.\nMethods\nWe conducted a randomized, controlled, open-label trial involving hospitalized adult patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, which causes the respiratory illness Covid-19, and an oxygen saturation (Sao2) of 94% or less while they were breathing ambient air or a ratio of the partial pressure of oxygen (Pao2) to the fraction of inspired oxygen (Fio2) of less than 300 mm Hg.\n\n Patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either lopinavir–ritonavir (400 mg and 100 mg, respectively) twice a day for 14 days, in addition to standard care, or standard care alone.\n\n The primary end point was the time to clinical improvement, defined as the time from randomization to either an improvement of two points on a seven-category ordinal scale or discharge from the hospital, whichever came first.\n\n\nResults\nA total of 199 patients with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection underwent randomization; 99 were assigned to the lopinavir–ritonavir group, and 100 to the standard-care group.\n\n Treatment with lopinavir–ritonavir was not associated with a difference from standard care in the time to clinical improvement (hazard ratio for clinical improvement, 1.24; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.90 to 1.72).\n\n Mortality at 28 days was similar in the lopinavir–ritonavir group and the standard-care group (19.2% vs.\n\n 25.0%; difference, ?5.8 percentage points; 95% CI, ?17.3 to 5.7).\n\n The percentages of patients with detectable viral RNA at various time points were similar.\n\n In a modified intention-to-treat analysis, lopinavir–ritonavir led to a median time to clinical improvement that was shorter by 1 day than that observed with standard care (hazard ratio, 1.39; 95% CI, 1.00 to 1.91).\n\n Gastrointestinal adverse events were more common in the lopinavir–ritonavir group, but serious adverse events were more common in the standard-care group.\n\n Lopinavir–ritonavir treatment was stopped early in 13 patients (13.8%) because of adverse events.\n\n\nConclusions\nIn hospitalized adult patients with severe Covid-19, no benefit was observed with lopinavir–ritonavir treatment beyond standard care.\n\n Future trials in patients with severe illness may help to confirm or exclude the possibility of a treatment benefit.\n\n (Funded by Major Projects of National Science and Technology on New Drug

patients\nBackground\nThe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection has profoundly affected the lives of millions of

Since the outbreak in December 2019, a considerable number of people has suffered from a severe acute respiratory infection that causes respiratory failure, the need for intubation, and prolonged mechanical ventilation. Currently, the management of COVID-19 remains mostly supportive and depends on the severity of the disease, ranging from no support in asymptomatic patients to intubation and mechanical ventilation to manage acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in severe cases. During the early stages of the pandemic, it was theorized that respiratory failure in COVID-19 may differ from typical ARDS. These differences include the presence of good lung compliance, lack of pulmonary vasoconstriction, significant shunting and poor oxygenation, and concomitant features of thrombotic microangiopathy with endothelial dysfunction.\nApart from respiratory symptoms, most patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 have an increased risk of cardiovascular complications and thromboembolism, causing cerebrovascular events, deep vein thrombosis, or pulmonary embolism, further complicating the post-infection course. Patients suffering from COVID-19 frequently present with multi-morbidity (i.e., co-existence of multiple co-morbidities), including hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes. A retrospective analysis of 72,314 COVID-19 cases from China showed that patients with cardiovascular diseases exhibited significantly higher mortality (10.5% vs. 2.3%). The use of statins has been associated with a marked reduction in the risk of death from cardiovascular disease in the general population. Therefore, it has been proposed that statins through their pleiotropic modes of action, which include improvement of endothelial function, and anti-inflammatory and antithrombotic effects, may therapeutically benefit COVID-19 patients. A recent retrospective investigation on 13,981 patients with COVID-19 (Hubei Province, China), of which 1219 patients received statins, revealed that statin use was associated with reduced mortality.\nStatins are conventionally used as cholesterol-lowering drugs, via inhibition of the mevalonate pathway, for first-line therapeutic prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases. The discovery of their pleiotropic effects, independent of the cholesterol pathway, further attracted attention to this class of drugs. The decreased mortality rate from cardiovascular diseases following statin consumption was attributed to both the lipid-lowering effect and enhancement of vascular endothelial function. The latter statin-effect has also been observed in other patient populations, including diabetics and women with polycystic ovary syndrome. Various mechanisms have been reported for the statin-mediated improvement of endothelial function and include reducing remnant lipoproteins, modulating the high mobility group box 1/toll-like receptor 4(HMGB1/TLR4) pathway, inhibiting miR-133a expression, inducing nitric oxide release, affecting Kruppel-like factor 2 signaling, and decreasing the level of acute-phase proteins (like C-reactive protein); of note, this last mechanism is also involved in the anti-inflammatory effects of statins. Due to their anti-inflammatory properties, statins showed beneficial effects in hypertensive patients with normal cholesterol levels. Several studies have identified the activation of autophagy as one of the primary molecular mechanisms underpinning the anti-inflammatory effects of statins.\nIn the current retrospective study, we investigated whether statin use is associated with improved survival and clinical outcome in COVID-19 patients who were hospitalized in the Ali Asghar Hospital, Iran.\nMethods\nPatient recruitment\nFlow-chart of patient enrolment and summary of the inclusion and exclusion criteria. HR: Hazard Ratio; P: P-value; P S: Propensity Score; In PS: Invers Propensity Score\nThis was a retrospective study involving a population of COVID-19 patients (ethics approval: IR.SUMS.REC.1399.151, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences) treated in a single tertiary hospital in Shiraz, Iran (ALIASGHAR Hospital), between March 1st and May 30th, 2020. We specifically focused on those patients who were discharged or had died by the end of May 2020 (Fig. 1). Hospitalized patients with the following inclusion criteria were evaluated: COVID-19 pneumonia confirmed as per WHO criteria, including a positive SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test of respiratory (nasopharynx, oropharynx) specimens, and evidenced by chest X-ray or chest computed tomography (CT) scan. The CT images were reviewed by an expert radiologist who was blind to the clinical information. Each CT scan was scrutinized for the presence of important radiologic features, including ground-glass opacity (GGO), consolidation, pleural effusion, septal thickening, and lymphadenopathy. The Radiological Society of North America Expert Consensus guidelines were implemented for the diagnosis of positive cases. The peripheral bilateral GGOs, GGOs of rounded morphology, reverse halo sign, and other indications of organizing pneumonia were regarded as typical for COVID-19 pneumonia. A radiologic severity score was applied in case of abnormal chest CT findings. Patients were also required to meet the following oxygenation inclusion criteria: SPO2 &lt;= 93% or PaO2/FiO2 &lt; 300 mmHg &lt; 300 mmHg. The exclusion criteria were: HIV, hepatitis B or C, influenza virus, or active tuberculosis infection; suspected active bacterial, fungal, or any other infections besides COVID-19; age &lt; 19 and &gt; 85 years old. In addition, patients with autoimmune or neoplastic diseases were excluded as they were using immune-modulators and/or anti-inflammatory medications or participated in drug clinical trials. \nInitially, a total of 459 patients were considered eligible for inclusion. Of these patients, 34 were excluded in the primary screening since they did not meet the age criteria (Fig. 1). During the first phase of our investigation, 48 patients were transferred to other hospitals and excluded from the study because of the inability to follow-up. An additional 227 patients were excluded because important aspects of their medical records were missing (Fig. 1). Ultimately, a total of 150 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients were included in this study, of which 75 had a history of statin therapy and still used statin at the time of hospitalization. Patients using statins were matched with those that did not according to specific confounders, such as duration of the disease, COVID-19 medication, stage of the disease, history of the underlying disease, and age. Demographic, clinical treatment, and laboratory data (including serial samples for viral RNA detection) were extracted from the electronic medical records. All data were checked by the physicians and a researcher adjudicating any differences in the interpretation by the primary radiologists. After data collection, univariable logistic regression was performed to screen for predictors, after which multivariable logistic regression was conducted to evaluate the effects of statin therapy and other predictors on patient recovery.\nStatistical analysis\nCox proportional-hazards regression models were used to estimate the association between statin use and risk of death. The proportional hazard (PH) assumption was checked for all predictors with the Schoenfeld residuals analysis test before model building. The PH assumption is very important to Cox regression; it means that the ratio of the hazards for any two individuals is constant over time. For example, if gender is one of the predictors in the Cox model and the hazard of death for men is twice as high as for women, this must be constant over time. It dictates that time-varying predictors cannot enter the PH Cox model.\nFirst, univariate Cox regression was conducted for each predictor. Variables that had a significant association with the hazard of death in this analysis were subsequently entered into the multivariate Cox regression.\nTo adjust for the effects of confounders and estimate the pure association between statin consumption and time until death, we implemented four strategies: multivariate Cox regression, Weighted PH Cox, PH Cox after propensity score matching, and PH Cox adjusted with propensity score. In our study, individual matching was very difficult or even impossible because protecting the patient's life is a priority and all physicians want to prevent their patients from dying; therefore, physicians often prescribe several antibiotics and antivirals simultaneously. Consequently, there were several confounders, such as drugs and clinical-, laboratory-, and CT- characteristics.\nA confounder is a variable that simultaneously has an association with the exposure and the outcome. In the statistical analysis of observational data, there is no randomization of the participants in treatment groups. Therefore, the participant populations are not homogeneous based on their characteristics and clinical variables. For example, in our study, patients in the statin and non-statin groups were not subjected to the exact same amount or type of antivirals, antibiotics and/or other drugs. Multiple drug-related, laboratory, and characteristic variables were different between these groups; such heterogeneous variables led to the bias estimation of the statin effect.\nWe used propensity score methods to minimize the effects of confounding factors. The propensity score analysis is a statistical technique that estimates the pure effect of treatment and removes or reduces the effect of other confounding variables. By using this method, the effects of all confounding variables are summarized into a score (the propensity score). The individual propensities were estimated with the use of a multivariable logistic regression model that included all confounding covariates; statin use was considered the outcome in this approach.\nWe performed three adjustment procedures with respect to the propensity score. First, the individual propensity scores were inversed to calculate the inverse propensity score weights. Analysis using the Weighted Cox regression model was subsequently conducted with these weights (Weighted PH Cox with inverse propensity score as weight). Second, since each individual has a propensity score, subjects from the two groups (statin vs no statin) could be matched based on their scores. In the propensity score matching analysis, the nearest-neighbor method was applied to create the best matches (PH Cox after propensity score matching). In the third adjustment procedure, the propensity score was entered in the multivariate Cox regression as an additional covariate (PH Cox adjusted with propensity score). For the secondary analysis, we used logistic regression and the outcome was changed to CT result and mechanical ventilation. Multiple imputations were used to handle the missing data. All statistical analyses were performed using R software, version 4.02 (R Project for Statistical Computing).\nResults\nFor the 150 recruited participants with COVID-19 that met the inclusion criteria, the mean duration of hospitalization was 6.84 +- 4.35 days. The majority of patients was retired (29.7%) and/or stayed occupied doing housework (31.8%). The mean age and BMI were 54.69 +- 4.35 years and 26.27 +- 3.68, respectively. Follow-up with these patients started at admission and continued for 27 days. Over this period, 19 patients died from COVID19, whereas the other 131 patients recovered and were discharged from the hospital. Three different types of statin were used among the 75 patients on statins: atorvastatin (94.7%), rosuvastatin (2.7%), and simvastatin (2.7%). In the statin group, 14% of patients had been using statins for over 5 years, 22% for 1-5 years, and the remaining 64% for less than 1 year before hospital admission. The mean time of statin use during hospitalization was 7.37 +- 4.84 (SD) days.\nCharacteristics and comparison of patient groups (statin vs no statin), before and after propensity score matching\nParameters	Unmatched	Matched	 	Characteristics variables	Statin (75 patients)	No statin (75 patients)	P-value	Statin (75 patients)	No statin (75 patients)	P-value	 	Age [years]	65.61 +- 13.22	58.77 +- 16.01	&lt; 0.001	63.59 +- 13.18	61.72 +- 15.83	0.433	 	BMI	25.92 +- 4.02	26.61 +- 3.26	0.270	25.81 +- 3.91	25.46 +- 3.16	0.545	 	Gender, n (%)	 	 Male, n (%)	47 (62.7)	40 (53.3)	0.247	45 (60)	43 (57.3)	0.740	 	 Female, n (%)	28 (37.3)	35 (46.7)	30 (40)	32 (42.7)	 	 Addiction status, n (%)	14 (18.7)	1 (1.3)	0.001	11 (14.66)	7 (9.33)	0.315	 	Triage vital signs	 	 Heart rate, beats per min	91.04 +- 18.13	94.20 +- 14.56	0.241	91.02 +- 18.11	92.12 +- 11.82	0.660	 	 Respiratory rate, breathes per min	19.56 +- 3.85	19.44 +- 2.45	0.970	19.52 +- 2.31	19.42 +- 2.22	0.746	 	 Systolic blood pressure (mm Hg)	130.61 +- 23.23	124.28 +- 17.17	0.246	129.58 +- 22.19	127.55 +- 11.1	0.448	 	 Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)	78.01 +- 13.23	78.52 +- 11.56	0.841	78.01 +- 12.98	78.08 +- 11.58	0.972	 	 Body temperature ( C)	37.45 +- 1.14	37.41 +- 1.04	0.787	37.31 +- 1.09	37.22 +- 1.02	0.602	 	 Oxygen saturation (SpO2)	87.65 +- 6.52	91.74 +- 4.60	&lt; 0.001	88.92 +- 5.88	90.23 +- 3.82	0.108	 	Sign and symptoms	 	 Chest pain, n (%)	4 (5.3)	8 (10.3)	0.367	6	7	&gt; 0.999	 	 Dyspnea, n (%)	62 (82.7)	49 (65.3)	0.025	58	52	0.268	 	 Cough, n (%)	51 (68)	58 (77.3)	0.309	53	51	0.068	 	 Headache, n (%)	13 (17.3)	19 (25.3)	0.319	15	17	0.690	 	Comorbidities	 	 Hypertension, n (%)	36 (48)	8 (10.7)	&lt; 0.001	31	12	0.001	 	 Diabetes, n (%)	25 (33.3)	7 (9.3)	&lt; 0.001	21	10	0.524	 	 Cardiovascular disease, n (%)	2 (2.7)	0 (0)	&lt; 0.001	2	1	&gt; 0.999	 	 Respiratory disease, n (%)	9 (12)	10 (13.3)	&gt; 0.999	8	9	0.229	 	 Chronic kidney disease, n (%)	19 (25)	6 (8)	0.004	15	8	0.113	 	Laboratory measures	 	 PMN percent (%)	4.99 +- 2.55	4.94 +- 3.04	0.010	4.94 +- 2.31	4.93 +- 2.82	0.981	 	 Lymphocyte count in serum	1.32 +- 0.84	1.79 +- 0.86	0.001	1.38 +- 0.71	1.61 +- 0.74	0.054	 	 Prothrombin time (PT), (s)	35 +- 17.43	15.70 +- 3.34	&lt; 0.001	31.01 +- 11.07	19.36 +- 2.99	&lt; 0.001	 	 International Normalized Ratio (INR)	1.59 +- 0.62	1.54 +- 0.55	0.602	1.58 +- 0.61	1.56 +- 0.45	0.819	 	 C-reactive protein (CRP), (ml/dl)	78 +- 30.34	24.82 +- 21.46	0.112				 	Antibiotics therapy	 	 Vancomycin, n (%)	33 (44)	35 (46.7)	0.743	33	34	0.870	 	 Linezolid, n (%)	31 (41.3)	12 (16)	0.001	28	16	0.031	 	 Ceftriaxone, n (%)	27 (36)	30 (40)	0.614	28	29	0.866	 	 Azithromycin, n (%)	17 (22.7)	21 (28)	0.453	19	20	0.852	 	Antiviral therapy	 	 Ribavirin, n (%)	8 (10.7)	10 (13.3)	0.615	8	9	0.797	 	 Lopinavir/Ritonavir, n (%)	40 (53.3)	36 (48)	0.514	39	37	0.744	 	 Oseltamivir, n (%)	42 (56)	37 (49.3)	0.414	41	38	0.624	 	Other therapy	 	 Hydroxychloroquine, n (%)	67 (89.3)	63 (84)	0.377	65	65	&gt; 0.999	 	 Glucocorticoids, n (%)	10 (13.3)	4 (5.3)	0.092	9	6	0.414	 	 Salbutamol, n (%)	25 (33.3)	15 (20)	0.065	21	18	0.577	 	 Seroflo, n (%)	12 (16)	12 (16)	&gt; 0.999	12	12	&gt; 0.999	 	Respiratory support	 	 Mechanical ventilation, n (%)	30 (40)	16 (21.3)	0.013	27	19	0.464	 	\nBMI body mass index; P-values were calculated by Mann-Whitney U test for non-normally distributed continuous variables and Fisher's exact test or chi2 test for the categorical variables; P-value less than 0.05 was considered significant\nPatients that used statins (40 mg daily) because of hyperlipidemia were older (65.61 vs. 58.77 years of age, P &lt; 0.001) and had a higher prevalence of comorbidities, including hypertension (48% vs. 10.7%, P &lt; 0.001), type 2 diabetes (33.3% vs. 9.3%, P &lt; 0.001), cardiovascular disease (2.7% vs. 0%, P &lt; 0.001), cerebrovascular diseases (10.7% vs. 1.3%, P &lt; 0.001), and chronic kidney diseases (25% vs. 8%, P &lt; 0.001), than those without statin therapy. On average, the statin group exhibited significantly increased leukocyte polymorphonuclear (PMN) percentages (4.99 +- 2.55 vs. 4.94 +- 3.04) and reduced lymphocyte counts (1.32 +- 0.84 vs. 1.79 +- 0.86) as compared to the non-statin group (P = 0.01) (Table 1). \nThe baseline patient characteristics are shown in Table 1, both in the unmatched and propensity score-matched samples. Before matching individuals from the two groups (statin vs non-statin) based on the propensity score, some variables showed different distribution; however, after matching, the majority showed a similar distribution in both groups. In the unmatched samples, statin exposure differed according to age, addiction status, hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, chronic kidney disease, dyspnea, oxygen saturation (SpO2), PMN percentage, lymphocyte count, prothrombin time, linezolid treatment, and mechanical ventilation (at least P &lt; 0.05 for all).\nHistogram and density distribution plots of the estimated propensity scores, before and after propensity score adjustment in statin and non-statin patient groups. The left side of the figure (unadjusted) shows that the non-statin group had more density on the right side of the plot versus the statin group that had more density on the left side of the plot. After adjustment (right side of the figure), both groups displayed similar densities. The results show that the two groups became more similar when considering mutual confounders that may affect the association between the main exposure variable (statins) and survival time. The C-statistic of the propensity score model was 0.75\nThe distribution of the estimated propensity scores among statin and non-statin patients is shown in Fig. 2. As can be clearly observed, the histogram and density distribution of the estimated propensity scores were more balanced after adjustment. This shows that the two groups became more similar when considering mutual confounders that may affect the association between the main exposure variable (statins) and survival time.

This plot suggested that before any adjustment (naive data) the statin group had a lower survival compared to the non-statin group; however, this difference was not statistically significant. (P = 0.16). The proportional hazard (PH) assumption was checked and approved for all the characteristic variables before conducting PH Cox model analyses (not shown). The crude and adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) for the association of characteristic variables on survival time are shown in Table 2. In the crude, unadjusted analysis, patients on statins seemed more likely to have a death event but this did not reach significance [HR = 2.21, 95% CI = (0.71,6.90), P = 0.174]. The variables that showed a significant association in the univariate model (crude) were entered into the multivariate Cox regression model for adjustment purposes. In the multivariate Cox model, only mechanical ventilation had a significant effect on survival. Interestingly, the adjusted HR in the multivariate model that included mechanical ventilation was associated with an apparent lower risk of mortality in COVID19 patients on statins compared to non-statin users [HR = 0.92, 95% CI = (0.21,4.16), P = 0.918]; although a promising observation, this association was not statistically significant. Figure 4 clarifies and highlights the difference between crude and propensity score-adjusted Cox regression plots for patient survival in the statin and non-statin groups. The results of five distinct Cox models with different adjustments are outlined in Table 3. No association was found between statin use and reduced mortality survival in the Cox analysis with inverse propensity score weighting (weighted Cox regression) [HR = 0.94; 95% CI = (0.22, 4.17), P = 0.923]. Based on a Cox model after propensity score matching, the HR for the statin group appeared to be associated with a lower risk of mortality [HR = 0.85, 95% CI = (0.02,3.93), P = 0.762]. Similarly, additional propensity score analysis results (Cox regression with propensity score adjustment, model 5) also revealed that statin use was potentially associated with a decreased hazard of death [(HR = 0.76; 95% CI (0.16, 3.72), P = 0.735)]. Although these associations did not reach statistical significance, they do indicate that statin use might increase survival of COVID19 patients, and that future prospective clinical trials and extensive retrospective studies are warranted to validate the potential therapeutic potential of statins in the amelioration of clinical symptoms and mortality rate associated with COVID19. \nThe results of the crude and propensity score adjusted logistic regression for the secondary outcome\nLogistic regression models	Crude	Adjusted with PS	 	Secondary outcome	OR	95% CI for OR	P-value	OR	95% C.I for OR	P-value	 	CT result (abnormal vs. normal)	1.77	0.61-5.14	0.295	0.41	0.07-2.33	0.312	 	Mechanical ventilation vs. none	2.46	1.19-5.05	0.014	0.96	0.61-2.49	0.942	 	\nOR odds ratio, CI confidence interval, PS propensity score\nAs a secondary outcome, we used logistic regression to analyze the association of statin use with the incidence of invasive mechanical ventilation and abnormal CT results in COVID19 patients. After adjusting with the propensity score, statin consumption was associated with a lower chance of being subjected to mechanical ventilation [OR = 0.96, 95% CI = (0.61-2.99), P = 0.942]. In addition, patients in the statin group appeared less likely to present with abnormal CT results [OR = 0.41, 95% CI = (0.07-2.33), P = 0.312] (Table 4). \nDiscussion\nThe results on statin use and its potential benefits for COVID-19 patients are controversial. In a recent meta-analysis, it was reported that &quot;statin use did not improve in-hospital outcomes of COVID-19 infections&quot;; this analysis included 9 studies with a total of 3449 patients. The results showed that statin use did not improve the outcome severity [OR = 1.64, 95% CI: (0.51-5.23), P = 0.41, I2 = 93%, random-effect modelling] or the mortality rate associated with COVID-19 infection [OR 0.78, 95% CI: (0.50-1.21), p = 0.26, I2 = 0%, fixed-effect modelling]. This finding might be due to the statistical analysis method used. In an investigation on the use of statins in chronic renal disease patients with COVID-19, it was shown that statins reduced &quot;the risk of neutrophilia [OR-0.10, 95% CI: (0.01-0.69)]&quot; but did not affect the mortality in these patients. Conversely, a relatively large retrospective study on 13,981 patients with COVID-19 (Hubei Province, China) revealed that statin use decreased all-cause mortality from 9.4 to 5.2% (a total of 1219 patients received statins). Furthermore, a recent investigation showed that statin use decreased the in-hospital mortality in COVID-19 patients with diabetes. It has also been reported that for patients using statin during hospitalization the risk of ICU admission is reduced when compared to non-statin users, and that statin use decreased the risk of invasive mechanical ventilation in COVID-19 patients.\nBased on our overall results, we feel that there is an indication that the use of statins may be linked to a lower risk of COVID19 mortality, even though this association did not reach statistical significance [HR = 0.924, 95% CI = (0.205, 4.157), P = 0.918]. In addition, statins significantly reduced the need for mechanical ventilation and improved lung CT in COVID-19 patients. Although promising and clinically relevant, our observed associations between statin use and survival of COVID19 patients were not statistically significant (likely due to impaired power of our analysis as a result of the many patients that had to be excluded) and need to be validated in prospective clinical trials and extensive retrospective studies. Considering the various documented pleotropic effects of statins and the results presented here, we anticipate positive effects of statin use on the clinical outcomes of COVID-19 patients. In a recent investigation comprising 3654 individuals in Germany, it was demonstrated that using statins was associated with asymptomatic COVID-19; accordingly, it was postulated that statins might promote SARS-CoV-2 transmission by increasing the number of asymptomatic COVID-19 patients. In contrast, a recent observational multi-center study in Italy indicated that statin use was associated with an increased risk of more severe COVID-19, whereas another recent report suggested that statins did not affect mortality at all in COVID-19 patients (4842 subjects).\nPleiotropic effects of statins have been reported in several malignancies, especially respiratory infections, acute lung injury, pulmonary hypertension, community-acquired pneumonia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and interstitial lung disease. Statins have shown various beneficial anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory properties by affecting intracellular signaling pathways that are independent of their lipid-lowering ability. Furthermore, antiviral effects against the influenza virus have been demonstrated in several in vitro and in vivo studies. Statins modulate the antiviral response in human bronchial and epithelial cells, which constitute the first line of defense against invading pathogens, and significantly reduce the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-  and IL-6, in Crandell feline kidney cells infected with H1N1. In primary normal human bronchial epithelial cells (NHBE) and the human type II pneumocyte cell line A549, simvastatin attenuated viral dsRNA-induced AKT phosphorylation, STAT3 activation, and subsequent production of RANTES. In another study, simvastatin was shown to reduce the replication of H1N1 by blocking RhoA membrane localization, actin filament condensation, Rab protein expression during endocytosis, and LC3-II protein localization.\nThe effects of statins on the Coronaviridae family are still under-studied. Earlier in 2015, it was proposed that a high dose of atorvastatin may work against MERS-CoV infections by decreasing inflammatory cytokines, and that although statins may not be very effective in late-stage patients, timely use could be vital for the survival of MERS-CoV infected subjects. Since some investigations had confirmed the association of statin therapy with a reduction in cardiovascular outcomes and mortality in patients infected with influenza, it was also suggested that COVID19 patients, with severe damage to lung tissue caused by a cytokine storm of inflammatory mediators, continue statin therapy for its potential clinical benefit.\nSeveral studies have provided some more mechanistic perspectives on the action of statins in relation to SARS-CoV-2 infection. An in silico docking study highlighted that statins might be efficient inhibitors of the SARS-CoV-2 main protease. Moreover, selective statins (fluvastatin was more efficient than other statins) reduced SARS-CoV-2 cell entry and inhibited infection of human respiratory epithelial cells in vitro by either the low pathogenic (coronavirus 229E) or highly pathogenic (2019-nCoV) coronavirus. This study also reported that statin therapy did not cause any additional risk to patients and that some statins may have a mild beneficial effect on COVID-19 outcome.\nAutophagy is an important cellular mechanism against different types of stress, including viral infection. SARS-CoV-2 infection likely changes autophagy flux in the infected cells and hijacks it for its replication. The clinical effects of statins described to date have in part been attributed to their impact on cellular autophagy. Indeed, several studies have reported the involvement of the autophagy pathway as a mechanism for the protective effects of statins in the human lung. Using airway mesenchymal cells, we demonstrated the potential for statins to have beneficial effects in obstructive airways diseases by induction of autophagy via upregulation of p53 as well as through their effects on other pathways, such as the unfolded protein response. Using a mouse model of asthma, simvastatin was shown to ameliorate key asthmatic symptoms (airway remodeling and inflammation) in the lungs via autophagy augmentation. Therefore, it is conceivable that statins may target SARS-CoV-2 infection in lung epithelial cells through autophagy(-associated) signaling.\nStatins have shown modulatory effects on angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) expression. Qi and co-workers were the first to study the expression of ACE2 in cardiomyocytes of rats with cardiac hypertrophy and reported a decreased expression of both ACE2 mRNA and protein levels in response to 4 weeks of treatment with 5 mg/kg/day atorvastatin. Later, similar effects on aortic arteries in vascular balloon injured rats treated with the same doses of rosuvastatin for 2 to 4 weeks were demonstrated. However, other studies presented conflicting observations. In a cellular model of vascular smooth muscle cell hypertrophy, atorvastatin recovered the molecular changes induced by TNF-alpha and increased ACE2 mRNA expression. Using a rabbit model of atherosclerosis, an association between atherosclerosis and a reduced level of ACE2 in both renal and cardiac tissue was established; ACE2 levels were replenished following 3 weeks of atorvastatin administration. Since the emergence of the significance of ACE2 expression in diabetes, scientists have focused on the potential role of statins in diabetes. Aguilar and colleagues showed that atorvastatin increased ACE2 mRNA in cardiomyocytes of diabetic cardiomyopathic rats, which was associated with a reduction in fibrosis and hypertrophy of the left ventricles. These effects were attributed to the recovered ratio of ACE/ACE2 rather than an increased level of ACE2. Further studies in diabetic rats confirmed that statin administration increased ACE2 mRNA in cardiac tissue from insulin-controlled groups, although this was not accompanied by significant effects on cardiac fibrosis and reactive oxygen species generation. In our current report, 33% of COVID19 cases that used statins were diabetic. Although diabetes is among the comorbidity factors for COVID-19 mortality, none of the enrolled diabetic COVID19 patients on statins died because of COVID-19 infection.\nOur recent investigations demonstrated that in addition to their anti-inflammatory actions, statins inhibit tissue damage by reducing extracellular matrix synthesis in airway mesenchymal cells. Several studies have shown beneficial effects of statins in the treatment and recovery of patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and implied that statins improve lung function by acting on fibrosis mediators. In addition, statins reduce mortality in these patients and those with interstitial lung disease.\nConclusion\nOverall, we propose that statin use can potentially protect SARS-CoV-2-induced tissue damage and improve lung function in COVID-19 patients via different pleiotropic effects. These effects include targeting the SARS-CoV-2-induced inflammation and cytokine storm, inhibition of cellular trafficking via targeting the autophagy pathway, mediating ACE2 expression, and decreasing extracellular matrix biosynthesis and scar formation in COVID-19 patients. Our current work may have some different results than those reported in the study in China by Zhang et al., likely because of differences in the number (limitation of our current study) and genetic background of the patients involved. Although we could not demonstrate a significant association between statin use and a reduction in COVID19 mortality, our results are promising and clinically relevant and warrant the need for prospective randomized controlled trials and extensive retrospective studies in large and diverse patient populations to further evaluate the potential beneficial therapeutic effects of statin treatment on clinical symptoms and mortality rates associated with COVID-19. We believe that the use of statins could represent a strong adjuvant/adjunct therapeutic strategy in addition to other (antiviral) therapies currently used against COVID-19. The results of our retrospective study provide evidence that using statins (40 mg daily) might render a better clinical outcome for COVID-19 patients. We speculate that long-term usage of statins prior to infection might be most therapeutically effective.\nPublisher's Note\nSpringer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.\nPayam Peymani and Tania Dehesh have equal first co-authorship.\nPooneh Mokarram and Saeid Ghavami have equal senior authorship.\nAuthors' contributions\nPayam Peymani and Tania Dehesh performed the statistical analyses.

pneumonia.\n Deep sequencing analysis of samples from lower respiratory tract revealed a novel coronavirus, called 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).\n Currently there is a rapid global spread.\n World Health Organization declare the disease a pandemic condition.\n The pathologic source of this disease was a new RNA virus from Coronaviridae family, which was named COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2 entry starts with the binding of the spike glycoprotein expressed on the viral envelope to ACE2 on the alveolar surface followed by clathrin-dependent endocytosis of the SARS-CoV-2 and ACE2 complex.\n SARS-CoV-2 enters the cells through endocytosis process, which is possibly facilitated, via a pH dependent endosomal cysteine protease cathepsins.\n Once inside the cells, SARS-CoV-2 exploits the endogenous transcriptional machinery of alveolar cells to replicate and spread through the entire lung.\n Endosomal acidic pH for SARS-CoV-2 processing and internalization is critical.\n After entering the cells, it possibly activates or hijack many intracellular pathways in favor of its replication.\n In the current opinion article, we will explain the possible involvement of unfolded protein response as a cellular stress response to the SARS-CoV-2 infection.\n","id":"PMC7297682","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Elsevier

29th, 2020, WHO).\n The molecular mechanism of virus infection and spread in the body is not yet disclosed, but studies on other betacoronaviruses show that, upon cell infection, these viruses inhibit macroautophagy/autophagy flux and cause the accumulation of autophagosomes.\n No drug has yet been approved for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection; however, preclinical investigations suggested repurposing of several FDA-approved drugs for clinical trials.\n Half of these drugs are modulators of the autophagy pathway.\n Unexpectedly, instead of acting by directly antagonizing the effects of viruses, these drugs appear to function by suppressing autophagy flux.\n Based on the established cross-talk between autophagy and apoptosis, we speculate that over-accumulation of autophagosomes activates an apoptotic pathway that results in apoptotic death of the infected cells and disrupts the virus replication cycle.\n However, administration of the suggested drugs are associated with severe adverse effects due to their off-target accumulation.\n Nanoparticle targeting of autophagy at the sites of interest could be a powerful tool to efficiently overcome SARS-CoV-2 infection while avoiding the common adverse effects of these drugs.\n","id":"PMC7549903","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Taylor &amp;

cluster of pneumonia cases in Wuhan, China, was caused by a novel betacoronavirus, the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).\n\n We report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatment and clinical outcomes of these patients.\n\n\nMethods\nAll patients with suspected 2019-nCoV were admitted to a designated hospital in Wuhan.\n\n We prospectively collected and analysed data on patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection by real-time RT-PCR and next-generation sequencing.\n\n Data were obtained with standardised data collection forms shared by WHO and the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium from electronic medical records.\n\n Researchers also directly communicated with patients or their families to ascertain epidemiological and symptom data.\n\n Outcomes were also compared between patients who had been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and those who had not.\n\n\nFindings\nBy Jan 2, 2020, 41 admitted hospital patients had been identified as having laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection.\n\n Most of the infected patients were men (30 [73%] of 41); less than half had underlying diseases (13 [32%]), including diabetes (eight [20%]), hypertension (six [15%]), and cardiovascular disease (six [15%]).\n\n Median age was 49·0 years (IQR 41·0–58·0).\n\n 27 (66%) of 41 patients had been exposed to Huanan seafood market.\n\n One family cluster was found.\n\n Common symptoms at onset of illness were fever (40 [98%] of 41 patients), cough (31 [76%]), and myalgia or fatigue (18 [44%]); less common symptoms were sputum production (11 [28%] of 39), headache (three [8%] of 38), haemoptysis (two [5%] of 39), and diarrhoea (one [3%] of 38).\n\n Dyspnoea developed in 22 (55%) of 40 patients (median time from illness onset to dyspnoea 8·0 days [IQR 5·0–13·0]).\n\n 26 (63%) of 41 patients had lymphopenia.\n\n All 41 patients had pneumonia with abnormal findings on chest CT.\n\n Complications included acute respiratory distress syndrome (12 [29%]), RNAaemia (six [15%]), acute cardiac injury (five [12%]) and secondary infection (four [10%]).\n\n 13 (32%) patients were admitted to an ICU and six (15%) died.\n\n Compared with non-ICU patients, ICU patients had higher plasma levels of IL2, IL7, IL10, GSCF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNF?.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe 2019-nCoV infection caused clusters of severe respiratory illness similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and was associated with ICU admission and high mortality.\n\n Major gaps in

associated with a novel coronavirus was reported in Wuhan city, Hubei province, China.\n\n Affected patients were geographically linked with a local wet market as a potential source.\n\n No data on person-to-person or nosocomial transmission have been published to date.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this study, we report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, radiological, and microbiological findings of five patients in a family cluster who presented with unexplained pneumonia after returning to Shenzhen, Guangdong province, China, after a visit to Wuhan, and an additional family member who did not travel to Wuhan.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of genetic sequences from these patients were done.\n\n\nFindings\nFrom Jan 10, 2020, we enrolled a family of six patients who travelled to Wuhan from Shenzhen between Dec 29, 2019 and Jan 4, 2020. Of six family members who travelled to Wuhan, five were identified as infected with the novel coronavirus.\n\n Additionally, one family member, who did not travel to Wuhan, became infected with the virus after several days of contact with four of the family members.\n\n None of the family members had contacts with Wuhan markets or animals, although two had visited a Wuhan hospital.\n\n Five family members (aged 36–66 years) presented with fever, upper or lower respiratory tract symptoms, or diarrhoea, or a combination of these 3–6 days after exposure.\n\n They presented to our hospital (The University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen) 6–10 days after symptom onset.\n\n They and one asymptomatic child (aged 10 years) had radiological ground-glass lung opacities.\n\n Older patients (aged &gt;60 years) had more systemic symptoms, extensive radiological ground-glass lung changes, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and increased C-reactive protein and lactate dehydrogenase levels.\n\n The nasopharyngeal or throat swabs of these six patients were negative for known respiratory microbes by point-of-care multiplex RT-PCR, but five patients (four adults and the child) were RT-PCR positive for genes encoding the internal RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and surface Spike protein of this novel coronavirus, which were confirmed by Sanger sequencing.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these five patients' RT-PCR amplicons and two full genomes by next-generation sequencing showed that this is a novel coronavirus, which is closest to the bat severe acute respiatory syndrome (SARS)-related coronaviruses found in Chinese horseshoe bats.\n\n\nInterpretation\nOur findings are consistent with person-to-person transmission of this novel coronavirus in hospital and family settings, and the reports of infected travellers in other geographical regions.\n\n\nFunding\nThe Shaw Foundation Hong Kong, Michael Seak-Kan Tong, Respiratory Viral Research Foundation Limited, Hui

January 2020. We analyzed data on the first 425 confirmed cases in Wuhan to determine the epidemiologic characteristics of NCIP.\n\n\nMethods\nWe collected information on demographic characteristics, exposure history, and illness timelines of laboratory-confirmed cases of NCIP that had been reported by January 22, 2020. We described characteristics of the cases and estimated the key epidemiologic time-delay distributions.\n\n In the early period of exponential growth, we estimated the epidemic doubling time and the basic reproductive number.\n\n\nResults\nAmong the first 425 patients with confirmed NCIP, the median age was 59 years and 56% were male.\n\n The majority of cases (55%) with onset before January 1, 2020, were linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, as compared with 8.6% of the subsequent cases.\n\n The mean incubation period was 5.2 days (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.1 to 7.0), with the 95th percentile of the distribution at 12.5 days.\n\n In its early stages, the epidemic doubled in size every 7.4 days.\n\n With a mean serial interval of 7.5 days (95% CI, 5.3 to 19), the basic reproductive number was estimated to be 2.2 (95% CI, 1.4 to 3.9).\n\n\nConclusions\nOn the basis of this information, there is evidence that human-to-human transmission has occurred among close contacts since the middle of December 2019.

mortality in critical illness: an observational cohort study","abstract":"Introduction\nThe neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) is a biological marker that has been shown to be associated with outcomes in patients with a number of different malignancies.\n\n The objective of this study was to assess the relationship between NLR and mortality in a population of adult critically ill patients.\n\n\nMethods\nWe performed an observational cohort study of unselected intensive care unit (ICU) patients based on records in a large clinical database.\n\n We computed individual patient NLR and categorized patients by quartile of this ratio.\n\n The association of NLR quartiles and 28-day mortality was assessed using multivariable logistic regression.\n\n Secondary outcomes included mortality in the ICU, in-hospital mortality and 1-year mortality.\n\n An a priori subgroup analysis of patients with versus without sepsis was performed to assess any differences in the relationship between the NLR and outcomes in these cohorts.\n\n\nResults\nA total of 5,056 patients were included.\n\n Their 28-day mortality rate was 19%.\n\n The median age of the cohort was 65 years, and 47% were female.\n\n The median NLR for the entire cohort was 8.9 (interquartile range, 4.99 to 16.21).\n\n Following multivariable adjustments, there was a stepwise increase in mortality with increasing quartiles of NLR (first quartile: reference category; second quartile odds ratio (OR) = 1.32; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.03 to 1.71; third quartile OR = 1.43; 95% CI, 1.12 to 1.83; 4th quartile OR = 1.71; 95% CI, 1.35 to 2.16).\n\n A similar stepwise relationship was identified in the subgroup of patients who presented without sepsis.\n\n The NLR was not associated with 28-day mortality in patients with sepsis.\n\n Increasing quartile of NLR was statistically significantly associated with secondary outcome.\n\n\nConclusion\nThe NLR is associated with outcomes in unselected critically ill patients.\n\n In patients with sepsis, there was no statistically significant relationship between NLR and mortality.\n\n Further investigation is required to increase understanding of the pathophysiology of this relationship and to validate these findings with data collected prospectively.\n\n\nElectronic supplementary material\nThe online version of this article

a major threat to public health1–3.\n Despite intense research efforts, how, when and where new diseases appear are still a source of considerable uncertainty.\n A severe respiratory disease was recently reported in Wuhan, Hubei province, China.\n As of 25 January 2020, at least 1,975 cases had been reported since the first patient was hospitalized on 12 December 2019. Epidemiological investigations have suggested that the outbreak was associated with a seafood market in Wuhan.\n Here we study a single patient who was a worker at the market and who was admitted to the Central Hospital of Wuhan on 26 December 2019 while experiencing a severe respiratory syndrome that included fever, dizziness and a cough.\n Metagenomic RNA sequencing4 of a sample of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from the patient identified a new RNA virus strain from the family Coronaviridae, which is designated here ‘WH-Human 1’ coronavirus (and has also been referred to as ‘2019-nCoV’).\n Phylogenetic analysis of the complete viral genome (29,903 nucleotides) revealed that the virus was most closely related (89.1% nucleotide similarity) to a group of SARS-like coronaviruses (genus Betacoronavirus, subgenus Sarbecovirus) that had previously been found in bats in China5.\n This outbreak highlights the ongoing ability of viral spill-over from animals to cause

inversely with overall survival were recently reported in Chinese cohort studies.\n Critically however, ethnicity has major effects on thrombotic risk, with a 3–4?fold lower risk in Chinese compared to Caucasians and a significantly higher risk in African?Americans.\n In this study, we investigated COVID19 coagulopathy in Caucasian patients.\n Our findings confirm that severe COVID19 infection is associated with a significant coagulopathy that correlates with disease severity.\n Importantly however, Caucasian COVID19 patients on low molecular weight heparin thromboprophylaxis rarely develop overt disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC).\n In rare COVID19 cases where DIC does develop, it tends to be restricted to late?stage disease.\n Collectively, these data suggest that the diffuse bilateral pulmonary inflammation observed in COVID19 is associated with a novel pulmonary?specific vasculopathy termed pulmonary intravascular coagulopathy (PIC) as distinct to DIC.\n Given that thrombotic risk is significantly impacted by race, coupled with the accumulating evidence that coagulopathy is important in COVID19 pathogenesis, our findings raise the intriguing possibility that pulmonary vasculopathy may contribute to the unexplained differences that are beginning to emerge highlighting racial susceptibility to COVID19

diffuse intravascular coagulation.\n\n Reports on the incidence of thrombotic complications are however not available.\n\n\nMethods\nWe evaluated the incidence of the composite outcome of symptomatic acute pulmonary embolism (PE), deep-vein thrombosis, ischemic stroke, myocardial infarction or systemic arterial embolism in all COVID-19 patients admitted to the ICU of 2 Dutch university hospitals and 1 Dutch teaching hospital.\n\n\nResults\nWe studied 184 ICU patients with proven COVID-19 pneumonia of whom 23 died (13%), 22 were discharged alive (12%) and 139 (76%) were still on the ICU on April 5th 2020. All patients received at least standard doses thromboprophylaxis.\n\n The cumulative incidence of the composite outcome was 31% (95%CI 20-41), of which CTPA and/or ultrasonography confirmed VTE in 27% (95%CI 17-37%) and arterial thrombotic events in 3.7% (95%CI 0-8.2%).\n\n PE was the most frequent thrombotic complication (n = 25, 81%).\n\n Age (adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) 1.05/per year, 95%CI 1.004-1.01) and coagulopathy, defined as spontaneous prolongation of the prothrombin time &gt; 3 s or activated partial thromboplastin time &gt; 5 s (aHR 4.1, 95%CI 1.9-9.1), were independent predictors of thrombotic complications.\n\n\nConclusion\nThe 31% incidence of thrombotic complications in ICU patients with COVID-19 infections is remarkably high.\n\n Our findings reinforce the recommendation to strictly apply pharmacological thrombosis prophylaxis in all COVID-19 patients admitted to the ICU, and are strongly suggestive of increasing the prophylaxis towards high-prophylactic doses, even in the absence of randomized evidence.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7146714","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Published by Elsevier

the risk of coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) has not been well studied.\n\n\nMethods\nWe carried out a population-based case–control study in the Lombardy region of Italy.\n\n A total of 6272 case patients in whom infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was confirmed between February 21 and March 11, 2020, were matched to 30,759 beneficiaries of the Regional Health Service (controls) according to sex, age, and municipality of residence.\n\n Information about the use of selected drugs and patients’ clinical profiles was obtained from regional databases of health care use.\n\n Odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals for associations between drugs and infection, with adjustment for confounders, were estimated by means of logistic

aroused regarding a potential harmful effect of angiotensin-converting–enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin-receptor blockers (ARBs) in this clinical context.\n\n\nMethods\nUsing an observational database from 169 hospitals in Asia, Europe, and North America, we evaluated the relationship of cardiovascular disease and drug therapy with in-hospital death among hospitalized patients with Covid-19 who were admitted between December 20, 2019, and March 15, 2020, and were recorded in the Surgical Outcomes Collaborative registry as having either died in the hospital or survived to discharge as of March 28, 2020.\nResults\nOf the 8910 patients with Covid-19 for whom discharge status was available at the time of the analysis, a total of 515 died in the hospital (5.8%) and 8395 survived to discharge.\n\n The factors we found to be independently associated with an increased risk of in-hospital death were an age greater than 65 years (mortality of 10.0%, vs.\n\n 4.9% among

Clinical Outcomes of COVID-19 Infection Among Nursing Home Residents","abstract":"Objectives\nAngiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi), angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs), and HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (“statins”) have been hypothesized to affect COVID-19 severity.\n\n However, up to now, no studies investigating this association have been conducted in the most vulnerable and affected population groups (ie, older adults residing in nursing homes).\n\n The objective of this study was to explore the association of ACEi/ARB and/or statins with clinical manifestations in COVID-19–infected older adults residing in nursing homes.\n\n\nDesign\nWe undertook a retrospective multicenter cohort study to analyze the association between ACEi/ARB and/or statin use with clinical outcome of COVID-19. The outcomes were (1) serious COVID-19 defined as long-stay hospital admission or death within 14 days of disease onset, and (2) asymptomatic (ie, no disease symptoms in the whole study period while still being diagnosed by polymerase chain reaction).\n\n\nSetting and participants\nA total of 154 COVID-19–positive subjects were identified, residing in 1 of 2 Belgian nursing homes that experienced similar COVID-19 outbreaks.\n\n\nMeasures\nLogistic regression models were applied with age, sex, functional status, diabetes, and hypertension as covariates.\n\n\nResults\nWe found a statistically significant association between statin intake and the absence of symptoms during COVID-19 (odds ratio [OR] 2.91; confidence interval [CI] 1.27–6.71), which remained statistically significant after adjusting for covariates (OR 2.65; CI 1.13–6.68).\n\n Although the effects of statin intake on serious clinical outcome were in the same beneficial direction, these were not statistically significant (OR 0.75; CI 0.24–1.87).\n\n There was also no statistically significant association between ACEi/ARB and asymptomatic status (OR 2.72; CI 0.59–25.1) or serious clinical outcome (OR 0.48; CI 0.10–1.97).\n\n\nConclusions and Implications\nOur data indicate that statin intake in older, frail adults could be associated with a considerable beneficial effect on COVID-19 clinical symptoms.\n\n The role of statins and renin-angiotensin system drugs needs to be further explored in larger observational studies as well as randomized clinical trials.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7294267","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"AMDA - The Society for Post-Acute and Long-Term Care Medicine.","authors":[{"firstname":"Anton","surname":"De

significance, we conducted a multicenter retrospective cohort study that included 5,771 adult patients with COVID?19 pneumonia in Hubei Province.\n\n\nApproach and Results\nWe reported the distributional and temporal patterns of liver injury indicators in these patients and determined their associated factors and death risk.\n\n Longitudinal liver function tests were retrospectively analyzed and correlated with the risk factors and death.\n\n Liver injury dynamic patterns differed in alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and total bilirubin (TBIL).\n\n AST elevated first, followed by ALT, in severe patients.\n\n ALP modestly increased during hospitalization and largely remained in the normal range.\n\n The fluctuation in TBIL levels was mild in the non?severe and the severe groups.\n\n AST abnormality was associated with the highest mortality risk compared with the other indicators of liver injury during hospitalization.\n\n Common factors associated with elevated liver injury indicators were lymphocyte count decrease, neutrophil count increase, and male gender.\n\n\nConclusion\nThe dynamic patterns of liver injury indicators and their potential risk factors may provide an important explanation for the COVID?19?associated liver injury.\n\n Because elevated liver injury indicators, particularly AST, are strongly associated with the mortality risk, our study indicates that these parameters should be monitored during hospitalization.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7267515","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"John Wiley and Sons

Protein Response and Enhances Temozolomide-Induced Cell Death in Glioblastoma Cells","abstract":"Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most prevalent malignant primary brain tumor with a very poor survival rate.\n Temozolomide (TMZ) is the common chemotherapeutic agent used for GBM treatment.\n We recently demonstrated that simvastatin (Simva) increases TMZ-induced apoptosis via the inhibition of autophagic flux in GBM cells.\n Considering the role of the unfolded protein response (UPR) pathway in the regulation of autophagy, we investigated the involvement of UPR in Simva–TMZ-induced cell death by utilizing highly selective IRE1 RNase activity inhibitor MKC8866, PERK inhibitor GSK-2606414 (PERKi), and eIF2? inhibitor salubrinal.\n Simva–TMZ treatment decreased the viability of GBM cells and significantly increased apoptotic cell death when compared to TMZ or Simva alone.\n Simva–TMZ induced both UPR, as determined by an increase in GRP78, XBP splicing, eukaryote initiation factor 2? (eIF2?) phosphorylation, and inhibited autophagic flux (accumulation of LC3?-II and inhibition of p62 degradation).\n IRE1 RNase inhibition did not affect Simva–TMZ-induced cell death, but it significantly induced p62 degradation and increased the microtubule-associated proteins light chain 3 (LC3)?-II/LC3?-I ratio in U87 cells, while salubrinal did not affect the Simva–TMZ induced cytotoxicity of GBM cells.\n In contrast, protein kinase RNA-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK) inhibition significantly increased Simva–TMZ-induced cell death in U87 cells.\n Interestingly, whereas PERK inhibition induced p62 accumulation in both GBM cell lines, it differentially affected the LC3?-II/LC3?-I ratio in U87 (decrease) and U251 (increase) cells.\n Simvastatin sensitizes GBM cells to TMZ-induced cell death via a mechanism that involves autophagy and UPR pathways.\n More specifically, our results imply that the IRE1 and PERK signaling arms of the UPR regulate Simva–TMZ-mediated autophagy flux inhibition in U251 and U87 GBM cells.\n

only chemotherapy choice for the treatment of GBM.\n However, TMZ also induces autophagy and causes tumor cell resistance and thus fails to improve the survival rate among patients.\n Here, we studied the drug-induced programmed cell death and invasion inhibition capacity of TMZ and a mevalonate cascade inhibitor, simvastatin (Simva), in a three-dimensional (3D) microfluidic model of GBM.\n We elucidate the role of autophagy in apoptotic cell death by comparing apoptosis in autophagy knockdown cells (Atg7 KD) against their scrambled counterparts.\n Our results show that the cells were significantly less sensitive to drugs in the 3D model as compared to monolayer culture systems.\n An immunofluorescence analysis confirmed that apoptosis is the mechanism of cell death in TMZ- and Simva-treated glioma cells.\n However, the induction of apoptosis in the 3D model is significantly lower than in monolayer cultures.\n We have also shown that autophagy inhibition (Atg7 KD) did not change TMZ and Simva-induced apoptosis in the 3D microfluidic model.\n Overall, for the first time in this study we have established the simultaneous detection of drug induced apoptosis and autophagy

however, the precise mechanism of action of TMZ in RMS remains unclear.\n Here we demonstrate that TMZ decreases the cell viability of the RH30 RMS and C2C12 cell line, where cells display evidence of mitochondrial outer membrane permeability.\n Interestingly, the C2C12 mouse myoblast line was relatively more resistant to TMZ-induced apoptosis.\n Moreover, we observed that TMZ activated biochemical and morphological markers of autophagy in both cell lines.\n Autophagy inhibition in both RH30 and C2C12 cells significantly increased TMZ-induced cell death.\n In RH30 cells, TMZ increased Mcl-1 and Bax protein expression compared to corresponding time match controls while in C2C12 Mcl-1, Bcl-2, Bcl-XL, and Bax protein expression were not changed.\n Baf-A1 co-treatment with TMZ significantly decrease Mcl-1 expression compared to TMZ while increase Bax expression in C2C12 cells (Bcl2 and Bcl-XL do not significantly change in Baf-A1/TMZ co-treatment).\n Using a three-dimensional (3D) C2C12 and RH30 culture model we demonstrated that TMZ is significantly more toxic in RH30 cells (live/dead assay).\n Additionally, we have observed in our 3D culture model that TMZ induced both apoptosis (cleavage of PARP) and autophagy (LC3-puncta and localization of LC3/p62).\n Therefore, our data demonstrate that TMZ induces simultaneous autophagy and apoptosis in both RH30 and C2C12 cells in 2D and 3D culture model, where RH30 cells are more sensitive to TMZ-induced death.\n Furthermore, autophagy serves to protect RH30 cells from TMZ-induced death.\n","id":"PMC6202374","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Nature Publishing Group UK","authors":[{"firstname":"Adel

Apoptosis in Medulloblastoma Brain Tumor Cells via Mevalonate Cascade Prenylation Substrates","abstract":"Medulloblastoma is a common pediatric brain tumor and one of the main types of solid cancers in children below the age of 10. Recently, cholesterol-lowering “statin” drugs have been highlighted for their possible anti-cancer effects.\n Clinically, statins are reported to have promising potential for consideration as an adjuvant therapy in different types of cancers.\n However, the anti-cancer effects of statins in medulloblastoma brain tumor cells are not currently well-defined.\n Here, we investigated the cell death mechanisms by which simvastatin mediates its effects on different human medulloblastoma cell lines.\n Simvastatin is a lipophilic drug that inhibits HMG-CoA reductase and has pleotropic effects.\n Inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase prevents the formation of essential downstream intermediates in the mevalonate cascade, such as farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP) and gernaylgerany parophosphate (GGPP).\n These intermediates are involved in the activation pathway of small Rho GTPase proteins in different cell types.\n We observed that simvastatin significantly induces dose-dependent apoptosis in three different medulloblastoma brain tumor cell lines (Daoy, D283, and D341 cells).\n Our investigation shows that simvastatin-induced cell death is regulated via prenylation intermediates of the cholesterol metabolism pathway.\n Our results indicate that the induction of different caspases (caspase 3, 7, 8, and 9) depends on the nature of the medulloblastoma cell line.\n Western blot analysis shows that simvastatin leads to changes in the expression of regulator proteins involved in apoptosis, such as Bax, Bcl-2, and Bcl-xl.\n Taken together, our data suggests the potential application of a novel non-classical adjuvant therapy for medulloblastoma, through the regulation of protein prenylation intermediates that occurs via inhibition of the mevalonate pathway.\n","id":"PMC6678292","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"MDPI","authors":[{"firstname":"Kimia","surname":"Sheikholeslami","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Annan","surname":"Ali

3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay when compared to three commonly used cell enumeration assays","abstract":"Background\nThe tetrazolium-based MTT assay has long been regarded as the gold standard of cytotoxicity assays as it is highly sensitive and has been miniaturised for use as a high-throughput screening assay.\n\n However, various reports refer to interference by different test compounds, including the glycolysis inhibitor 3-bromopyruvate, with the conversion of the dye to coloured formazan crystals.\n\n This study assessed the linear range and reproducibility of three commonly used cell enumeration assays; the neutral red uptake (NRU), resazurin reduction (RES) and sulforhodamine B (SRB) assays, in comparison to the MTT assay.\n\n Interference between the MTT assay and three glycolysis inhibitors, 2-deoxyglucose, 3-bromopyruvate and lonidamine, was investigated.\n\n\nResults\nData indicate that the NRU, RES and SRB assays showed the smallest variability across the linear range, while the largest variation was observed for the MTT assay.\n\n This implies that these assays would more accurately detect small changes in cell number than the MTT assay.\n\n The SRB assay provided the most reproducible results as indicated by the coefficient of determination after a limited number of experiments.\n\n The SRB assay also produced the lowest variance in the derived 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50), while IC50 concentrations of 3-bromopyruvate could not be detected using either the MTT or RES assays after 24 hours incubation.\n\n Interference in the MTT assay was observed for all three tested glycolysis inhibitors in a cell-free environment.\n\n No interferences were observed for the NRU, SRB or RES assays.\n\n\nConclusions\nThis study demonstrated that the MTT assay was not the best assay in a number of parameters that must be considered when a cell enumeration assay is selected: the MTT assay was less accurate in detecting changes in cell number as indicated by the variation observed in the linear range, had the highest variation when the IC50 concentrations of the glycolysis inhibitors were determined, and interference between the MTT assay and all the glycolysis inhibitors tested were observed.\n\n The SRB assay performed best overall considering all of the parameters, suggesting that it is the most suitable assay for use in preclinical screening of novel therapeutic compounds with oxido-reductive potential.\n\n\nElectronic supplementary material\nThe online version of this

demonstrated to modulate autophagic function.\n In this study, we investigated the combinational effects of lovastatin and TMZ on treating U87 and U251 GBM cell lines.\n Cytotoxicity was measured by MTT and colony formation assays; apoptosis was measured by flow cytometry; the cellular autophagic function was detected by the EGFP-mRFP-LC3 reporter and western blot assay.\n The results showed that lovastatin might enhance the cytotoxicity of TMZ, increase the TMZ-induced cellular apoptosis, and impair the autophagic flux in GBM cells.\n Lovastatin triggered autophagy initiation possibly by inhibiting the Akt/mTOR signaling pathway.\n Moreover, lovastatin might impair the autophagosome-lysosome fusion machinery by suppressing LAMP2 and dynein.\n These results suggested that lovastatin

of p53 function activates the IRE1?/XBP1 pathway to enhance protein folding and secretion through upregulation of IRE1? and subsequent activation of its target XBP1. We also show that wild-type p53 interacts with synoviolin (SYVN1)/HRD1/DER3, a transmembrane E3 ubiquitin ligase localized to ER during ER stress and removes unfolded proteins by reversing transport to the cytosol from the ER, and its interaction stimulates IRE1? degradation.\n Moreover, IRE1? inhibitor suppressed protein secretion, induced cell death in p53-deficient cells, and strongly suppressed the formation of tumors by p53-deficient human tumor cells in vivo compared with those that expressed wild-type p53. Therefore, our data imply that the IRE1?/XBP1 pathway serves as a target for therapy of chemoresistant tumors that express mutant p53.","id":"PMC4652982","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Impact Journals LLC","authors":[{"firstname":"Takushi","surname":"Namba","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Kiki","surname":"Chu","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Rika","surname":"Kodama","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Sanguine","surname":"Byun","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Kyoung Wan","surname":"Yoon","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Masatsugu","surname":"Hiraki","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Anna","surname":"Mandinova","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Sam W.","surname":"Lee","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"10.3390/cancers12020401","date":"2020-02-07","title":"Alternative Mechanisms of p53 Action During the Unfolded Protein Response","abstract":"The tumor suppressor protein p53 orchestrates cellular responses to a vast number of stresses, with DNA damage and oncogenic activation being some of the best described.\n The capacity of p53 to control cellular events such as cell cycle progression, DNA repair, and apoptosis, to mention some, has been mostly linked to its role as a transcription factor.\n However, how p53 integrates different signaling cascades to promote a particular pathway remains an open question.\n One way to broaden its capacity to respond to different stimuli is by the expression of isoforms that can modulate the activities of the full-length protein.\n One of these isoforms is p47 (p53/47, ?40p53, p53?N40), an alternative translation initiation variant whose expression is specifically induced by the PERK kinase during the Unfolded Protein Response (UPR) following Endoplasmic Reticulum stress.\n Despite the increasing knowledge on the p53 pathway, its activity when the translation machinery is globally suppressed during the UPR remains poorly understood.\n Here, we focus on the expression of p47 and we propose that the alternative initiation of p53 mRNA translation offers a unique condition-dependent mechanism to differentiate p53 activity to control cell homeostasis during the UPR.\n We also discuss how the manipulation of these processes may influence cancer cell physiology in light of therapeutic approaches.\n","id":"PMC7072472","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"MDPI","authors":[{"firstname":"Leïla T.

Bcl2, and L929 and MCF-7 over-expressing a dominant-negative mutant of a pro-apoptotic BNIP3 (?TM-BNIP3) were largely resistant towards Brevinin-2R treatment.\n The decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential (??m), or total cellular ATP levels, and increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, but not caspase activation or the release of apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) or endonuclease G (Endo G), were early indicators of Brevinin-2R-triggered death.\n Brevinin-2R interacts with both early and late endosomes.\n Lysosomal membrane permeabilization inhibitors and inhibitors of

fibroblasts to cardiac myofibroblasts","abstract":"The incidence of heart failure with concomitant cardiac fibrosis is very high in developed countries.\n Fibroblast activation in heart is causal to cardiac fibrosis as they convert to hypersynthetic cardiac myofibroblasts.\n There is no known treatment for cardiac fibrosis.\n Myofibroblasts contribute to the inappropriate remodeling of the myocardial interstitium, which leads to reduced cardiac function and ultimately heart failure.\n Elevated levels of autophagy have been linked to stress-induced ventricular remodeling and other cardiac diseases.\n Previously, we had shown that TGF-?1 treatment of human atrial fibroblasts both induced autophagy and enhanced the fibrogenic response supporting a linkage between the myofibroblast phenotype and autophagy.\n We now demonstrate that with in vitro culture of primary rat cardiac fibroblasts, inhibition of autophagy represses fibroblast to myofibroblast phenoconversion.\n Culturing unpassaged cardiac fibroblasts for 72 hours on plastic tissue culture plates is associated with elevated ?-smooth muscle actin (?-SMA) expression.\n This activation parallels increased microtubule-associated protein 1A/1B-light chain 3 (LC-3? II) protein expression.\n Inhibition of autophagy with bafilomycin-A1 (Baf-A1) and chloroquine (CQ) in cardiac fibroblasts significantly reduces ?-SMA and extracellular domain A fibronectin (ED-A FN) protein vs untreated controls.\n Myofibroblast cell migration and contractility were significantly reduced following inhibition of autophagy.\n These data support the possibility of a causal link

Plaques by Modulating Autophagy","abstract":"Atherosclerosis is a chronic disease comprising intima malfunction and arterial inflammation.\n Recent studies have demonstrated that autophagy could inhibit inflammatory response in atherosclerosis and exert subsequent atheroprotective effects.\n Our previous study also demonstrated the role of autophagy in the inhibition of inflammation by atorvastatin in vitro.\n Therefore, in the present study, we aimed to determine whether atorvastatin could upregulate autophagy to inhibit inflammatory cytokines secretion, lipid accumulation, and improve vulnerable plaque stability, both in vitro and in vivo.\n First, we established a vulnerable atherosclerotic plaque mouse model through partial ligation of left common carotid artery and left renal artery to explore the effect of atorvastatin on vulnerable plaques.\n The results showed that atorvastatin could enhance the stability of vulnerable atherosclerotic plaques and reduce the lesion area in the aorta.\n Atorvastatin could also inhibit NLRP3 inflammasome activation and inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-1?, TNF-?, and IL-18 secretion in vivo.\n Atorvastatin treatment upregulated the expression of autophagy-related protein microtubule-associated protein light chain (LC3B) and downregulated the expression of SQSTM1/p62, which suggested that autophagy was activated in vulnerable plaques.\n Transmission electron microscopy further demonstrated the atorvastatin-induced increase in autophagy activity in vulnerable atherosclerotic plaques.\n We employed oxidized low-density lipoprotein (ox-LDL) to stimulate RAW264.7 cells with atorvastatin, which showed that atorvastatin could attenuate lipid deposition, ameliorate inflammation, inhibit NLRP3 inflammasome activation, and enhance autophagy in vitro.\n All these beneficial effects were abolished by 3-methyladenine treatment, an autophagy inhibitor.\n Atorvastatin also significantly inhibited the phosphorylation of mTOR, which strongly suggested the involvement of the mTOR pathway.\n Our study proposed a new role for atorvastatin as an autophagy inducer to exert anti-inflammatory and atheroprotective effects, to stabilize vulnerable atherosclerotic plaques.\n","id":"PMC5943597","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Frontiers Media

inhibiting intracellular isoprenoids formation, statins suppress vascular and myocardial inflammation, favorably modulate vascular and myocardial redox state and improve nitric oxide bioavailability.\n Randomized clinical trials have demonstrated that further to their lipid lowering effects, statins are useful in the primary and secondary prevention of coronary heart disease (CHD) due to their anti-inflammatory potential.\n The landmark JUPITER trial suggested that in subjects without CHD, suppression of low-grade inflammation by statins improves clinical outcome.\n However, recent trials have failed to document any clinical benefit with statins in high risk groups, such in heart failure or chronic kidney disease patients.\n In this review, we aim to summarize the existing evidence on statins as an anti-inflammatory agent in atherogenesis.\n We describe the molecular mechanisms responsible for the anti-inflammatory effects of statins, as well as clinical data

autophagy in cardiovascular disease is poorly understood.\n Therefore, we investigated the effect of defective autophagy on VSMC survival and phenotype and its significance in the development of postinjury neointima formation and atherosclerosis.\n Tissue-specific deletion of the essential autophagy gene Atg7 in murine VSMCs (atg7?/? VSMCs) caused accumulation of SQSTM1/p62 and accelerated the development of stress-induced premature senescence as shown by cellular and nuclear hypertrophy, CDKN2A-RB-mediated G1 proliferative arrest and senescence-associated GLB1 activity.\n Transfection of SQSTM1-encoding plasmid DNA in Atg7+/+ VSMCs induced similar features, suggesting that accumulation of SQSTM1 promotes VSMC senescence.\n Interestingly, atg7?/? VSMCs were resistant to oxidative stress-induced cell death as compared to controls.\n This effect was attributed to nuclear translocation of the transcription factor NFE2L2 resulting in upregulation of several antioxidative enzymes.\n In vivo, defective VSMC autophagy led to upregulation of MMP9, TGFB and CXCL12 and promoted postinjury neointima formation and diet-induced atherogenesis.\n Lesions of VSMC-specific atg7 knockout mice were characterized by increased total collagen deposition, nuclear hypertrophy, CDKN2A upregulation, RB hypophosphorylation, and GLB1 activity, all features typical of cellular senescence.\n To conclude, autophagy is crucial for VSMC function, phenotype, and survival.\n Defective autophagy in VSMCs accelerates senescence and promotes ligation-induced neointima formation and diet-induced atherogenesis, implying that autophagy inhibition as therapeutic strategy in the treatment of neointimal stenosis and atherosclerosis would be unfavorable.\n Conversely,

BMMs and also prevented by caspase-1 inhibitor WEHD.\n In addition, in vitro and in vivo experiments revealed that migration of Asc+/+ BMMs increased due to stimulation of Nlrp3 inflammasomes, which was markedly attenuated in Asc?/? BMMs.\n Together, these results suggest that activation of Nlrp3 inflammasomes remarkably increases the susceptibility of macrophages to lipid deposition and their migration ability.\n Such novel action of inflammasomes may facilitate entry or retention of macrophages into the arterial wall, where they form foam cells and ultimately induce atherosclerosis.\n","id":"PMC3903678","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Public Library of Science","authors":[{"firstname":"Xiang","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yang","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Min","surname":"Xia","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Erich","surname":"Gulbins","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Krishna M.","surname":"Boini","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Pin-Lan","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"David M.","surname":"Ojcius","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"David M.","surname":"Ojcius","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.3892/etm.2017.4062","date":"2016-09-06","title":"Atorvastatin attenuates plaque vulnerability by downregulation of EMMPRIN expression via COX-2/PGE2 pathway","abstract":"Extracellular matrix metalloproteinase inducer (EMMPRIN) reportedly has a key regulatory role in matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) activities and the progression of atherosclerosis.\n Statins, which are anti-atherosclerotic pharmacological agents, are widely applied in clinical settings.\n The aim of the present study was to investigate the pharmaceutical effect of atorvastatin on EMMPRIN expression in atherosclerotic plaques.\n An atherosclerotic mouse model was established using apoliprotein E-deficient (ApoE?/?) mice raised on a high-fat diet.\n Additionally, a low (5 mg/kg/day) or high dosage (10 mg/kg/day) of atorvastatin suspension was administered orally for eight weeks, beginning on week 7 or 11 respectively.\n The effects of atorvastatin on atherosclerotic plaque formation and EMMPRIN expression were subsequently determined.\n The THP-1 cell line was used to investigate the effect of atorvastatin on EMMPRIN expression in vitro.\n The results demonstrated that the high-fat diet led to vulnerable plaques (VPs) and increased EMMPRIN expression in VPs in ApoE?/? mice.\n Atorvastatin treatment decreased EMMPRIN expression in the aortas and plaques of ApoE?/? mice.\n In vitro, oxidized low-density lipoprotein (ox-LDL) induced the expression of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and EMMPRIN in THP-1 macrophages, and atorvastatin inhibited ox-LDL-induced expression of PGE2, EMMPRIN and COX-2 in THP-1 macrophages.\n Therefore, the present data indicated that atorvastatin treatment reduces the vulnerability of atherosclerotic plaques and expression of EMMPRIN, and that the inhibitory effect of atorvastatin on EMMPRIN may occur via the COX-2/PGE2 signaling pathway in macrophages.\n","id":"PMC5403495","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"D.A.

However, the underlying mechanisms are not fully understood.\n Using a previously established mouse model for vulnerable atherosclerotic plaque, we investigated the effect of atorvastatin (10 mg/kg/day) on plaque morphology.\n Atorvastatin did not lower plasma total cholesterol levels or affect plaque progression at this dosage; however, vulnerable plaque numbers were significantly reduced in the atorvastatin-treated group compared to control.\n Detailed examinations revealed that atorvastatin significantly decreased macrophage infiltration and subendothelial lipid deposition, reduced intimal collagen content, and elevated collagenase activity and expression of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs).\n Because vascular inflammation is largely driven by changes in monocyte/macrophage numbers in the vessel wall, we speculated that the anti-inflammatory effect of atorvastatin may partially result from decreased monocyte recruitment to the endothelium.\n Further experiments showed that atorvastatin downregulated expression of the chemokines monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1, chemokine (C-X3-C motif) ligand 1 (CX3CL1) and their receptors CCR2 and, CX3CR1, which are mainly responsible for monocyte recruitment.\n In addition, levels of the plasma inflammatory markers C-reactive protein (CRP) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-? were also significantly decrease in atorvastatin-treated mice.\n Collectively, our results demonstrate that atorvastatin can improve plaque stability in mice independent of plasma cholesterol levels.\n Given the profound inhibition of macrophage infiltration into atherosclerotic plaques, we propose that statins may partly exert protective effects by modulating levels of chemokines and their receptors.\n These findings elucidate yet another atheroprotective mechanism of statins.\n","id":"PMC4016207","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Public Library of

(TNF-?), in macrophages.\n Autophagy, an intracellular self-digestion process, has been recently shown to regulate inflammatory responses.\n In the present study, we investigated the role of autophagy induction in the suppression of Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) -induced TNF-? expression by globular adiponectin (gAcrp) and its potential mechanisms.\n Herein, we found that gAcrp treatment increased expression of genes related with autophagy, including Atg5 and microtubule-associated protein light chain (LC3B), induced autophagosome formation and autophagy flux in RAW 264.7 macrophages.\n Similar results were observed in primary macrophages isolated peritoneum of mice.\n Interestingly, inhibition of autophagy by pretreatment with Bafilomycin A1 or knocking down of LC3B gene restored suppression of TNF-? expression, tumor necrosis factor receptor- associated factor 6 (TRAF6) expression and p38MAPK phosphorylation by gAcrp, implying a critical role of autophagy induction in the development of tolerance to LPS-induced TNF-? expression by gAcrp.\n We also found that knocking-down of FoxO3A, a forkhead box O member of transcription factor, blocked gAcrp-induced expression of LC3II and Atg5. Moreover, gene silencing of Silent information regulator 1 (SIRT1) blocked both gAcrp-induced nuclear translocation of FoxO3A and LC3II expression.\n Finally, pretreatment with ROS inhibitors, prevented gAcrp-induced SIRT1 expression and further generated inhibitory effects on gAcrp-induced autophagy, indicating a role of ROS production in gAcrp-induced SIRT1 expression and subsequent autophagy induction.\n Taken together, these findings indicate that globular adiponectin suppresses LPS-induced TNF-? expression, at least in part, via autophagy activation.\n Furthermore, SIRT1-FoxO3A axis plays a crucial role in gAcrp-induced autophagy in macrophages.\n","id":"PMC4427353","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Public Library of Science","authors":[{"firstname":"Nirmala","surname":"Tilija Pun","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Amit","surname":"Subedi","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Mi Jin","surname":"Kim","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Pil-Hoon","surname":"Park","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Deyu","surname":"Fang","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Deyu","surname":"Fang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1371/journal.pone.0011765","date":"2010-06-24","title":"Cholesterol Crystals Activate the NLRP3 Inflammasome in Human Macrophages: A Novel Link between Cholesterol Metabolism and Inflammation","abstract":"Background\nChronic inflammation of the arterial wall is a key element in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis, yet the factors that trigger and sustain the inflammation remain elusive.\n\n Inflammasomes are cytoplasmic caspase-1-activating protein complexes that promote maturation and secretion of the proinflammatory cytokines interleukin(IL)-1? and IL-18. The most intensively studied inflammasome, NLRP3 inflammasome, is activated by diverse substances, including crystalline and particulate materials.\n\n As cholesterol crystals are abundant in atherosclerotic lesions, and IL-1? has been linked to atherogenesis, we explored the possibility that cholesterol crystals promote inflammation by activating the inflammasome pathway.\n\n\nPrincipal Findings\nHere we show that human macrophages avidly phagocytose cholesterol crystals and store the ingested cholesterol as cholesteryl esters.\n\n Importantly, cholesterol crystals induced dose-dependent secretion of mature IL-1? from human monocytes and macrophages.\n\n The cholesterol crystal-induced secretion of IL-1? was caspase-1-dependent, suggesting the involvement of an inflammasome-mediated pathway.\n\n Silencing of the NLRP3 receptor, the crucial component in NLRP3 inflammasome, completely abolished crystal-induced IL-1? secretion, thus identifying NLRP3 inflammasome as the cholesterol crystal-responsive element in macrophages.\n\n The crystals were shown to induce leakage of the lysosomal protease cathepsin B into the cytoplasm and inhibition of this enzyme reduced cholesterol crystal-induced IL-1? secretion, suggesting that NLRP3 inflammasome activation occurred via lysosomal destabilization.\n\n\nConclusions\nThe cholesterol crystal-induced

lymphocyte subsets by flow cytometry and cytokine profiles by specific immunoassays.\n\n\nFindings\nOf the 40 COVID-19 patients enrolled, 13 severe cases showed significant and sustained decreases in lymphocyte counts [0·6 (0·6-0·8)] but increases in neutrophil counts [4·7 (3·6-5·8)] than 27 mild cases [1.1 (0·8-1·4); 2·0 (1·5-2·9)].\n\n Further analysis demonstrated significant decreases in the

Coronavirus Pneumonia (6th edition)” issued by the National Health Commission of China.\n\n The clinical and laboratory data were collected.\n\n The serum viral load and IL-6 levels were determined.\n\n .\n\n\nResults\nClinical characteristics analysis of 48 cases of COVID-19 showed that RNAaemia was diagnosed only in the critically ill group and seemed to reflect the severity of the disease.\n\n Furthermore, the level of inflammatory cytokine IL-6 in critically ill patients increased significantly, almost 10 times that in other patients.\n\n More importantly, the extremely high IL-6 level was closely correlated with the detection of RNAaemia (R = 0.902).\n\n\nConclusions\nDetectable serum SARS-Cov-2 RNA(RNAaemia) in COVID-19 patients was associated with elevated IL-6 concentration and poor prognosis.\n\n Because the elevated IL-6 may be part of a larger cytokine storm which could worsen outcome, IL-6 could be a potential therapeutic target for critically ill patients with an excessive inflammatory response.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7184354","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Oxford University

characteristics of the affected patients.\n\n\nMethods\nWe extracted data regarding 1099 patients with laboratory-confirmed Covid-19 from 552 hospitals in 30 provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities in mainland China through January 29, 2020. The primary composite end point was admission to an intensive care unit (ICU), the use of mechanical ventilation, or death.\n\n\nResults\nThe median age of the patients was 47 years; 41.9% of the patients were female.\n\n The primary composite end point occurred in 67 patients (6.1%), including 5.0% who were admitted to the ICU, 2.3% who underwent invasive mechanical ventilation, and 1.4% who died.\n\n Only 1.9% of the patients had a history of direct contact with wildlife.\n\n Among nonresidents of Wuhan, 72.3% had contact with residents of Wuhan, including 31.3% who had visited the city.\n\n The most common symptoms were fever (43.8% on admission and 88.7% during hospitalization) and cough (67.8%).\n\n Diarrhea was uncommon (3.8%).\n\n The median incubation period was 4 days (interquartile range, 2 to 7).\n\n On admission, ground-glass opacity was the most common radiologic finding on chest computed tomography (CT) (56.4%).\n\n No radiographic or CT abnormality was found

The outcomes were (1) serious COVID-19 defined as long-stay hospital admission or death within 14 days of disease onset, and (2) asymptomatic (ie, no disease symptoms in the whole study period while still being diagnosed by polymerase chain reaction).\n\n\nSetting and participants\nA total of 154 COVID-19–positive subjects were identified, residing in 1 of 2 Belgian nursing homes that experienced similar COVID-19 outbreaks.\n\n\nMeasures\nLogistic regression models were applied with age, sex, functional status, diabetes, and hypertension as covariates.\n\n\nResults\nWe found a statistically significant association between statin intake and the absence of symptoms during COVID-19 (odds ratio [OR] 2.91; confidence interval [CI] 1.27–6.71), which remained statistically significant after adjusting for covariates (OR 2.65; CI 1.13–6.68).\n\n Although the effects of statin intake on serious clinical outcome were in the same beneficial direction, these were not statistically significant (OR 0.75; CI 0.24–1.87).\n\n There was also no statistically significant association between ACEi/ARB and asymptomatic status (OR 2.72; CI 0.59–25.1) or serious clinical outcome (OR 0.48; CI 0.10–1.97).\n\n\nConclusions and Implications\nOur data indicate that statin intake in older, frail adults could be associated with a considerable beneficial effect on COVID-19 clinical symptoms.\n\n The role of statins and renin-angiotensin system drugs needs to be further explored in larger observational studies as well as randomized clinical trials.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7294267","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"AMDA - The Society for Post-Acute and Long-Term Care Medicine.","authors":[{"firstname":"Anton","surname":"De Spiegeleer","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Antoon","surname":"Bronselaer","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"James T.","surname":"Teo","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Geert","surname":"Byttebier","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Guy","surname":"De Tré","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Luc","surname":"Belmans","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Richard","surname":"Dobson","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Evelien","surname":"Wynendaele","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Christophe","surname":"Van De Wiele","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Filip","surname":"Vandaele","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Diemer","surname":"Van Dijck","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Dan","surname":"Bean","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"David","surname":"Fedson","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Bart","surname":"De Spiegeleer","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1016/j.virol.2008.08.026","date":"2008-08-17","title":"Importance of cholesterol-rich membrane microdomains in the interaction of the S protein of SARS-coronavirus with the cellular receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2","abstract":"Cholesterol present in the plasma membrane of target cells has been shown to be important for the infection by SARS-CoV.\n We show that cholesterol depletion by treatment with methyl-?-cyclodextrin (m?CD) affects infection by SARS-CoV to the same extent as infection by vesicular stomatitis virus-based pseudotypes containing the surface glycoprotein S of SARS-CoV (VSV-?G-S).\n Therefore, the role of cholesterol for SARS-CoV infection can be assigned to the S protein and is unaffected by other coronavirus proteins.\n There have been contradictory reports whether or not angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the cellular receptor for SARS-CoV, is present in detergent-resistant membrane domains.\n We found that ACE2 of both Vero E6 and Caco-2 cells co-purifies with marker proteins of detergent-resistant membranes supporting the notion that cholesterol-rich microdomains provide a platform facilitating the efficient interaction of the S protein with the cellular receptor ACE2.

systems requiring the rapid development of treatments, at least, to reduce COVID?19 severity.\n\n Drug repurposing offers a fast track.\n\n Here, we discuss the potential beneficial effects of statins in COVID?19 patients based on evidence that they may target virus receptors, replication, degradation, and downstream responses in infected cells, addressing both basic research and epidemiological information.\n\n Briefly, statins could modulate virus entry, acting on the SARS?CoV?2 receptors, ACE2 and CD147, and/or lipid rafts engagement.\n\n Statins, by inducing autophagy activation, could regulate virus replication or degradation, exerting protective effects.\n\n The well?known anti?inflammatory properties of statins, by blocking several molecular mechanisms, including NF??B and NLRP3

There is also evidence linking endothelial cells (ECs) to SARS-CoV-2 infection including: (i) the expression and function of its receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) in the vasculature; (ii) the prevalence of a Kawasaki disease-like syndrome (vasculitis) in COVID-19; and (iii) evidence of EC infection with SARS-CoV-2 in patients with fatal COVID-19.

Demographic, clinical, treatment, and laboratory data, including serial samples for viral RNA detection, were extracted from electronic medical records and compared between survivors and

Hypertension, and Cardiovascular Disease: Clinical Insights and Vascular Mechanisms","abstract":"Hypertension and type 2 diabetes are common comorbidities.\n Hypertension is twice as frequent in patients with diabetes compared with those who do not have diabetes.\n Moreover, patients with hypertension often exhibit insulin resistance and are at greater risk of diabetes developing than are normotensive individuals.\n The major cause of morbidity and mortality in diabetes is cardiovascular disease, which is exacerbated by hypertension.\n Accordingly, diabetes and hypertension are closely interlinked because of similar risk factors, such as endothelial dysfunction, vascular inflammation, arterial remodelling, atherosclerosis, dyslipidemia, and obesity.\n There is also substantial overlap in the cardiovascular complications of diabetes and hypertension related primarily to microvascular and macrovascular disease.\n Common mechanisms, such as upregulation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, oxidative stress, inflammation, and activation of the immune system likely contribute to the close relationship between diabetes and hypertension.\n In this article we discuss diabetes and hypertension as comorbidities and discuss the pathophysiological features of vascular complications associated with these conditions.\n We also highlight some vascular mechanisms that predispose to both conditions, focusing on advanced glycation end products, oxidative stress, inflammation, the immune system, and microRNAs.\n Finally, we provide some insights into current therapies targeting diabetes and cardiovascular complications and introduce some new agents that may have vasoprotective therapeutic potential in diabetes.\n","id":"PMC5953551","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Pulsus Group","authors":[{"firstname":"John

provide specific recommendations on statin initiation in acute ischemic stroke (AIS).\n\n The current study aims to systematically review the statin effect in AIS.\n\n\nMethods\nFrom literature review, we identified articles exploring prestroke and immediate post-stroke statin effect on imaging surrogate markers, initial stroke severity, functional outcome, and short-term mortality in human AIS.\n\n We summarized descriptive overview.\n\n In addition, for subjects with available data from publications, we conducted meta-analysis to provide pooled estimates.\n\n\nResults\nIn total, we identified 70 relevant articles including 6 meta-analyses.\n\n Surrogate imaging marker studies suggested that statin might enhance collaterals and reperfusion.\n\n Our updated meta-analysis indicated that prestroke statin use was associated with milder initial stroke severity (odds ratio [OR] [95% confidence interval], 1.24 [1.05-1.48]; P=0.013), good functional outcome (1.50 [1.29-1.75]; P&lt;0.001), and lower mortality (0.42 [0.21-0.82]; P=0.0108).\n\n In-hospital statin use was associated with good functional outcome (1.31 [1.12-1.53]; P=0.001), and lower mortality (0.41 [0.29-0.58]; P&lt;0.001).\n\n In contrast, statin withdrawal was associated with poor functional outcome (1.83 [1.01-3.30]; P=0.045).\n\n In patients treated with thrombolysis, statin was associated with good functional outcome (1.44 [1.10-1.89]; P=0.001), despite an increased risk of symptomatic hemorrhagic transformation (1.63 [1.04-2.56]; P=0.035).\n\n\nConclusions\nThe current study findings support the use of statin in AIS.\n\n However, the findings were mostly driven by observational studies at risk of bias, and thereby large randomized clinical trials would provide confirmatory

2009 strained healthcare resources.\n Because lung injury in ARDS can be influenced by daily management and multiple organ failure, we performed a retrospective cohort study to understand the severity of H1N1 associated ARDS after adjustment for treatment.\n Sixty subjects were identified in our hospital with ARDS from “direct injury” within 24 hours of ICU admission over a three month period.\n Twenty-three subjects (38.3%) were positive for H1N1 within 72 hours of hospitalization.\n These cases of H1N1-associated ARDS were compared to non-H1N1 associated ARDS patients.\n Subjects with H1N1-associated ARDS were younger and more likely to have a higher body mass index (BMI), present more rapidly and have worse oxygenation.\n Severity of illness (SOFA score) was directly related to worse oxygenation.\n Management was similar between the two groups on the day of admission and subsequent five days with respect to tidal volumes used, fluid balance and transfusion practices.\n There was, however, more frequent use of “rescue” therapy like prone ventilation, HFOV or ECMO in H1N1 patients.\n First morning set tidal volumes and BMI were significantly associated with increased severity of lung injury (Lung injury score, LIS) at presentation and over time while prior prescription of statins was protective.\n After assessment of the effect of these co-interventions LIS was

on direct interaction","abstract":"Introduction\nNo proven drug and no immunisation are yet available for COVID-19 disease.\n\n The SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro), a key coronavirus enzyme, which is a potential drug target, has been successfully crystallised.\n\n There is evidence suggesting that statins exert anti-viral activity and may block the infectivity of enveloped viruses.\n\n The aim of this study was to assess whether statins are potential COVID-19 Mpro inhibitors, using a molecular docking study.\n\n\nMaterial and methods\nMolecular docking was performed using AutoDock/Vina, a computational docking program.\n\n SARS-CoV-2 Mpro was docked with all statins, while antiviral and antiretroviral drugs – favipiravir, nelfinavir, and lopinavir – were used as standards for comparison.\n\n\nResults\nThe binding energies obtained from the docking of 6LU7 with native ligand favipiravir, nelfinavir, lopinavir, simvastatin, rosuvastatin, pravastatin, pitavastatin, lovastatin, fluvastatin, and atorvastatin were –6.8, –5.8, –7.9, –7.9, –7.0, –7.7, –6.6, –8.2, –7.4, –7.7, and –6.8 kcal/mol, respectively.\n\n The number of hydrogen bonds between statins and amino acid residues of Mpro were 7, 4, and 3 for rosuvastatin, pravastatin, and atorvastatin, respectively, while other statins had two hydrogen bonds.\n\n\nConclusions\nThese results indicate, based upon the binding energy of pitavastatin, rosuvastatin, lovastatin, and fluvastatin, that statins could be efficient SARS-CoV-2 Mpro inhibitors.\n\n This is supported by the fact that the effects of some statins, especially pitavastatin, have a binding energy that is even greater than that of protease or polymerase inhibitors.\n\n However, further research is necessary to investigate their potential use as drugs for COVID-19.\n","id":"PMC7212226","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Termedia Publishing

integration with epidemiological data enabled precise reconstruction of exposure events and incubation periods.\n\n Secondary attack rates were calculated as the number of cases divided by the number of contacts, using Fisher's exact test for the 95% CIs.\n\n\nFindings\nPatient 0 was a Chinese resident who visited Germany for professional reasons.\n\n 16 subsequent cases, often with mild and non-specific symptoms, emerged in four transmission generations.\n\n Signature mutations in the viral genome occurred upon foundation of generation 2, as well as in one case pertaining to generation 4. The median incubation period was 4·0 days (IQR 2·3–4·3) and the median serial interval was 4·0 days (3·0–5·0).\n\n Transmission events were likely to have occurred presymptomatically for one case (possibly five more), at the day of symptom onset for four cases (possibly five more), and the remainder after the day of symptom onset or unknown.\n\n One or two cases resulted from contact with a case during the prodromal phase.\n\n Secondary attack rates were 75·0% (95% CI 19·0–99·0; three of four people) among members of a household cluster in common isolation, 10·0% (1·2–32·0; two of 20) among household contacts only together until isolation of the patient, and 5·1% (2·6–8·9; 11 of 217) among non-household, high-risk contacts.\n\n\nInterpretation\nAlthough patients in our study presented with predominately mild, non-specific symptoms, infectiousness before or on the day of symptom onset was substantial.\n\n Additionally, the incubation period was often very short and false-negative tests occurred.\n\n These results suggest that although the outbreak was controlled, successful long-term and global containment of COVID-19 could be difficult to achieve.\n\n\nFunding\nAll authors are employed and all expenses covered by governmental, federal state, or other publicly funded

universal vaccination with Bacillus Calmette–Guerin (BCG) and the widespread use of the antimalarial drug chloroquine (CQ).\n Both have been amply discussed in the recent literature with positive and negative conclusions: we felt that a comprehensive presentation of the data available on them would be useful.\n The analysis of data for countries with over 1000 reported COVID-19 cases has shown that the incidence and mortality were higher in countries in which BCG vaccination is either absent or has been discontinued, as compared with the countries with universal vaccination.\n We have performed a similar analysis of the data available for CQ, a widely used drug in the African continent and in other countries in which malaria is endemic; we discuss it here because CQ has been used as the drug to treat COVID-19 patients.\n Several African countries no longer recommend it officially for the fight against malaria, due to the development of resistance to Plasmodium, but its use across the continent is still diffuse.\n Taken together, the data in the literature have led to the suggestion of a possible inverse correlation between BCG immunization and COVID-19 disease incidence

receptor blockers (ARBs), and HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (“statins”) have been hypothesized to affect COVID-19 severity.\n\n However, up to now, no studies investigating this association have been conducted in the most vulnerable and affected population groups (ie, older adults residing in nursing homes).\n\n The objective of this study was to explore the association of ACEi/ARB and/or statins with clinical manifestations in COVID-19–infected older adults residing in nursing homes.\n\n\nDesign\nWe undertook a retrospective multicenter cohort study to analyze the association between ACEi/ARB and/or statin use with clinical outcome of COVID-19.

and symptoms to determine if a patient presenting in primary care or hospital outpatient settings has COVID?19 disease","abstract":"Background\nSome people with SARS?CoV?2 infection remain asymptomatic, whilst in others the infection can cause mild to moderate COVID?19 disease and COVID?19 pneumonia, leading some patients to require intensive care support and, in some cases, to death, especially in older adults.\n\n Symptoms such as fever or cough, and signs such as oxygen saturation or lung auscultation findings, are the first and most readily available diagnostic information.\n\n Such information could be used to either rule out COVID?19 disease, or select patients for further diagnostic testing.\n\n\nObjectives\nTo assess the diagnostic accuracy of signs and symptoms to determine if a person presenting in primary care or to hospital outpatient settings, such as the emergency department or dedicated COVID?19 clinics, has COVID?19 disease or COVID?19 pneumonia.\n\n\nSearch methods\nOn 27 April 2020, we undertook electronic searches in the Cochrane COVID?19 Study Register and the University of Bern living search database, which is updated daily with published articles from PubMed and Embase and with preprints from medRxiv and bioRxiv.\n\n In addition, we checked repositories of COVID?19 publications.\n\n We did not apply any language restrictions.\n\n\nSelection criteria\nStudies were eligible if they included patients with suspected COVID?19 disease, or if they recruited known cases with COVID?19 disease and controls without COVID?19. Studies were eligible when they recruited patients presenting to primary care or hospital outpatient settings.\n\n Studies including patients who contracted SARS?CoV?2 infection while admitted to hospital were not eligible.\n\n The minimum eligible sample size of studies was 10 participants.\n\n All signs and symptoms were eligible for this review, including individual signs and symptoms or combinations.\n\n We accepted a range of reference standards including reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT?PCR), clinical expertise, imaging, serology tests and World Health Organization (WHO) or other definitions of COVID?19.\nData collection and analysis\nPairs of review authors independently selected all studies, at both title and abstract stage and full?text stage.\n\n They resolved any disagreements by discussion with a third review author.\n\n Two review authors independently extracted data and resolved disagreements by discussion with a third review author.\n\n Two review authors independently assessed risk of bias using the QUADAS?2 checklist.\n\n Analyses were descriptive, presenting sensitivity and specificity in paired forest plots, in ROC (receiver operating characteristic) space and in dumbbell plots.\n\n We did not attempt meta?analysis due to the small number of studies, heterogeneity across studies and the high risk of bias.\n\n\nMain results\nWe identified 16 studies including 7706 participants in total.\n\n Prevalence of COVID?19 disease varied from 5% to 38% with a median of 17%.\n\n There were no studies from primary care settings, although we did find seven studies in outpatient clinics (2172 participants), and four studies in the emergency department (1401 participants).\n\n We found data on 27 signs and symptoms, which fall into four different categories: systemic, respiratory, gastrointestinal and cardiovascular.\n\n No studies assessed combinations of different signs and symptoms and results were highly variable across studies.\n\n Most had very low sensitivity and high specificity; only six symptoms had a sensitivity of at least 50% in at least one study: cough, sore throat, fever, myalgia or arthralgia, fatigue, and headache.\n\n Of these, fever, myalgia or arthralgia, fatigue, and headache could be considered red flags (defined as having a positive likelihood ratio of at least 5) for COVID?19 as their specificity was above 90%, meaning that they substantially increase the likelihood of COVID?19 disease when present.\n\n\nAuthors' conclusions\nThe individual signs and symptoms included in this review appear to have very poor diagnostic properties, although this should be interpreted in the context of selection bias and heterogeneity between studies.\n\n Based on currently available data, neither absence nor presence of signs or symptoms are accurate enough to rule in or rule out disease.\n\n Prospective studies in an unselected population presenting to primary care or hospital outpatient settings, examining combinations of signs and symptoms to evaluate the syndromic presentation of COVID?19 disease, are urgently needed.\n\n Results from such studies could inform subsequent management decisions such as self?isolation or selecting patients for further diagnostic testing.\n\n We also need data on potentially more specific symptoms such as loss of sense of smell.\n\n Studies in older adults are especially important.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7386785","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"John Wiley &amp; Sons,

symptoms and their distribution allows for the early identification of infected patients.\n\n\nObjective\nTo determine the distribution pattern of COVID-19 symptoms as well as possible unreported symptoms, we created an app-based self-reporting tool.\n\n\nMethods\nThe COVID-19 Symptom Tracker is an app-based daily self-reporting tool.\n\n Between April 8 and May 15, 2020, a total of 22,327 individuals installed this app on their mobile device.\n\n An initial questionnaire asked for demographic information (age, gender, postal code) and past medical history comprising relevant chronic diseases.\n\n The participants were reminded daily to report whether they were experiencing any symptoms and if they had been tested for SARS-CoV-2 infection.\n\n Participants who sought health care services were asked additional questions regarding diagnostics and treatment.\n\n Participation was open to all adults (?18 years).\n\n The study was completely anonymous.\n\n\nResults\nIn total, 11,829 (52.98%) participants completed the symptom questionnaire at least once.\n\n Of these, 291 (2.46%) participants stated that they had undergone an RT-PCR (reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction) test for SARS-CoV-2; 65 (0.55%) reported a positive test result and 226 (1.91%) a negative one.\n\n The mean number of reported symptoms among untested participants was 0.81 (SD 1.85).\n\n Participants with a positive test result had, on average, 5.63 symptoms (SD 2.82).\n\n The most significant risk factors were diabetes (odds ratio [OR] 8.95, 95% CI 3.30-22.37) and chronic heart disease (OR 2.85, 95% CI 1.43-5.69).\n\n We identified chills, fever, loss of smell, nausea and vomiting, and shortness of breath as the top five strongest predictors for a COVID-19 infection.\n\n The odds ratio for loss of smell was 3.13 (95% CI 1.76-5.58).\n\n Nausea and vomiting (OR 2.84, 95% CI 1.61-5.00) had been reported as an uncommon symptom previously; however, our data suggest a significant predictive value.\n\n\nConclusions\nSelf-reported symptom tracking helps to identify novel symptoms of COVID-19 and to estimate the predictive value of certain symptoms.\n\n This aids in the development of reliable screening tools.\n\n Clinical screening with a high pretest probability allows for the rapid identification of infections and the cost-effective use of testing resources.\n\n Based on our results, we suggest that loss of smell and taste be considered cardinal symptoms; we also stress that diabetes is a risk factor for a highly symptomatic course of COVID-19

and the COVID-19 main protease: <italic>in silico</italic> evidence on direct interaction","abstract":"Introduction\nNo proven drug and no immunisation are yet available for COVID-19 disease.\n\n The SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro), a key coronavirus enzyme, which is a potential drug target, has been successfully crystallised.\n\n There is evidence suggesting that statins exert anti-viral activity and may block the infectivity of enveloped viruses.\n\n The aim of this study was to assess whether statins are potential COVID-19 Mpro inhibitors, using a molecular docking study.\n\n\nMaterial and methods\nMolecular docking was performed using AutoDock/Vina, a computational docking program.\n\n SARS-CoV-2 Mpro was docked with all statins, while antiviral and antiretroviral drugs – favipiravir, nelfinavir, and lopinavir – were used as standards for comparison.\n\n\nResults\nThe binding energies obtained from the docking of 6LU7 with native ligand favipiravir, nelfinavir, lopinavir, simvastatin, rosuvastatin, pravastatin, pitavastatin, lovastatin, fluvastatin, and atorvastatin were –6.8, –5.8, –7.9, –7.9, –7.0, –7.7, –6.6, –8.2, –7.4, –7.7, and –6.8 kcal/mol, respectively.\n\n The number of hydrogen bonds between statins and amino acid residues of Mpro were 7, 4, and 3 for rosuvastatin, pravastatin, and atorvastatin, respectively, while other statins had two hydrogen bonds.\n\n\nConclusions\nThese results indicate, based upon the binding energy of pitavastatin, rosuvastatin, lovastatin, and fluvastatin, that statins could be efficient SARS-CoV-2 Mpro inhibitors.\n\n This is supported by the fact that the effects of some statins, especially pitavastatin, have a binding energy that is even greater than that of protease or polymerase inhibitors.\n\n

(1996 to 2006) using linked administrative databases in Ontario, Canada.\n\n We identified all adults older than 65 years who had received an influenza vaccination prior to the start of influenza season and distinguished those also prescribed statins (23%) from those not also prescribed statins (77%).\n\n Propensity-based matching, which accounted for each individual's likelihood of receiving a statin, yielded a final cohort of 2,240,638 patients, exactly half of whom received statins.\n\n Statins were associated with small protective effects against pneumonia hospitalization (odds ratio [OR] 0.92; 95% CI 0.89–0.95), 30-day pneumonia mortality (0.84; 95% CI 0.77–0.91), and all-cause mortality (0.87; 95% CI 0.84–0.89).\n\n These protective effects attenuated substantially after

allocated into three groups: control group (n = 12), surgery group (n = 12), and statin group (n = 12).\n\n Aortic endothelial denudation of rats was performed using 2F balloon catheters.\n\n At days 14 and 28 after injury, aortic arteries were harvested to examine the following.\n\n Intimal thickening was examined by hematoxylin and eosin staining.\n\n We measured angiotensin II (Ang II) and angiotensin 1-7 (Ang-[1–7]) levels by a radioimmunological method or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.\n\n Protein and mRNA expression of ACE2 and Ang II type 1 receptor (AT1) were investigated by

Most strokes were cryptogenic, possibly related to an acquired hypercoagulability, and mortality was increased.\n\n Studies are needed to determine the utility of therapeutic anticoagulation for

and increased CD4+ cell counts in acute infection models and in chronically HIV-1–infected patients.\n Viral entry and exit was reduced in statin-treated cells, and inhibition was blocked by the addition of l-mevalonate or of geranylgeranylpyrophosphate, but not by cholesterol.\n Cell treatment with a geranylgeranyl transferase inhibitor, but not a farnesyl transferase inhibitor, specifically inhibited entry of HIV-1–pseudotyped viruses.\n Statins blocked Rho-A activation induced by HIV-1 binding to target cells, and expression of the dominant negative mutant RhoN19 inhibited HIV-1 envelope fusion with target cell membranes, reducing cell infection rates.\n We suggest that statins have direct anti–HIV-1 effects by targeting Rho.\n","id":"PMC2211926","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"The Rockefeller University Press","authors":[{"firstname":"Gustavo","surname":"del

antiapoptotic features have been collectively referred to as pleiotropic effects.\n Severe sepsis is an intense infection-induced inflammatory syndrome that ultimately results in organ dysfunction.\n Because so many cascades are triggered during sepsis, merely blocking a single component may be insufficient to arrest the inflammatory process.\n A growing body of evidence suggests that statins may indeed have a protective effect against severe sepsis and reduce the rate of infection-related mortality.\n This novel primary prevention concept may have far-reaching implications for the future management of serious infections.\n Moreover, it was recently shown that statins potentially improve outcome after the onset of sepsis.\n The stage is now set for randomized clinical trials that will determine the precise role, if any, that statins may have in preventing and treating sepsis.\n","id":"PMC1550787","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"BioMed

important health risks that lead to significant respiratory infections.\n Continuous antigenic changes and lack of promising vaccines are the reasons for the unsuccessful treatment of influenza.\n Statins are pleiotropic drugs that have recently served as anti-influenza agents due to their anti-inflammatory activity.\n In this study, the effect of simvastatin on influenza A-infected cells was investigated.\n Based on the MTT cytotoxicity test, hemagglutination (HA) assay and qPCR it was found that simvastatin maintained cell viability and decreased the viral load significantly as compared to virus-inoculated cells.\n The expression of important pro-inflammatory cytokines (tumor necrosis factor-?, interleukin-6 and interferon-?), which was quantified using ELISA showed that simvastatin decreased the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines to an average of 2-fold.\n Furthermore, the modulation of actin filament polymerization was determined using rhodamine staining.\n Endocytosis and autophagy processes were examined by detecting Rab and RhoA GTPase protein prenylation and LC3 lipidation using western blotting.\n The results showed that inhibiting GTPase and LC3 membrane localization using simvastatin inhibits influenza replication.\n Findings of this study provide evidence that modulation of RhoA, Rabs and LC3 may be the underlying mechanisms for the inhibitory effects of simvastatin as an anti-influenza compound.\n","id":"PMC4072341","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"D.A.

Patients Receiving Statins: A Cohort Study","abstract":"Background\nStatins possess immunomodulatory properties and have been proposed for reducing morbidity during an influenza pandemic.\n\n We sought to evaluate the effect of statins on hospitalizations and deaths related to seasonal influenza outbreaks.\n\n\nMethodology/Principal Findings\nWe conducted a population-based cohort study over 10 influenza seasons (1996 to 2006) using linked administrative databases in Ontario, Canada.\n\n We identified all adults older than 65 years who had received an influenza vaccination prior to the start of influenza season and distinguished those also prescribed statins (23%) from those not also prescribed statins (77%).\n\n Propensity-based matching, which accounted for each individual's likelihood of receiving a statin, yielded a final cohort of 2,240,638 patients, exactly half of whom received statins.\n\n Statins were associated with small protective effects against pneumonia hospitalization (odds ratio [OR] 0.92; 95% CI 0.89–0.95), 30-day pneumonia mortality (0.84; 95% CI 0.77–0.91), and all-cause mortality (0.87; 95% CI 0.84–0.89).\n\n These protective effects attenuated substantially after multivariate adjustment and when we excluded multiple observations for each individual, declined over time, differed across propensity score quintiles and risk groups, and were unchanged during post-influenza season periods.\n\n The main limitations of this study were the observational study design, the non-specific outcomes, and the lack of information on medications while hospitalized.\n\n\nConclusions/Significance\nStatin use is associated with a statistically significant but minimal protective effect against influenza morbidity that can easily be attributed to residual confounding.\n\n Public health officials and clinicians should focus on other measures to reduce morbidity and mortality from the next influenza pandemic.\n\n\n","id":"PMC2778952","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Public Library of Science","authors":[{"firstname":"Jeffrey

Signaling via TRIF Contributes to a Protective Innate Immune Response to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus Infection","abstract":"Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are sensors that recognize molecular patterns from viruses, bacteria, and fungi to initiate innate immune responses to invading pathogens.\n The emergence of highly pathogenic coronaviruses severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is a concern for global public health, as there is a lack of efficacious vaccine platforms and antiviral therapeutic strategies.\n Previously, it was shown that MyD88, an adaptor protein necessary for signaling by multiple TLRs, is a required component of the innate immune response to mouse-adapted SARS-CoV infection in vivo.\n Here, we demonstrate that TLR3?/?, TLR4?/?, and TRAM?/? mice are more susceptible to SARS-CoV than wild-type mice but experience only transient weight loss with no mortality in response to infection.\n In contrast, mice deficient in the TLR3/TLR4 adaptor TRIF are highly susceptible to SARS-CoV infection, showing increased weight loss, mortality, reduced lung function, increased lung pathology, and higher viral titers.\n Distinct alterations in inflammation were present in TRIF?/? mice infected with SARS-CoV, including excess infiltration of neutrophils and inflammatory cell types that correlate with increased pathology of other known causes of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), including influenza virus infections.\n Aberrant proinflammatory cytokine, chemokine, and interferon-stimulated gene (ISG) signaling programs were also noted following infection of TRIF?/? mice that were similar to those seen in human patients with poor disease outcome following SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV infection.\n These findings highlight the importance of TLR adaptor signaling in generating a balanced protective innate immune response to highly pathogenic coronavirus infections.\n","id":"PMC4447251","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"American Society of Microbiology","authors":[{"firstname":"Allison

Mouse-Adapted SARS-CoV","abstract":"A novel human coronavirus, SARS-CoV, emerged suddenly in 2003, causing approximately 8000 human cases and more than 700 deaths worldwide.\n Since most animal models fail to faithfully recapitulate the clinical course of SARS-CoV in humans, the virus and host factors that mediate disease pathogenesis remain unclear.\n Recently, our laboratory and others developed a recombinant mouse-adapted SARS-CoV (rMA15) that was lethal in BALB/c mice.\n In contrast, intranasal infection of young 10-week-old C57BL/6 mice with rMA15 results in a nonlethal infection characterized by high titer replication within the lungs, lung inflammation, destruction of lung tissue, and loss of body weight, thus providing a useful model to identify host mediators of protection.\n Here, we report that mice deficient in MyD88 (MyD88?/?), an adapter protein that mediates Toll-like receptor (TLR), IL-1R, and IL-18R signaling, are far more susceptible to rMA15 infection.\n The genetic absence of MyD88 resulted in enhanced pulmonary pathology and greater than 90% mortality by day 6 post-infection.\n MyD88?/? mice had significantly higher viral loads in lung tissue throughout the course of infection.\n Despite increased viral loads, the expression of multiple proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines within lung tissue and recruitment of inflammatory monocytes/macrophages to the lung was severely impaired in MyD88?/? mice compared to wild-type mice.\n Furthermore, mice deficient in chemokine receptors that contribute to monocyte recruitment to the lung were more susceptible to rMA15-induced disease and exhibited severe lung pathology similar to that seen in MyD88?/?mice.\n These data suggest that MyD88-mediated innate immune signaling and inflammatory cell recruitment to the lung are required for protection from lethal rMA15 infection.\n","id":"PMC2587915","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Public Library of

in lung adenocarcinoma cells exposed to hydrogen peroxide","abstract":"Lung cancer is characterized by a high mortality rate probably attributable to early metastasis.\n Oxidative stress is involved in development and progression of lung cancer, through cellular and molecular mechanisms which at least in part overlap with proinflammatory pathways.\n Simvastatin is a statin with pleiotropic effects that can also act as an anti-oxidant agent, and these pharmacologic properties may contribute to its potential anti-cancer activity.\n Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate, in the human lung adenocarcinoma cell line GLC-82, the effects of a 24-hour treatment with simvastatin on hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)-induced changes in cell viability, ERK phosphorylation, matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) expression, innate immunity signaling, NF-?B activation and IL-8 secretion.\n Cell counting was performed after trypan blue staining, cell proliferation was assessed using MTT assay, and apoptosis was evaluated through caspase-3 activation and Tunel assay.\n Western blotting was used to analyze protein extracts, and IL-8 release into cell culture supernatants was assessed by ELISA.\n Our results show that simvastatin (30 ?M) significantly (P &lt;0.01) inhibited the proliferative effect of H2O2 (0.5 mM) and its stimulatory actions on ERK1/2 phosphorylation, NF-?B activation and IL-8 production.\n Furthermore, simvastatin decreased H2O2-mediated induction of the cellular expression of MMP-2 and MMP-9, as well as of several components of the signaling complex activated by innate immune responses, including MyD88, TRAF2, TRAF6 and TRADD.\n In conclusion, these findings suggest that simvastatin could play a role in prevention and treatment of lung cancer via modulation of important proinflammatory and tumorigenic events promoted by oxidative stress.\n","id":"PMC4280703","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"BioMed

inhibit the proximal steps of cholesterol biosynthesis, and are linked to health benefits in various conditions, including cancer and lung disease.\n We have previously investigated apoptotic pathways triggered by statins in airway mesenchymal cells, and identified reduced prenylation of small GTPases as a primary effector mechanism leading to p53-mediated cell death.\n Here, we extend our studies of statin-induced cell death by assessing endpoints of both apoptosis and autophagy, and investigating their interplay and coincident regulation.\n Using primary cultured human airway smooth muscle (HASM) and human airway fibroblasts (HAF), autophagy, and autophagosome formation and flux were assessed by transmission electron microscopy, cytochemistry (lysosome number and co-localization with LC3) and immunoblotting (LC3 lipidation and Atg12-5 complex formation).\n Chemical inhibition of autophagy increased simvastatin-induced caspase activation and cell death.\n Similarly, Atg5 silencing with shRNA, thus preventing Atg5-12 complex formation, increased pro-apoptotic effects of simvastatin.\n Simvastatin concomitantly increased p53-dependent expression of p53 up-regulated modulator of apoptosis (PUMA), NOXA, and damage-regulated autophagy modulator (DRAM).\n Notably both mevalonate cascade inhibition-induced autophagy and apoptosis were p53 dependent: simvastatin increased nuclear p53 accumulation, and both cyclic pifithrin-? and p53 shRNAi partially inhibited NOXA, PUMA expression and caspase-3/7 cleavage (apoptosis) and DRAM expression, Atg5-12 complex formation, LC3 lipidation, and autophagosome formation (autophagy).\n Furthermore, the autophagy response is induced rapidly, significantly delaying apoptosis, suggesting the existence of a temporally coordinated p53 regulation network.\n These findings are relevant for the development of statin-based therapeutic approaches in obstructive airway disease.\n","id":"PMC3031577","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Public Library of

Function","abstract":"Angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) is a recently described homologue of the vasoactive peptidase, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE).\n Like ACE, ACE2 is an integral (type I) membrane zinc metallopeptidase, which exists as an ectoenzyme.\n ACE2 is less widely distributed than ACE in the body, being expressed at highest concentrations in the heart, kidney and testis.\n ACE2 also differs from ACE in its substrate specificity, functioning exclusively as a carboxypeptidase rather than a peptidyl dipeptidase.\n A key role for ACE2 appears to be emerging in the conversion of angiotensin II to angiotensin (1–7), allowing it to act as a counter-balance to the actions of ACE.\n ACE2 has been localised to the endothelial and epithelial cells of the heart and kidney where it may have a role at the cell surface in hydrolysing bioactive peptides such as angiotensin II present in the circulation.\n A role for ACE2 in the metabolism of other biologically active peptides also needs to be considered.\n ACE2 also serendipitously appears to act as a receptor for the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus.\n Studies using ace2\n-/- mice, and other emerging studies in vivo and in vitro, have revealed that ACE2 has important functions in cardiac regulation and diabetes.\n Together with its role as a SARS receptor, ACE2 is therefore likely to be an important therapeutic target in a diverse range of disease states.\n","id":"PMC7088140","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Kluwer Academic

human airway fibroblasts","abstract":"Background\nBronchial fibroblasts contribute to airway remodelling, including airway wall fibrosis.\n\n Transforming growth factor (TGF)-?1 plays a major role in this process.\n\n We previously revealed the importance of the mevalonate cascade in the fibrotic response of human airway smooth muscle cells.\n\n We now investigate mevalonate cascade-associated signaling in TGF?1-induced fibronectin expression by bronchial fibroblasts from non-asthmatic and asthmatic subjects.\n\n\nMethods\nWe used simvastatin (1-15 ?M) to inhibit 3-hydroxy-3-methlyglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase which converts HMG-CoA to mevalonate.\n\n Selective inhibitors of geranylgeranyl transferase-1 (GGT1; GGTI-286, 10 ?M) and farnesyl transferase (FT; FTI-277, 10 ?M) were used to determine whether GGT1 and FT contribute to TGF?1-induced fibronectin expression.\n\n In addition, we studied the effects of co-incubation with simvastatin and mevalonate (1 mM), geranylgeranylpyrophosphate (30 ?M) or farnesylpyrophosphate (30 ?M).\n\n\nResults\nImmunoblotting revealed concentration-dependent simvastatin inhibition of TGF?1 (2.5 ng/ml, 48 h)-induced fibronectin.\n\n This was prevented by exogenous mevalonate, or isoprenoids (geranylgeranylpyrophosphate or farnesylpyrophosphate).\n\n The effects of simvastatin were mimicked by GGTI-286, but not FTI-277, suggesting fundamental involvement of GGT1 in TGF?1-induced signaling.\n\n Asthmatic fibroblasts exhibited greater TGF?1-induced fibronectin expression compared to non-asthmatic cells; this enhanced response was effectively reduced by simvastatin.\n\n\nConclusions\nWe conclude that TGF?1-induced fibronectin expression in airway fibroblasts relies on activity of GGT1 and availability of isoprenoids.\n\n Our results suggest that targeting regulators of isoprenoid-dependent signaling holds promise for treating airway wall fibrosis.\n\n\n","id":"PMC3173339","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"BioMed

(IPF).\n\n This post hoc analysis assessed the effects of statin therapy on disease-related outcomes in IPF.\n\n\nMethods\nPatients randomised to placebo (n=624) in three controlled trials of pirfenidone in IPF (CAPACITY 004 and 006, ASCEND) were categorised by baseline statin use.\n\n Outcomes assessed during the 1-year follow-up included disease progression, mortality, hospitalisation and composite outcomes of death or ?10% absolute decline in FVC and death or ?50?m decline in 6-minute walk distance (6MWD).\n\n\nResults\nAt baseline, 276 (44%) patients were statin users versus 348 (56%) non-users.\n\n Baseline characteristics were similar between groups, except statin users were older and had higher prevalence of cardiovascular disease and risk factors.\n\n In multivariate analyses adjusting for differences in baseline characteristics, statin users had lower risks of death or 6MWD decline (HR 0.69; 95% CI 0.48 to 0.99, p=0.0465), all-cause hospitalisation (HR 0.58; 95%

characterized by the formation of scar tissue within the lungs in the absence of any known provocation.\n IPF is a rare disease which affects approximately 5 million persons worldwide.\n The prevalence is estimated to be slightly greater in men (20.2/100,000) than in women (13.2/100,000).\n The mean age at presentation is 66 years.\n IPF initially manifests with symptoms of exercise-induced breathless and dry coughing.\n Auscultation of the lungs reveals early inspiratory crackles, predominantly located in the lower posterior lung zones upon physical exam.\n Clubbing is found in approximately 50% of IPF patients.\n Cor pulmonale develops in association with end-stage disease.\n In that case, classic signs of right heart failure may be present.\n Etiology remains incompletely understood.\n Some environmental factors may be associated with IPF (cigarette smoking, exposure to silica and livestock).\n IPF is recognized on high-resolution computed tomography by peripheral, subpleural lower lobe reticular opacities in association with subpleural honeycomb changes.\n IPF is associated with a pathological lesion known as usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP).\n The UIP pattern consists of normal lung alternating with patches of dense fibrosis, taking the form of collagen sheets.\n The diagnosis of IPF requires correlation of the clinical setting with radiographic images and a lung biopsy.\n In the absence of lung biopsy, the diagnosis of IPF can be made by defined clinical criteria that were published in guidelines endorsed by several professional societies.\n Differential diagnosis includes other idiopathic interstitial pneumonia, connective tissue diseases (systemic sclerosis, polymyositis, rheumatoid arthritis), forme fruste of autoimmune disorders, chronic hypersensitivity pneumonitis and other environmental (sometimes occupational) exposures.\n IPF is typically progressive and leads to significant disability.\n The median survival is 2 to 5 years from the time of diagnosis.\n Medical therapy is ineffective in the treatment of IPF.\n New molecular therapeutic targets have been identified and several clinical trials are investigating the efficacy of novel medication.\n Meanwhile, pulmonary transplantation remains a viable option for patients with IPF.\n It is expected that, during the next decade, considerable progress will be made toward the understanding and treatment of this devastating illness.\n","id":"PMC2330030","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"BioMed

differed significantly with 66 months for patients without comorbidities, 48 months when 1–3 comorbidities were reported and 35 months when 4–7 comorbidities were prevalent (p = 0.004).\n\n A multivariate Cox proportional hazard analyses identified other cardiac diseases and lung cancer as significant predictors of death, gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and diastolic dysfunction

Outcomes of 2019-Coronavirus Disease Patients: A Retrospective Study\nBackground: Statins have multiple protective effects on inflammation, immunity and coagulation, and may help alleviate pneumonia. However, there was no report focusing on the association of statin use with in-hospital outcomes of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). We investigated the association between the use of statins and in-hospital outcomes of patients with COVID-19.\nMethods: In this retrospective case series, consecutive COVID-19 patients admitted at 2 hospitals in Wuhan, China, from March 12, 2020 to April 14, 2020 were analyzed. A 1:1 matched cohort was created by propensity score-matched analysis. Demographic data, laboratory findings, comorbidities, treatments and in-hospital outcomes were collected and compared between COVID-19 patients taking and not taking statins.\nResult: A total of 2,147 patients with COVID-19 were enrolled in this study. Of which, 250 patients were on statin therapy. The mortality was 2.4% (6/250) for patients taking statins while 3.7% (70/1,897) for those not taking statins. In the multivariate Cox model, after adjusting for age, gender, admitted hospital, comorbidities, in-hospital medications and blood lipids, the risk was lower for mortality (adjusted HR, 0.428; 95% CI, 0.169-0.907; P = 0.029), acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (adjusted HR, 0.371; 95% CI, 0.180-0.772; P = 0.008) or intensive care unit (ICU) care (adjusted HR, 0.319; 95% CI, 0.270-0.945; P = 0.032) in the statin group vs. the non-statin group. After propensity score-matched analysis based on 18 potential confounders, a 1:1 matched cohort (206:206) was created. In the matched cohort, the Kaplan-Meier survival curves showed that the use of statins was associated with better survival (P = 0.025). In a Cox regression model, the use of statins was associated with lower risk of mortality (unadjusted HR, 0.254; 95% CI, 0.070-0.926; P = 0.038), development of ARDS (unadjusted HR, 0.240; 95% CI, 0.087-0.657; P = 0.006), and admission of ICU (unadjusted HR, 0.349; 95% CI, 0.150-0.813; P = 0.015). The results remained consistent when being adjusted for age, gender, total cholesterol, triglyceride, low density lipoprotein cholesterol, procalcitonin, and brain natriuretic peptide. The favorable outcomes in statin users remained statistically significant in the first sensitivity analysis with comorbid diabetes being excluded in matching and in the second sensitivity analysis with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease being added in matching.\nConclusion: In this retrospective analysis, the use of statins in COVID-19 patients was associated with better clinical outcomes and is recommended to be continued in patients with COVID-19.\nIntroduction\nCoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has already been a global pandemic since early December 2019. Since then, infection with COVID-19 has rapidly spread throughout the world, even causing widespread social and economic disruption. At the time of submission, the total number of infected patients has risen to 43, 251, 698 around the world, with 1,154,214 associated deaths. However, thus far, there are no specific therapies or vaccines available for COVID-19. Most of the currently used clinical interventions are symptomatic supportive therapies, which have exhibited limited therapeutic effects for COVID-19.\nIt is worth noticing that patients with common comorbidities, including hypertension and cardiovascular diseases are at greater risk for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and its related acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and mortality. Most of these patients are taking statins routinely based on cardiovascular guidelines. Statins, as one of the inhibitors of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase (HMG-CoA), are a class of lipid-lowering medications and are frequently used in patients with cardiovascular diseases or to prevent cardiovascular events. Statins are also well-known for their potential immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory effects in pneumonia. An earlier retrospective cohort study showed that, in bacterial pneumonia patients, in-hospital mortality was significantly reduced after using statins. Many researchers have focused on statins in the treatment of infections. In 2014, some researchers suggested that statins might be used for treatment of patients with Ebola virus disease. Although most of these studies argue that statins are advantageous to outcomes and prognosis of patients with pneumonia, Fernandez et al. demonstrated that hospital mortality was significantly higher after statin therapy. Therefore, whether statin use was associated with reduced mortality for patients with pneumonia is still in debate. To the best of our knowledge, there is no clinical or experimental data focusing on the effects of statin use on the in-hospital outcomes of COVID-19 patients. The main purpose of the present study was to investigate the association of the statin use with the in-hospital outcomes of COVID-19 patients.\nMethods\nStudy Design and Participants\nThis retrospective study was performed at Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University and Leishenshan Hospital in Wuhan, China, which were designated hospitals to treat patients with COVID-19. Leishenshan Hospital was taken over by Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University during the epidemic period. The inclusion criteria included patients with COVID-19 who were admitted to the 2 hospitals from March 12, 2020 to April 14, 2020 and who were either discharged with following recovery or died during hospitalization. The exclusion criteria included incomplete medical records, loss of follow-up due to being transferred to other hospitals and discontinuation of use of statins. COVID-19 was diagnosed according to the interim guidance of the World Health Organization. The treatment strategies for COVID-19 in the 2 hospitals were based on Chinese Guideline of Clinical Management for COVID-19 (1st-7th version). Patients with critical illness (severe respiratory failure, shock, and multiple organ dysfunction) were transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU). This study complied with the edicts of the 1975 Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the institutional ethics board of Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University (No. 2020026). The patients' consents were obtained from individual participant or their relatives.\nData Collection\nThe electronic medical records of the patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection by real-time reverse-transcription PCR (RT-PCR) were extracted and reviewed by a trained team of physicians from the 2 hospitals during the epidemic period. The data including demographics, medical history, laboratory examinations, comorbidities, complications, treatments, and outcomes were collected and analyzed. The researchers were responsible to contact the patients or their families in case of uncertainties about the data to ensure to maximum the accuracy of our data.\nIn-hospital Outcomes\nThe main in-hospital outcomes included COVID-19 related death or discharge. Successful treatment toward hospital cure for the patients with COVID-19 comprised all of the following criteria: relieved clinical symptoms, normal body temperature, significant resolution of inflammation as shown by chest radiography and at least 2 consecutive negative results assessed by RT-PCR assay for SARS-Cov-2. The secondary outcomes included development of ARDS and requirement of ICU care. The definition of ARDS required bilateral infiltrates on chest radiograph consistent with pulmonary edema and partial pressure of arterial oxygen/fraction of inspired oxygen &lt;300 mmHg.\nPropensity Score-Matched (PSM) Analysis and Sensitivity Analysis\nTo validate the findings, propensity score-matched (PSM) cohort was created based on 18 baseline variables which were expected to be potential confounders. Statin and non-statin users were paired according to the propensity scores using nearest matching with a caliper size of 0.05. The balance of covariates was evaluated by estimating standardized differences (SD) and p-values before and after matching, and SD absolute value &lt;0.1 was considered perfect balancing between the two groups. The imbalanced variables with SD &gt;= 0.1 in PSM analysis were adjusted in the following multivariate Cox model.\nWe performed two sensitivity analyses to evaluate the robustness of propensity score-matched cohort analyses. In the first sensitivity analysis, comorbid diabetes was not excluded in matching. In the second sensitivity analysis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) was added in matching.\nStatistical Analysis\nCategorical variables are shown as frequencies and percentages, and continuous variables as mean +- standard deviation, or median (interquartile range). The means for continuous variables were compared using independent group t-tests when the data were normally distributed, otherwise, the Mann-Whitney U-test was used. Proportions for categorical variables were compared using the X2-test, although Fisher's exact test was used when data were limited. A Kaplan-Meier plot was used for survival data. We compared the in-hospital outcomes of patients who did and did not use statins by using Cox proportional hazards models to calculate hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals. In the unmatched cohort, the variables which were considered to confound the association of statin use with the clinical outcome were adjusted for in the Cox regression model. Additionally, we adjusted for imbalanced variables with SD &gt;= 0.1 in PSM analysis in following multivariate Cox model. All statistical analyses were performed with SPSS19.0 for Windows. A two-tailed P &lt; 0.05 was considered statistically significant.\nResults\nDemographics Data\nA total of 2,351 consecutive patients hospitalized with COVID-19 who were successfully treated and discharged or died at Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University or Leishenshan Hospital from March 12 to April 14, 2020 were analyzed (Figure 1). By reviewing all electronic medical records, 128 patients with incomplete data, 55 patients who were on statins prior to admission but interrupted after admission and 21 patients who had been transferred to other hospitals and lost follow-up were excluded. Finally, 2,147 patients with COVID-19 were enrolled in this study. Of which, 250 patients were on statins prior to admission and continued their use during hospitalization including 162 (64.8%) atorvastatin (20 mg every day) and 75 (30.0%) rosuvastatin (10 mg every day), and the remaining 13 (5.2%) patients used other statins such as pravastatin. The remaining 1,897 patients never used statins.\nThe flowchart showing the strategy of participant enrollment COVID-19, coronavirus disease 2019.\nClinical Characteristics on Admission Before and After PSM Analysis\nThe comorbid coronary heart disease, hypertension, diabetes, cerebrovascular diseases were more frequent in the statin users than the non-statin users (Table 1). Many laboratory results including neutrophil count, prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin time, D-dimer, total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride, low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), procalcitonin, creatine kinase-MB, high-sensitivity troponin I (hs-TnI), and brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) showed significant (p &lt; 0.05) or marginal significant (p &lt; 0.10) differences between the two groups on admission (Table 2). Since many significantly imbalanced variables existed in the baseline state on admission, the outcomes could not be directly compared between the two groups. Then the PSM analysis was conducted to account for these 18 potential confounding factors (Supplementary Table 1). A new cohort of patients were matched in the statin group vs. non-statin group at a ratio of 1:1 with 206 patients in each group. In the matched cohort, all the variables in Table 1 did not show significant differences (all p &gt; 0.05), however, the variables with SD &gt; 0.1 including TC, triglyceride, LDL-C, procalcitonin, and BNP did not achieve a perfect matching, therefore, along with age and sex, these variables entered in the multivariate COX model for adjustment (Table 3).

In the multivariate Cox model, after adjusting for age, gender, admitted hospital, comorbidities (hypertension, coronary heart disease, diabetes, cerebrovascular diseases), in-hospital medications (ACEI/ARB, glucocorticoid) and blood lipids (TC, LDL-C), statin use was associated with lower mortality (adjusted HR, 0.428; 95% CI, 0.169-0.907; P = 0.029), ARDS (adjusted HR, 0.371; 95% CI, 0.180-0.772; P = 0.008) or ICU care (adjusted HR, 0.319; 95% CI, 0.270-0.945; P = 0.032) vs. non-statin use.\nIn the matched cohort, as shown in the Kaplan-Meier survival curves, the use of statins was associated with better survival (P = 0.025; Figure 2). In a Cox regression model, the use of statins was associated with lower risk of in-hospital mortality (unadjusted HR, 0.254; 95% CI, 0.070-0.926; P = 0.038), development of ARDS (unadjusted HR, 0.240; 95% CI, 0.087-0.657; P = 0.006), and admission of ICU (unadjusted HR, 0.349; 95% CI, 0.150-0.813; P = 0.015). The results remained consistent when being adjusted for age, gender, TC, triglyceride, LDL-C, procalcitonin, and BNP (Table 3).\nKaplan-Meier survival curves of 412 COVID-19 patients with and without taking statins (206:206) after propensity score-matched analysis. COVID-19, coronavirus disease 2019.\nSensitivity Analyses\nAdditional sensitivity analyses aiming to further assess the robustness of the association between statin use and outcomes were performed, the results remained consistent and statistically significant in the first sensitivity analysis with comorbid diabetes being excluded in matching and in the second sensitivity analysis with COPD being added in matching (Supplementary Table 2).\nDiscussion\nMain Findings\nThe present study demonstrated for the first time that, the continuous use of statins was associated with lower mortality, less development of ARDS and less requirement of ICU care. Even after matched or adjusted for the blood lipids, the results remained consistently significant, indicating that this association was independent of its lipid-lowering effect.\nAssociation of the Statin Use With the In-hospital Outcomes for Patients With COVID-19\nThe observations regarding the association of statin use with the outcomes of types of pneumonia had been reported previously. Overall, significant decrease in mortality was demonstrated in the hospitalized pneumonia patients taking statins. A previous retrospective cohort study showed that statin use was associated with a decreased risk of mortality in patients hospitalized with community-acquired pneumonia. In another study, continuous use of statins was also correlated with a decreased risk of mortality or intubation in patients with COPD Consistent with above observations, we found a decrease in mortality, less development of ARDS, and less requirement of ICU care in patients with continuous use of statins during their hospitalization for COVID-19.\nThe current study further showed some laboratory indicators reflecting inflammation (C-reactive protein, procalcitonin) and myocardial injury (hs-TNI, BNP) on admission could not be perfectly matched by PSM analysis. They might be still resistant confounders which had been adjusted in the following multivariate Cox model. However, there is another possibility that, they might be mediators. Due to routine use of statins before admission, the pharmacological actions of statins on COVID-19 patients may be already significant since the patients were initially infected with COVID-19. This postulation might be supported by the findings of elevated alanine transaminase and creatine kinase and decreased calcium concentration on admission, which were frequently-observed side effects in long-term use of statins, especially in those with complications of liver injury and rhabdomyolysis.\nPossible Mechanisms for the Association Between Statin Use and Favorable Outcomes of COVID-19\nThe potential benefits of statins for patients with COVID-19 are presumably related to their multiple effects. In addition to their benefits in patients with cardiovascular or cerebrovascular diseases, the pleiotropic effects including anti-inflammatory, anti-thrombotic, immunomodulatory, and reducing reactive oxygen species have also been reported. The evidence for the anti-inflammatory properties of statins in the lung and their potential role as novel treatments for respiratory diseases have been noticed. Our findings were consistent with these reports and demonstrated that the use of statins was associated with less development of ARDS. This association was beyond its lipid-lowering effect.\nIncreased level of angiotensin II was observed in COVID-19-affected individuals, which was demonstrated to be correlated with viral load and severity of illness of COVID-19. As the isoenzyme of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE), ACE2 plays a protective role in generating angiotensin-(1-7) (Ang 1-7) from angiotensin II in renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS). When patients are infected with SARS-CoV-2, their ACE2 is further down-regulated by binding it with SARS-CoV-2 resulting in a deterioration of the imbalance of ACE2/ACE, and subsequently induces a sharp release of AngII by over-activation of RAAS. The upregulation of ACE2 by the use of statins was reported previously, and may be another important mechanism of statin benefits for COVID-19. However, the exact mechanisms underlying the association between statin use and in-hospital outcomes need to be validated by further experimental studies and clinical observations.\nComparisons to Other Studies\nStatins are well-known for their anti-inflammatory effects, and some hospitals included them in the COVID-19 treatment protocol. However, whether statin use was associated with reduced mortality for patients with COVID-19 is still in debate. Especially, some scholars have an opinion that statins should be used with caution in COVID-19 patients because it could cause myalgia, myopathies, or rhabdomyolysis, thereby exacerbating the disease, yet it should be noted that both of statin induced myopathies and the deterioration of SARSCoV-2 infection are characterized as elder, and liver and kidney dysfunction. Thus, it is hard to differentiate the appearance of myalgia, rhabdomyolysis, increased creatine phosphokinase, and acute kidney injury in COVID-19 from statin therapy. Furthermore, there were other studies showed that COVID-19 patients could not benefit from the administration of statin. This discrepancy may result from the limited sample size and the heterogeneity of study population. Such as in the study from Dreher et al. only 50 patients with COVID-19 were included, and in the case series of 1,000 COVID-19 patients, they included all mild-to-critical patients with tested positive for COVID-19. Nevertheless, a retrospective analysis of 154 COVID-19 patients reported that the use of statin could significantly reduce the severity of COVID-19 among nursing home residents, which is consistent with our findings. Overall, based on our results, continuation of statin therapy among COVID-19 patients with a history of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease or diabetes was recommended.\nStudy Limitations\nOur study has several limitations. First, with all the limitations of a retrospective study and relatively small sample size, further randomized prospective studies with more patients are required to verify the findings in our study. However, the propensity score-matched analysis, sensitivity analyses, and multivariate Cox model have been further conducted to limit potential bias or exclude possible confounders. The results from these analyses showed consistent findings and strengthened our conclusion. Even so, a cause-and-effect relationship between statins and survival cannot be inferred and only an association between statins and favorable outcomes was reported in the present study. Second, some specific information regarding cardiovascular complications and inflammation such as echocardiography and interleukin-6 were not included in the study due to the limited conditions in the isolation ward and the urgency of constraining the COVID-19 epidemic.\nConclusion\nThe continuous use of statins was associated with favorable outcomes in patients with COVID-19. The statin use is recommended to be continued in patients with COVID-19. However, given that this study was a retrospective analysis, further prospective studies and randomized clinical trials are warranted to verify the beneficial effect of statin in COVID-19 patients and in its different subgroups.\nData Availability Statement\nThe original contributions presented in the study are included in the article/Supplementary Material, further inquiries can be directed to the corresponding author/s.\nEthics Statement\nThis study was approved by the Institutional Ethics Board of Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University (No. 2020026).

Of six family members who travelled to Wuhan, five were identified as infected with the novel coronavirus.\n\n Additionally, one family member, who did not travel to Wuhan, became infected with the virus after several days of contact with four of the family members.\n\n None of the family members had contacts with Wuhan markets or animals, although two had visited a Wuhan hospital.\n\n Five family members (aged 36–66 years) presented with fever, upper or lower respiratory tract symptoms, or diarrhoea, or a combination of these 3–6 days after exposure.\n\n They presented to our hospital (The University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen) 6–10 days after symptom onset.\n\n They and one asymptomatic child (aged 10 years) had radiological ground-glass lung opacities.\n\n Older patients (aged &gt;60 years) had more systemic symptoms, extensive radiological ground-glass lung changes, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and increased C-reactive protein and lactate dehydrogenase levels.\n\n The nasopharyngeal or throat swabs of these six patients were negative for known respiratory microbes by point-of-care multiplex RT-PCR, but five patients (four adults and the child) were RT-PCR positive for genes encoding the internal RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and surface Spike protein of this novel coronavirus, which were confirmed by Sanger sequencing.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these five patients' RT-PCR amplicons and two full genomes by next-generation sequencing showed that this is a novel coronavirus, which is closest to the bat severe acute respiatory syndrome

outcomes in patients with a number of different malignancies.\n\n The objective of this study was to assess the relationship between NLR and mortality in a population of adult critically ill patients.\n\n\nMethods\nWe performed an observational cohort study of unselected intensive care unit (ICU) patients based on records in a large clinical database.\n\n We computed individual patient NLR and categorized patients by quartile of this ratio.\n\n The association of NLR quartiles and 28-day mortality was assessed using multivariable logistic regression.\n\n Secondary outcomes included mortality in the ICU, in-hospital mortality and 1-year mortality.\n\n An a priori subgroup analysis of patients with versus without sepsis was performed to assess any differences in the relationship

Bacterial Infections – A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis","abstract":"Background\nSeveral studies have reported improved survival in severe bacterial infections among statin treated patients.\n\n In addition, statins have been ascribed beneficial anti-inflammatory effects.\n\n The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of statin-treatment on mortality in patients with bacterial infections, by means of a systematic review and a meta-analysis.\n\n\nMethodology and Principal Findings\nStudies investigating the association between statin use and mortality in patients with bacterial disease were identified in a systematic literature review and a meta-analysis was performed to calculate the overall odds ratio of mortality in statin users.\n\n The literature search identified 947 citations from which 40 relevant studies were extracted.\n\n In all, 15 studies comprising 113 910 patients were included in the final analysis.\n\n Statin use was associated with a significantly (p&lt;0.0001) reduced mortality in patients suffering from bacterial infections (OR 0.52, 95% CI 0.42–0.66).\n\n However, all studies included were of observational design and funnel plot analyses indicated influence by a possible publication bias (Egger's bias test p&lt;0.05).\n\n When a precision estimate test was used to adjust for publication bias the effect of statin treatment was no longer significant, with an OR of 0.79 (95% CI 0.58–1.07).\n\n\nConclusion/Significance\nAccording to the meta-analysis of observational studies presented here, patients on statin therapy seem to have a better outcome in bacterial infections.\n\n However, the association did not reach statistical significance after adjustment for apparent publication bias.\n\n Thus, there is a great need for randomised controlled trials investigating the possible beneficial effect of statins in bacterial infections.\n\n\n","id":"PMC2873291","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Public Library of

Fatal outcomes of H7N9 infections are often attributed to the severe pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).\n There is urgent need to discover biomarkers predicting the progression of disease and fatal outcome of potentially lethal flu infections, based on sound statistical analysis.\n We discovered that 34 of the 48 cytokines and chemokines examined in this study were significantly elevated in the plasma samples from patients infected with H7N9. We report for the first time that the levels of MIF, SCF, MCP-1, HGF, and SCGF-? are highly positively linked to disease severity and the profile of mediators MIF, SCF, MCP-1, HGF, SCGF-?, IP-10,

are gender related, with more symptoms in males than in females.\n\n However, the underlying mechanisms are not well understood.\n\n In this study, we investigated sex differences in renal vascular responses to angiotensin II (Ang II) administration with and without Ang II type 1 and Mas receptor (AT1R and MasR) antagonists (losartan and A779) in the 2K1C rat model of renovascular hypertension.\n\n \nMethods\n Male and female 2K1C rats were divided into 8 experimental groups (4 of each sex) treated with vehicle, losartan, A779, or A779+losartan.\n\n Responses of mean arterial pressure (MAP), renal blood flow (RBF), and renal vascular resistance (RVR) to Ang II were determined.\n\n \nResults\n In both sexes, the basal MAP, RBF, and RVR were not significantly different between the four groups during the control period.\n\n The Ang II administration decreased RBF and increased RVR in a dose-related manner in both sexes pretreated with vehicle or A779 (Pdose &lt; 0.0001), but in vehicle pretreated groups, RBF and RVR responses were different between male and female rats (Pgroup &lt; 0.05).\n\n AT1R blockade increased RBF and decreased RVR responses to Ang II, and no difference between the sexes was detected.\n\n Coblockades of AT1R and MasR receptors increased RBF response to Ang II significantly in males alone but not in females (Pgroup=0.04).\n\n \nConclusion\n The impact of Ang II on RBF and RVR responses seems to be gender related with a greater effect on males, and this sex difference abolishes by Mas receptor blockade.\n\n However, the paradoxical role of dual losartan and A779 may provide the different receptor interaction in RAS between male and female rats.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7914082","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Hindawi","authors":[{"firstname":"Zahra","surname":"Pezeshki","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Mehdi","surname":"Nematbakhsh","email":"nematbakhsh@med.mui.ac.ir","contributions":"6"},{"firstname":"Mehdi","surname":"Nematbakhsh","email":"nematbakhsh@med.mui.ac.ir","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1113/jphysiol.2001.012921","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Differential

vasodilatation.\n However, the effects of supraphysiological levels of estrogen, analogous to those achieved with high-dose estrogen replacement therapy in postmenopausal women, remain unknown.\n Therefore, we pretreated ovariectomized rats with a relatively high dose of estrogen (0.5?mg/kg/week) for two weeks.\n Subsequently, renal hemodynamic responses to intravenous angiotensin II (Ang II, 30–300?ng/kg/min) were tested under anesthesia, while renal perfusion pressure was held constant.\n The role of AT2R was examined by pretreating groups of rats with PD123319 or its vehicle.\n Renal blood flow (RBF) decreased in a dose-related manner in response to Ang II.\n Responses to Ang II were enhanced by pretreatment with estradiol.\n For example, at 300?ng?kg?1?min?1, Ang II reduced RBF by 45.7 ± 1.9% in estradiol-treated rats but only by 27.3 ± 5.1% in vehicle-treated rats.\n Pretreatment with PD123319 blunted the response of RBF to Ang II in estradiol-treated rats, so that reductions in RBF were similar to those in rats not treated with estradiol.\n We conclude that supraphysiological levels of estrogen promote AT2R-mediated renal vasoconstriction.\n This mechanism could potentially contribute to the increased risk of cardiovascular disease associated with hormone replacement therapy using high-dose estrogen.\n

Hypertensive Rats Treated with High Dose of Estradiol: The Role of Mas Receptor","abstract":"Backgrounds\n High blood pressure is one of the most important causes of death around the world.\n\n The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) and estradiol are two important items that regulate arterial blood pressure in women.\n\n However, hypertension, RAS, and sex hormone estradiol may influence renal vascular responses.\n\n This study was designed to determine the role of Mas receptor (MasR) on renal vascular response to angiotensin II (Ang II) administration in two kidneys-one clip (2K1C) hypertensive rats treated with estradiol.\n\n \nMethod\n The ovariectomized rats were subjected to 2K1C or non-2K1C and simultaneously treated with estradiol (500??g/kg/weekly) or placebo for a period of 4 weeks.\n\n Subsequently, under anesthesia, renal vascular responses to graded doses of Ang II administration with MasR blockade (A779) or its vehicle were determined.\n\n \nResults\n A779 or its vehicle did not alter mean arterial pressure (MAP), renal perfusion pressure (RPP), and renal blood flow (RBF).\n\n However, in non-2K1C rats, Ang II infusion decreased RBF and increased renal vascular resistance (RVR) responses in a dose-related manner (Ptreat &lt; 0.0001).\n\n The greatest responses were found in ovariectomized estradiol-treated rats that received A779 (Pgroup &lt; 0.05) in non-2K1C rats.\n\n Such findings were not detected in 2K1C hypertensive rats.\n\n For example, in estradiol-treated rats that received A779, at 1000?ng/kg/min of Ang II infusion, RBF reduced from 1.6 ± 0.2 to 0.89 ± 0.19?ml/min in non-2K1C rats, and it reduced from 1.6 ± 0.2 to 1.2 ± 0.2?ml/min in 2K1C rats.\n\n \nConclusion\n Hypertension induced by 2K1C may attenuate the role of A779 and estradiol in renal vascular responses to Ang II infusion.\n\n Perhaps, this response can be explained by the reduction of Ang II type 1 receptor (AT1R) expression in the 2K1C hypertensive rats.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7943267","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Hindawi","authors":[{"firstname":"Samira","surname":"Choopani","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Mehdi","surname":"Nematbakhsh","email":"nematbakhsh@med.mui.ac.ir","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Mehdi","surname":"Nematbakhsh","email":"nematbakhsh@med.mui.ac.ir","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1155/2015/801053","date":"2015-08-12","title":"Role

the heart and kidney during the development of hypertension and its perinatal treatment with losartan in young spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR).\n Expressions of RAS genes were studied by the RT-PCR in the left ventricle and kidney of rats: normotensive Wistar, untreated SHR, SHR treated with losartan since perinatal period until week 9 of age (20 mg/kg/day) and SHR treated with losartan

In the hypertrophied left ventricle of SHR, cardiac expressions of Ace and Mas were decreased while those of AT1 receptor (Agtr1a) and Ace2 were unchanged.\n Continuous losartan administration reduced LV weight (0.43 ± 0.02; P &lt; 0.05 versus SHR) but did not influence altered cardiac RAS expression.\n Increased blood pressure in SHR (149 ± 2 in SHR versus 109 ± 2 mmHg in Wistar; P &lt; 0.05) was associated with a lower renal expressions of renin, Agtr1a and Mas and with an increase in ACE2. Continuous losartan administration lowered blood pressure to control levels (105 ± 3 mmHg; P &lt; 0.05 versus SHR), however, only renal renin and ACE2 were significantly up-regulated (for both P &lt; 0.05 versus SHR).\n Conclusively, prevention of hypertension and LV hypertrophy development by losartan was unrelated to cardiac or renal expression of Mas.\n Increased renal Ace2, and its further increase by losartan suggests the influence of locally generated Ang-(1-7) in organ response to the developing hypertension in SHRs.\n","id":"PMC4549047","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd","authors":[{"firstname":"Jan","surname":"Klimas","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Michael","surname":"Olvedy","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Katarina","surname":"Ochodnicka-Mackovicova","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Peter","surname":"Kruzliak","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Sona","surname":"Cacanyiova","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Frantisek","surname":"Kristek","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Peter","surname":"Krenek","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Peter","surname":"Ochodnicky","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"10.1161/01.HYP.0000146400.57221.74","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Upregulation of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 by all-trans retinoic acid in spontaneously hypertensive rats","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1038/nature00786","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 is an essential regulator of heart function","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1152/ajprenal.00383.2009","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Reciprocal changes in renal ACE/ANG II and ACE2/ANG 1-7 are associated with enhanced collecting duct renin in Goldblatt hypertensive rats","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1113/expphysiol.2007.041392","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Role of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 and angiotensin(1-7) in 17beta-oestradiol regulation of renal pathology in renal wrap hypertension in rats","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.104.510461","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Effect of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition and angiotensin II receptor blockers on cardiac angiotensin-converting enzyme 2","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1111/j.1523-1755.2005.00675.x","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Effects of renin-angiotensin system blockade on renal angiotensin-(1-7) forming enzymes and receptors","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1152/ajpcell.00409.2004","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Distinct roles for ANG II and ANG-(1-7) in the regulation of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 in rat astrocytes","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]}]},{"doi":"10.1016/j.bcp.2014.11.013","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Tissue specific up regulation of ACE2 in rabbit model of atherosclerosis by atorvastatin: role of epigenetic histone modifications","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[],"References depth 2":[]},{"doi":"10.1016/j.dsx.2020.07.011","date":"2020-07-08","title":"Pros and cons for use of statins in people with coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19)","abstract":"Background and aims\nMorbidity and mortality from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is higher among people with diabetes mellitus (DM), hypertension, and cardiovascular disease (CVD).\n\n Statins are used in the majority of people with DM and CVD.\n\n This mini-review discusses the current understanding of benefit-risk ratio of use of statins in COVID-19.\nMethods\nWe searched PubMed database using specific keywords related to our aims till June 12, 2020.

The outcomes were (1) serious COVID-19 defined as long-stay hospital admission or death within 14 days of disease onset, and (2) asymptomatic (ie, no disease symptoms in the whole study period while still being diagnosed by polymerase chain reaction).\n\n\nSetting and participants\nA total of 154 COVID-19–positive subjects were identified, residing in 1 of 2 Belgian nursing homes that experienced similar COVID-19 outbreaks.\n\n\nMeasures\nLogistic regression models were applied with age, sex, functional status, diabetes, and hypertension as covariates.\n\n\nResults\nWe found a statistically significant association between statin intake and the absence of symptoms during COVID-19 (odds ratio [OR] 2.91; confidence interval [CI] 1.27–6.71), which remained statistically significant after adjusting for covariates (OR 2.65; CI 1.13–6.68).\n\n Although the effects of statin intake on serious clinical outcome were in the same beneficial direction, these were not statistically significant (OR 0.75; CI 0.24–1.87).\n\n There was also no statistically significant association between ACEi/ARB and asymptomatic status (OR 2.72; CI 0.59–25.1) or serious clinical outcome (OR 0.48; CI 0.10–1.97).\n\n\nConclusions and Implications\nOur data indicate that statin intake in older, frail adults could be associated with a considerable beneficial effect on COVID-19 clinical symptoms.\n\n The role of statins and renin-angiotensin system drugs needs to be further explored in larger observational studies as well as randomized clinical trials.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7294267","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"AMDA - The Society for Post-Acute and Long-Term Care Medicine.","authors":[{"firstname":"Anton","surname":"De

After adjustment for age, sex, ethnicity, socioeconomic status and comorbidities, statin exposure was not associated with a significantly different risk of mortality (HR 0.96 (95% CI 0.78 to 1.18); 30-day standardised absolute risk (SAR), 9.8% (8.7% to 11.0%) vs 9.5% (8.2% to 10.8%); SAR difference, -0.4% (-1.9% to 1.2%)), severe COVID-19 infection (HR 1.16 (95% CI 0.95 to 1.41); 30-day SAR, 13.0% (11.8% to 14.2%) vs 14.9% (12.8% to 17.1%); SAR difference, 1.9% (-0.7% to 4.5%)), and the composite outcome of all-cause mortality or severe COVID-19 infection (HR 1.05 (95% CI 0.89 to 1.23); 30-day SAR, 17.6% (16.4% to 18.8%) vs 18.2% (16.4% to 20.1%); SAR difference, 0.6% (-1.6% to 2.9%)).

Governments worldwide have imposed comprehensive measures to prevent the rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2, including extensive societal lockdown and reorganisation of healthcare systems. Recently, an observational study demonstrated that in-hospital use of statins was associated with substantial improvement in survival among patients hospitalised with COVID-19. Specifically, the authors reported a relative risk reduction of 42% in in-hospital mortality with statin therapy. This finding may be biased by patient selection, treatment indication and residual confounding and therefore merits further investigation. In addition, a computer-based study suggested that rosuvastatin may be effective in the treatment of COVID-19 infection. However, other observational studies, including a meta-analysis, did not find any association between statins and improved outcomes in patients with COVID-19.\nSeveral mechanisms by which statins may exert their potential beneficial effects have been proposed. First, the case fatality rate with COVID-19 infection is substantially higher in patients with established cardiovascular disease and diabetes than those without, and there is evidence of cardiac involvement and myocardial injury in some patients with COVID-19. Given their potential cardioprotective effects, statins may possibly prevent myocardial injury and adverse cardiovascular events, particularly in patients with established cardiovascular disease. Second, beyond their lipid-lowering properties, statins exert various beneficial pleiotropic effects, including modulating the immune response at different levels, improving endothelial function, and decreasing oxidative stress and inflammation. Third, some randomised clinical trials and observational studies:but not all:have indicated that statins may be associated with less severe infection and improved outcomes in patients with viral infections. On the other hand, experimental studies have suggested that statins, among other drugs, may increase the expression of ACE2, a membrane-bound aminopeptidase expressed in the lungs, heart and other tissues that is thought to facilitate entry of SARS-CoV-2 into the cells. Also, case series have reported hypercholesterolaemia to be one of the most common comorbidities in patients with COVID-19. These considerations have led to the concern that statins may confer a predisposition to more severe infection and adverse outcomes during COVID-19 infection. Taken together, the effect of statins on outcomes in patients with COVID-19 infection remains unclear.\nIn light of these uncertainties, it is important to assess whether statin therapy may improve the clinical course of patients with COVID-19 infection or lead to further deterioration. To address this issue, we performed a nationwide registry-based cohort study to investigate the association between recent statin exposure and the risk of severe COVID-19 infection and all-cause mortality in patients with COVID-19 infection.\nMethods\nData sources\nIn Denmark, all citizens are assigned a unique and personal identification number, which allows accurate linkage of nationwide administrative registries at an individual level. For this study, data from the following nationwide administrative registries were obtained: the Danish National Patient Registry, which contains data on all hospital admissions and outpatient contacts according to the International Classification of Diseases (ICD); the Danish National Prescription Registry, which holds information on dispensing date, strength and quantity of all claimed drug prescriptions in Denmark; the Danish Civil Registration System, which holds information on birth date, sex and vital status (ie, whether a person is alive and a resident of Denmark, disappeared, emigrated or dead, along with the date of these events); and Statistics Denmark, which holds data on education, household income and marital status. The Danish registries are validated, of high quality and have been described in detail previously.\nStudy population\nThe study population comprised all Danish citizens who were examined at a hospital, including inpatient, outpatient and emergency department visits, and had a primary or secondary diagnosis code for COVID-19 infection (ICD-10 codes: B342, B972) from 22 February 2020 until 17 May 2020. According to the Danish Ministry of Health, these codes have a positive predictive value of 99%. Comorbidity was obtained using in-hospital and outpatient diagnosis codes any time prior to diagnosis (online supplemental etable 1 for ICD-8 and ICD-10 codes). Patients with hypertension were identified using claimed drug prescriptions as described previously. Pharmacotherapy at baseline was defined as claimed prescriptions within 180 days prior to diagnosis (online supplemental eTable 2 for Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) Classification System codes). The highest level of completed education was classified in accordance with the International Standard Classification of Education. Average household income in 2018 was calculated and graded in quartiles. The duration of statin treatment prior to COVID-19 diagnosis was determined for each individual during follow-up using an algorithm based on claimed prescriptions, taking date of claimed prescriptions, dosage and packing size into account, as described previously.\nExposure\nExposure to statins was defined as at least one redeemed prescription of a statin (ATC code C10AA) in the 6 months prior to diagnosis.\nOutcomes\nThe primary outcome was all-cause mortality. The secondary outcomes were (1) severe COVID-19 infection, defined as a hospital diagnosis of 'COVID-19 severe acute respiratory syndrome' (ICD-10 code: B972A) or admission to an intensive care unit; and (2) the composite of all-cause mortality or severe COVID-19 infection. Patients were followed from the date of diagnosis until occurrence of the outcome of interest, death, emigration or 17 May 2020, whichever came first.\nStatistics\nBaseline characteristics were reported as frequencies with percentages or medians with 25th-75th percentiles. Differences in baseline characteristics according to statin exposure were tested with chi2 test for categorical variables and Mann-Whitney test for continuous variables. Cause-specific unadjusted and adjusted Cox regression models were used to compare outcomes according to statin exposure. Adjusted models included the following variables: age (modelled as a restricted cubic spline with three knots: 10th, 50th and 90th percentile), sex, ethnicity (native Danish, immigrant, descendant from immigrant), education, income, comorbidity (ie, history of ischaemic heart disease, stroke, peripheral artery disease, diabetes mellitus, heart failure, atrial fibrillation, hypertension, malignancy, chronic kidney disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, liver disease) and concomitant medical treatment (ie, aspirin, oral anticoagulants, beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors). Reported were HRs, 30-day risks of outcomes standardised to the risk factor distribution of all patients in the sample, and differences of standardised 30-day risks. For the outcome severe COVID-19 infection, the main Cox regression model was combined with a Cox regression model for the rate of the competing risk of death without severe COVID-19 infection. Interactions between statin exposure and clinically relevant variables (including age categories, sex, presumed indication for statin therapy (ie, history of stroke, ischaemic heart disease, peripheral artery disease, diabetes mellitus or familial hypercholesterolaemia)) on outcomes were tested for. All statistical analyses were performed with SAS V.9.4 statistical software and R V.3.6.1 (The R Foundation). The level of statistical significance was set at 5%.\nTo test the robustness of our findings, a number of sensitivity analyses were performed: (1) The definition of statin exposure was changed from at least one redeemed prescription of a statin in the 6 months prior to diagnosis to 3 months. (2) The risk of death among patients with severe COVID-19 infection according to statin exposure was examined. (3) Among patients with statin exposure, the risks of outcomes according to statin treatment intensity (ie, high-intensity vs moderate-intensity/low-intensity) were investigated. High-intensity statin therapy was defined as either (1) atorvastatin 40-80 mg daily, (2) rosuvastatin 20-40 mg daily or (3) simvastatin 80 mg daily. (4) Among patients with statin exposure, the risk of outcomes according to statin drug (ie, simvastatin, atorvastatin, rosuvastatin) was examined. Pravastatin was excluded from this analysis due to a low number of patients prescribed this drug. (5) The statin population was restricted to those with a treatment duration of at least 3 months.\nPatient and public involvement\nThis research was done without patient involvement. Patients were not invited to comment on the study design and were not consulted to develop patient relevant outcomes or interpret the results. Patients were not invited to contribute to the writing or editing of this document for readability or accuracy.\nResults\nIn total, 4842 patients with COVID-19 infection were included in the study. Of these, 843 (17.4%) redeemed a prescription of statins within 6 months prior to diagnosis. The first patient was included on 22 February 2020 and the last patient on 17 May 2020. The median age of the study population was 54 years (25th-75th percentile, 40-72), and 47.1% were men. The mean duration of statin treatment prior to COVID-19 diagnosis was 3.6 years. The baseline characteristics of the patients in the groups of interest are summarised in table 1. Patients with statin exposure were older, more often men and native Danish, had a greater prevalence of cardiovascular and non-cardiovascular comorbidities, and a higher utilisation of medication compared with those admitted with no statin exposure. The median follow-up time from the date of COVID-19 diagnosis was 44 days (25th-75th percentile, 29-56).\nBaseline characteristics of patients with COVID-19 with and without statin exposure\n	No statin exposuren=3999	Statin exposuren=843	 	Demographics	 		 	 Age, median (25th-75th percentile)	50 (37-65)	73 (63-79)	 	 Age, n (%)	 		 	 &lt;50 years	1965 (49.1)	40 (4.7)	 	 50-70 years	1246 (31.2)	307 (36.4)	 	 &gt;71 years	788 (19.7)	496 (58.8)	 	 Male, n (%)	1766 (44.2)	515 (61.1)	 	 Ethnicity, n (%)	 		 	 Native Danish	3270 (81.8)	729 (86.5)	 	 Immigrant	610 (15.2)	110 (13.0)	 	 Descendant from immigrant	119 (3.0)	4 (0.5)	 	Socioeconomic status	 		 	 Education, n (%)	 		 	 Basic school	980 (24.5)	294 (34.9)	 	 High school/vocational education	1427 (35.7)	369 (43.8)	 	 Short/medium higher education	506 (12.6)	53 (6.3)	 	 Long higher education	1086 (27.2)	127 (15.1)	 	 Income group, n (%)	 		 	 Q1 (lowest)	987 (24.7)	223 (26.4)	 	 Q2	922 (23.0)	289 (34.3)	 	 Q3	1003 (25.1)	208 (24.7)	 	 Q4 (highest)	1087 (27.2)	123 (14.6)	 	Comorbidities, n (%)	 		 	 Ischaemic heart disease	182 (4.6)	262 (31.1)	 	 Stroke	95 (2.4)	119 (14.1)	 	 Peripheral artery disease	35 (0.9)	51 (6.0)	 	 Diabetes	188 (4.7)	230 (27.3)	 	 Heart failure	98 (2.5)	85 (10.1)	 	 Atrial fibrillation	206 (5.2)	144 (17.1)	 	 Hypertension	491 (12.3)	452 (53.6)	 	 Malignancy	345 (8.6)	147 (17.4)	 	 Chronic kidney disease	127 (3.2)	104 (12.3)	 	 Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease	142 (3.6)	80 (9.5)	 	 Liver disease	95 (2.4)	18 (2.1)	 	Concomitant medical treatment, n (%)	 		 	 Aspirin	132 (3.3)	238 (28.2)	 	 Oral anticoagulants	222 (5.6)	169 (20.0)	 	 Beta-blockers	283 (7.1)	303 (35.9)	 	 Calcium channel blockers	282 (7.1)	247 (29.3)	 	 RAAS inhibitors	522 (13.1)	438 (52.0)	 	Type of statin, n (%)	 		 	 Atorvastatin	N/A	426 (50.5)	 	 Simvastatin	N/A	351 (41.7)	 	 Rosuvastatin	N/A	57 (6.8)	 	 Pravastatin	N/A	9 (1.0)	 	\nN/A, not applicable; RAAS, renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors.\nAll-cause mortality, composite outcome and severe COVID-19 infection\nUnadjusted, sex-adjusted and age-adjusted, and fully adjusted HRs for statin exposure and outcomes are shown in figure 1. Table 2 displays unadjusted, sex-adjusted and age-adjusted, and fully adjusted standardised 30-day absolute risks of outcomes according to statin exposure. In total, 488 (10.1%) patients died during follow-up: 177 (21.0%) in the statin group and 311 (7.8%) in the non-statin group. In the unadjusted Cox regression analysis, statin exposure was associated with a significantly higher risk of mortality compared with no statin exposure (HR 2.87 (95% CI 2.39 to 3.46)). However, when adjusting for age, sex, ethnicity, socioeconomic status and comorbidities, statin exposure was not associated with a significantly different risk of mortality (HR 0.96 (95% CI 0.78 to 1.18)). Similarly, the standardised absolute 30-day risk of all-cause mortality was not significantly different between groups (9.8% (8.7% to 11.0%) vs 9.5% (8.2% to 10.8%) in the no statin and statin exposure groups, respectively; standardised absolute risk difference, -0.4% (-1.9% to 1.2%)).\nHR for all-cause mortality, a composite of severe COVID-19 infection or all-cause mortality, and severe COVID-19 infection according to statin exposure.

Although statin exposure was associated with a significantly higher risk of the composite outcome compared with no statin exposure in the unadjusted Cox regression analysis (HR 2.57 (95% CI 2.34 to 2.96)), statin exposure was not associated with a significantly different risk of mortality in the fully adjusted analysis (HR 1.05 (95% CI 0.89 to 1.23)). Similarly, the standardised absolute 30-day risk of the composite outcome was not significantly different between groups (17.6% (16.4% to 18.8%) vs 18.2% (16.4% to 20.1%) in the no statin and statin exposure groups, respectively; standardised absolute risk difference, 0.6% (-1.6% to 2.9%)).\nIn total, 623 (12.9%) patients developed severe COVID-19 infection during follow-up: 204 (24.2%) in the statin group and 419 (10.5%) in the non-statin group. In the unadjusted Cox regression analysis, statin exposure was associated with a significantly higher risk of severe COVID-19 infection compared with no statin exposure (HR 2.41 (95% CI 2.04 to 2.85)). However, in the fully adjusted analysis, statin exposure was not associated with a significantly different risk of severe COVID-19 infection (HR 1.16 (95% CI 0.95 to 1.41)). Similarly, the standardised absolute 30-day risk of severe COVID-19 infection was not significantly different between groups (13.0% (11.8% to 14.2%) vs 14.9% (12.8% to 17.1%) in the no statin and statin exposure groups, respectively; standardised absolute risk difference, 1.9% (-0.7% to 4.5%)).\nSubgroup and sensitivity analyses\nThe results of the prespecified subgroup analyses for the primary and secondary outcomes are displayed in table 3.

(1) The definition of statin exposure was changed from as at least one redeemed prescription of a statin in the 6 months prior to diagnosis to 3 months. In total, 646 (13.3%) patients redeemed a prescription of a statin within 3 months. Among those who redeemed a statin prescription within 6 months, but not within 3 months, 82.2% redeemed a prescription of 100 tablets or more. In this analysis, statin exposure was not associated with a significantly different risk of all-cause mortality (adjusted HR 0.97 (95% CI 0.78 to 120); standardised absolute 30-day risk difference, -0.2% (-1.8% to 1.3%)), a composite of all-cause mortality or severe COVID-19 infection (adjusted HR 1.06 (95% CI 0.90 to 1.26); standardised absolute 30-day risk difference, 0.9% (-1.4% to 3.3%)), or severe COVID-19 infection (adjusted HR 1.18 (95% CI 0.97 to 1.45); standardised absolute 30-day risk difference, 2.3% (-0.4% to 5.1%)). (2) The risk of death among patients with severe COVID-19 infection according to statin exposure was examined. In this analysis, statin exposure was not associated with a significantly different risk of all-cause mortality (adjusted HR 0.91 (95% CI 0.65 to 1.27)). (3) Among patients with statin exposure, the risks of outcomes according to intensity of statin therapy were investigated. In total, 305 (36.2%) patients received high-intensity statin therapy. Compared with moderate-intensity/low-intensity therapy, high-intensity statin therapy was not associated with a significantly different risk of all-cause mortality (adjusted HR 1.07 (95% CI 0.77 to 1.50)), a composite of all-cause mortality or severe COVID-19 infection (adjusted HR 0.95 (95% CI 0.73 to 1.22)), or severe COVID-19 infection (adjusted HR 0.81 (95% CI 0.60 to 1.10)). (4) Among patients with statin exposure, the risks of outcomes according to statin drug were investigated. Compared with simvastatin, atorvastatin and rosuvastatin were not associated with a significantly different risk of all-cause mortality (atorvastatin: adjusted HR 0.99 (95% CI 0.72 to 1.37); rosuvastatin: adjusted HR 0.43 (95% CI 0.15 to 1.19)), a composite of all-cause mortality or severe COVID-19 infection (atorvastatin: adjusted HR 0.91 (95% CI 0.71 to 1.17); rosuvastatin: adjusted HR 0.90 (95% CI 0.53 to 1.54)), or severe COVID-19 infection (atorvastatin: adjusted HR 0.80 (95% CI 0.60 to 1.08); rosuvastatin: adjusted HR 1.03 (95% CI 0.59 to 1.82)). (5) The statin population was restricted to those with a treatment duration of at least 3 months. Excluding patients in the statin group with a treatment duration less than 3 months, the population yielded similar findings as the main results (all-cause mortality, adjusted HR 1.00 (95% CI 0.81 to 1.24); a composite of all-cause mortality or severe infection, 1.09 (0.92 to 1.29); severe COVID-19 infection, 1.19 (0.97 to 1.47)).\nDiscussion\nIn this Danish nationwide cohort study, we investigated the association between recent statin exposure and the risk of all-cause mortality or severe infection, individually and as a composite, in patients with COVID-19 infection. The main finding of this study was that statin exposure prior to COVID-19 diagnosis was not associated with an improvement or deterioration in the clinical course of patients with COVID-19 infection, and this was consistent across clinically relevant subgroups.\nIn a recent observational study using data from 21 hospitals in Hubei Province, China, Zhang et al  demonstrated that in-hospital use of statins was associated with improved survival among patients hospitalised with COVID-19. Specifically, the authors found a 28-day mortality risk of 5.2% and 9.4% in the statin and non-statin user groups, respectively, and that in-hospital use of statins was associated with a 42% decrease in in-hospital mortality. Although the data may be biased by patient selection, treatment indication and residual confounding, including lack of adjustment for socioeconomic status and prehospital medication, this controversial finding merits further investigation. In addition, Farag et al performed a computer-based study and used a structure-based drug design to screen more than 2000 Food and Drug Administration-approved drugs against SARS-CoV-2 main protease enzyme substrate-binding pocket. Other than antiviral drugs, the authors also identified rosuvastatin as a drug that may be useful against SARS-CoV-2. On the other hand, other observational studies, including a meta-analysis, did not find an association between statin therapy and improved outcomes in patients with COVID-19. In our nationwide cohort study including all patients with COVID-19, irrespective of hospitalisation status, we did not find any association between statin use prior to diagnosis and the risk of all-cause mortality or severe COVID-19 infection, individually and as a composite. These results were consistent across clinically relevant subgroups, including age, sex and presumed indication for statin therapy. In addition, among patients using statins, type of statin drug did not significantly modify the risk of outcomes, although there was a trend towards a lower risk of all-cause mortality with rosuvastatin. Further studies are warranted to establish whether rosuvastatin may improve outcomes in patients with COVID-19 infection. Taken together, our study does not provide evidence of a beneficial effect of statin exposure prior to COVID-19 diagnosis.\nSeveral hypotheses have been proposed in relation to the role of statin therapy in patients with COVID-19. It has been proposed that statins may improve the clinical course in patients with COVID-19, and several mechanisms by which statins exert their potential beneficial effects have been proposed. For example, reports of cardiac involvement during the course of the infection, particularly in severe cases, have emerged, and it has been hypothesised that statins, at least to some extent, may prevent or decrease the likelihood of myocardial injury and cardiovascular events. Further, statins may modulate the immune response, improve endothelial function, and decrease oxidative stress and inflammation and thereby predispose to less severe infection and better outcomes. Data on such effects of statins in humans, however, are conflicting. While some randomised trials and observational studies have demonstrated possible benefits of statins in reducing mortality and improving the clinical course of patients with severe infections, particularly viral infections, others have not found any beneficial effects of statins in this setting. On the other hand, preclinical studies have suggested that statins upregulate the expression of ACE2, an enzyme thought to facilitate entry of SARS-CoV-2 into the cells, although this hypothesis has not been proven in humans. Moreover, hypercholesterolaemia has been reported to be one of the most common comorbidities in patients with COVID-19, although the majority of these case series did not report data on medication, including statins. These considerations had led to the hypothesis that statins confer a greater risk of more severe infection and adverse outcomes during COVID-19 infection. In light of these concerns, it is reassuring that statins were not associated with a deterioration in the clinical course of these patients in our study. Taken together, our findings do not support discontinuation of statin therapy in patients with an indication for statins. However, it is important to emphasise the inherent limitations of observational studies, including residual confounding, confounding by indication and inadequate assessment of causal inference. There is, therefore, a need for further studies to establish the role of statins in patients with COVID-19 with and without an indication for statin therapy. Several randomised clinical trials have been initiated to assess this clinically relevant issue, and the results from these trials are anticipated.\nAnother potential concern with statins during COVID-19 infection is liver injury. Reports of liver injury during the course of the infection, particularly in severe cases, have emerged. Although statins are generally considered to be safe and well tolerated, in rare cases, these medications may also induce liver injury. Consequently, the European Society of Cardiology guidelines for the diagnosis and management of cardiovascular disease during the COVID-19 pandemic recommend withholding statin therapy temporarily in patients with COVID-19 with increased liver enzymes. Whether statin therapy confers an increased risk of liver injury and subsequent adverse outcomes during COVID-19 infection has not been established. Our study did not allow for a direct assessment of this issue due to lack of data on in-hospital medication and laboratory findings. Nevertheless, it is reassuring that statin exposure prior to diagnosis was not associated with an increased risk of worse outcomes in patients with COVID-19. Further studies, preferably randomised controlled trials, are needed to clarify the association between statin therapy and liver injury on subsequent outcomes during COVID-19 infection.\nStrengths and limitations\nThe main strength of this study is the completeness of data from nationwide administrative registries. The Danish healthcare system, funded by taxes, provides equal access to healthcare services for all residents regardless of socioeconomic or insurance status. In Denmark, statins can be purchased only through prescription. Due to partial reimbursement of drug expenses by the Danish healthcare system, pharmacies are required to register all redeemed prescriptions ensuring complete and accurate registration. The findings of this study should be viewed in the context of a number of limitations. The observational nature of this study precludes the assessment of cause-effect relationships; thus, only associations are reported. Residual confounding cannot be excluded despite adjustment for potential confounders, and it is likely that these adjustments were not sufficient to even out the differences between the groups. For example, mounting evidence suggests that patients with COVID-19 may develop clinically significant coagulopathy with fatal thromboembolic complications, and more statin users were treated with aspirin and oral anticoagulants compared with non-statin users. Although we attempted to minimise the impact of these differences by adjusting for concomitant medication, including aspirin and oral anticoagulants, in the fully adjusted analyses, we cannot exclude the possibility that these differences may have had an impact on the association between statin use and outcomes. In addition, confounding by indication cannot be omitted in pharmacoepidemiological studies despite our attempt to minimise the impact of this limitation by performing several subgroup analyses (eg, patients with or without a presumed indication for statin therapy). We did not have laboratory data to confirm a positive swab test for COVID-19. However, coding of both tested individuals with tentative diagnosis codes and those with positive swabs with definite diagnosis codes have been and are systematically performed in Denmark, and the Danish Ministry of Health have indicated a positive predictive value of 99% of these codes. Compared with the official COVID-19 case numbers in Denmark, this study included fewer cases because ICD-10 codes capture only those patients who were diagnosed in the hospital system (inpatient, outpatient or emergency department visits) and not in dedicated COVID-19 diagnostic kiosks. It is therefore possible that some patients with no or few symptoms may not have been captured by our ICD-10 codes. The outcomes examined in this study were clinically relevant 'hard' endpoints. Although it would have been interesting to examine the association between recent statin exposure and symptom improvement in patients with COVID-19, data on symptoms were not available. In addition, due to lack of data on in-hospital medication, we were not able to investigate the impact of in-hospital statin therapy on outcomes. Likewise, data on statin treatment (dis)continuation after the COVID-19 diagnosis were not available, although it was encouraged to continue statin treatment at the Danish hospitals. Exposure to statins was defined by redeemed prescriptions in the 6 months prior to diagnosis, although similar results were yielded when restricting this definition from 6 months to 3 months. It is possible that some patients may discontinue statin treatment prior to diagnosis due to early symptoms of COVID-19 infection. However, we believe that this number is likely to be low, as the mainstream media and professional medical societies have not raised questions about statin treatment in the setting of COVID-19 to the same extent as, for example, ACE inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blocker treatment. Finally, data on whether patients were prescribed statins for primary or secondary prevention were not available. However, restricting the study population to patients with a presumed indication for statin therapy (ie, history of stroke, ischaemic heart disease, peripheral artery disease, diabetes mellitus or familial hypercholesterolaemia) yielded similar findings as the main analyses.\nConclusions\nIn this Danish nationwide cohort study, recent statin exposure in patients with COVID-19 infection was not associated with an increased or decreased risk of all-cause mortality or severe infection. Hence, our study does not suggest benefit or harm of statin therapy in patients with COVID-19. However, further studies are needed to establish the role of statins in patients with COVID-19 with and without an indication for statin therapy. Several randomised clinical trials have been initiated to assess this clinically relevant issue in patients with COVID-19, and the results from these trials are anticipated.\nSupplementary Material\nContributors: JHB and ELF had full access to all of the data in the study and take responsibility for the integrity of the data and the accuracy of the data analysis.

reductase inhibitors (“statins”) have been hypothesized to affect COVID-19 severity.\n\n However, up to now, no studies investigating this association have been conducted in the most vulnerable and affected population groups (ie, older adults residing in nursing homes).\n\n The objective of this study was to explore the association of ACEi/ARB and/or statins with clinical manifestations in COVID-19–infected older adults residing in nursing homes.\n\n\nDesign\nWe undertook a retrospective multicenter cohort study to analyze the association between ACEi/ARB and/or statin use with clinical outcome of COVID-19. The outcomes were (1) serious COVID-19 defined as long-stay hospital admission or death within 14 days of disease onset, and (2) asymptomatic (ie, no disease symptoms in the whole study period while still being diagnosed by polymerase chain reaction).\n\n\nSetting and participants\nA total of 154 COVID-19–positive subjects were identified, residing in 1 of 2 Belgian nursing homes that experienced similar COVID-19 outbreaks.\n\n\nMeasures\nLogistic regression models were applied with age, sex, functional status, diabetes, and hypertension as covariates.\n\n\nResults\nWe found a statistically significant association between statin intake and the absence of symptoms during COVID-19 (odds ratio [OR] 2.91; confidence interval [CI] 1.27–6.71), which remained statistically significant after adjusting for covariates (OR 2.65; CI 1.13–6.68).\n\n Although the effects of statin intake on serious clinical outcome were in the same beneficial direction, these were not statistically significant

of liver injury indicators and their potential risk factors may provide an important explanation for the COVID?19?associated liver injury.\n\n Because elevated liver injury indicators, particularly AST, are strongly associated with the mortality risk, our study indicates that these parameters should be monitored during hospitalization.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7267515","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"John Wiley and Sons

Residents","abstract":"Objectives\nAngiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi), angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs), and HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (“statins”) have been hypothesized to affect COVID-19 severity.\n\n However, up to now, no studies investigating this association have been conducted in the most vulnerable and affected population groups (ie, older adults residing in nursing homes).\n\n The objective of this study was to explore the association of ACEi/ARB and/or statins with clinical manifestations in COVID-19–infected older adults residing in nursing homes.\n\n\nDesign\nWe undertook a retrospective multicenter cohort study to analyze the association between ACEi/ARB and/or statin use with clinical outcome of COVID-19. The outcomes were (1) serious COVID-19 defined as long-stay hospital admission or death within 14 days of disease onset, and (2) asymptomatic (ie, no disease symptoms in the whole study period while still being diagnosed by polymerase chain reaction).\n\n\nSetting and participants\nA total of 154 COVID-19–positive subjects were identified, residing in 1 of 2 Belgian nursing homes that experienced similar COVID-19 outbreaks.\n\n\nMeasures\nLogistic regression models were applied with age, sex, functional status, diabetes, and hypertension as covariates.\n\n\nResults\nWe found a statistically significant association between statin intake and the absence of symptoms during COVID-19 (odds ratio [OR] 2.91; confidence interval [CI] 1.27–6.71), which remained statistically significant after adjusting for covariates (OR 2.65; CI 1.13–6.68).\n\n Although the effects of statin intake on serious clinical outcome were in the same beneficial direction, these were not statistically significant (OR 0.75; CI 0.24–1.87).\n\n There was also no statistically significant association between ACEi/ARB and asymptomatic status (OR 2.72; CI 0.59–25.1) or serious clinical outcome (OR 0.48; CI 0.10–1.97).\n\n\nConclusions and Implications\nOur data indicate that statin intake in older, frail adults could be associated with a considerable beneficial effect on COVID-19 clinical symptoms.\n\n The role of statins and renin-angiotensin system drugs needs to be further explored in larger observational studies as well as randomized clinical trials.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7294267","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"AMDA - The Society for Post-Acute and Long-Term Care Medicine.","authors":[{"firstname":"Anton","surname":"De

Of six family members who travelled to Wuhan, five were identified as infected with the novel coronavirus.\n\n Additionally, one family member, who did not travel to Wuhan, became infected with the virus after several days of contact with four of the family members.\n\n None of the family members had contacts with Wuhan markets or animals, although two had visited a Wuhan hospital.\n\n Five family members (aged 36–66 years) presented with fever, upper or lower respiratory tract symptoms, or diarrhoea, or a combination of these 3–6 days after exposure.\n\n They presented to our hospital (The University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen) 6–10 days after symptom onset.\n\n They and one asymptomatic child (aged 10 years) had radiological ground-glass lung opacities.\n\n Older patients (aged &gt;60 years) had more systemic symptoms, extensive radiological ground-glass lung changes, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and increased C-reactive protein and lactate dehydrogenase levels.\n\n The nasopharyngeal or throat swabs of these six patients were negative for known respiratory microbes by point-of-care multiplex RT-PCR, but five patients (four adults and the child) were RT-PCR positive for genes encoding the internal RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and surface Spike protein of this novel coronavirus, which were confirmed by Sanger sequencing.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these five patients' RT-PCR amplicons and two full genomes by next-generation sequencing showed that this is a novel coronavirus, which is closest to the bat severe acute respiatory syndrome

NLR and categorized patients by quartile of this ratio.\n\n The association of NLR quartiles and 28-day mortality was assessed using multivariable logistic regression.\n\n Secondary outcomes included

coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) started in December, 2019, in Wuhan, China.\n\n Information about critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection is scarce.\n\n We aimed to describe the clinical course and outcomes of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this single-centered, retrospective, observational study, we enrolled 52 critically ill adult patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia who were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) of Wuhan Jin Yin-tan hospital (Wuhan, China) between late December, 2019, and Jan 26, 2020. Demographic data, symptoms, laboratory values, comorbidities, treatments, and clinical outcomes were all collected.\n\n Data were compared between survivors and non-survivors.\n\n The primary outcome was 28-day mortality, as of Feb 9, 2020. Secondary outcomes included incidence of SARS-CoV-2-related acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and the proportion of patients requiring mechanical ventilation.\n\n\nFindings\nOf 710 patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, 52 critically ill adult patients were included.\n\n The mean age of the 52 patients was 59·7 (SD 13·3) years, 35 (67%) were men, 21 (40%) had chronic illness, 51 (98%) had fever.\n\n 32 (61·5%) patients had died at 28 days, and the median duration from admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) to death was 7 (IQR 3–11) days for non-survivors.\n\n Compared with survivors, non-survivors were older (64·6 years [11·2] vs 51·9 years [12·9]), more likely to develop ARDS (26 [81%] patients vs 9 [45%] patients), and more likely to receive mechanical ventilation (30 [94%] patients vs 7 [35%] patients), either invasively or non-invasively.\n\n Most patients had organ function damage, including 35 (67%) with ARDS, 15 (29%) with acute kidney injury, 12 (23%) with cardiac injury, 15 (29%) with liver dysfunction, and one (2%) with pneumothorax.\n\n 37 (71%) patients required mechanical ventilation.\n\n Hospital-acquired infection occurred in seven (13·5%) patients.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe mortality of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia is considerable.\n\n The survival time of the non-survivors is likely to be within 1–2 weeks after ICU admission.\n\n Older patients (&gt;65 years) with comorbidities and ARDS are at increased risk of death.\n\n The severity of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia poses great strain on critical care resources in hospitals, especially if they are not adequately staffed or resourced.\n\n\nFunding\nNone.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7102538","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Elsevier

Characteristics of Coronavirus Disease 2019 in China","abstract":"Background\nSince December 2019, when coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) emerged in Wuhan city and rapidly spread throughout China, data have been needed on the clinical characteristics of the affected patients.\n\n\nMethods\nWe extracted data regarding 1099 patients with laboratory-confirmed Covid-19 from 552 hospitals in 30 provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities in mainland China through January 29, 2020. The primary composite end point was admission to an intensive care unit (ICU), the use of mechanical ventilation, or death.\n\n\nResults\nThe median age of the patients was 47 years; 41.9% of the patients were female.\n\n The primary composite end point occurred in 67 patients (6.1%), including 5.0% who were admitted to the ICU, 2.3% who underwent invasive mechanical ventilation, and 1.4% who died.\n\n Only 1.9% of the patients had a history of direct contact with wildlife.\n\n Among nonresidents of Wuhan, 72.3% had contact with residents of Wuhan, including 31.3% who had visited the city.\n\n The most common symptoms were fever (43.8% on admission and 88.7% during hospitalization) and cough (67.8%).\n\n Diarrhea was uncommon (3.8%).\n\n The median incubation period was 4 days (interquartile range, 2 to 7).\n\n On admission, ground-glass opacity was the most common radiologic finding on chest computed tomography (CT) (56.4%).\n\n No radiographic or CT abnormality was found in 157 of 877 patients (17.9%) with nonsevere disease and in 5 of 173 patients (2.9%) with severe disease.\n\n Lymphocytopenia was present in 83.2% of the patients on admission.\n\n\nConclusions\nDuring the first 2 months of the current outbreak, Covid-19 spread rapidly throughout China and caused varying degrees of illness.\n\n Patients often presented without fever, and many did not have abnormal radiologic findings.\n\n (Funded by the National Health Commission of China and others.\n\n)\n","id":"PMC7092819","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Massachusetts Medical

is surrounded by a lipid bilayer.\n Lipids are fundamental cell components that play various biological roles ranging from being a structural building block to a signaling molecule as well as a central energy store.\n The role lipids play in viral infection involves the fusion of the viral membrane to the host cell, viral replication, and viral endocytosis and exocytosis.\n Since lipids play a crucial function in the viral life cycle, we asked whether drugs targeting lipid metabolism, such as statins, can be utilized against SARS-CoV-2 and other viruses.\n In this review, we discuss the role of lipid metabolism in viral infection as well as the possibility of targeting lipid metabolism to interfere with the viral life

respiratory distress syndrome, respiratory failure, sepsis, and acute kidney injury, COVID-19 also causes heart failure (HF).\n COVID-19-induced HF is manifested via different mechanisms, including, but not limited to, (1) virus-induced infiltration of inflammatory cells, which could impair the function of the heart; (2) pro-inflammatory cytokines (monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, interleukin-1?; interleukin-6; tumor necrosis factor-?) that could cause necrosis and death of the myocardium; (3) endothelial injury coupled with micro-thrombosis which could damage the endocardium; and (4) acute respiratory distress syndrome and respiratory failure that could lead to heart failure due to severe hypoxia.\n It is concluded that the etiology of COVID-19-induced HF is multifactorial

might be at increased risk of COVID-19 reinfection and development of long COVID.\n Differences between sexes have been observed in other infectious diseases and in the response to vaccines.\n Sex-specific expression patterns of proteins mediating virus binding and entry, and divergent reactions of the immune and endocrine system, in particular the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis, in response to acute stress might explain the higher severity of COVID-19 in men.\n In this Personal View, we discuss how sex hormones, comorbidities, and the sex chromosome complement influence these mechanisms in the context of COVID-19. Due to its role in the severity and progression of SARS-CoV-2 infections, we argue that sexual dimorphism has potential implications for disease treatment, public health measures, and follow-up of

cardiovascular comorbidities","abstract":"The high mortality rate of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection is a critical concern of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic.\n Strikingly, men account for the majority of COVID-19 deaths, with current figures ranging from 59% to 75% of total mortality.\n However, despite clear implications in relation to COVID-19 mortality, most research has not considered sex as a critical factor in data analysis.\n Here, we highlight fundamental biological differences that exist between males and females, and how these may make significant contributions to the male-biased COVID-19 mortality.\n We present preclinical evidence identifying the influence of biological sex on the expression and regulation of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is the main receptor used by SARS-CoV-2 to enter cells.\n However, we note that there is a lack of reports showing that sexual dimorphism of ACE2 expression exists and is of functional relevance in humans.\n In contrast, there is strong evidence, especially in the context of viral infections, that sexual dimorphism plays a central role in the genetic and hormonal regulation of immune responses, both of the innate and the adaptive immune system.\n We review evidence supporting that ineffective anti-SARS-CoV-2 responses, coupled with a predisposition for inappropriate hyperinflammatory responses, could provide a biological explanation for the male bias in COVID-19 mortality.\n A prominent finding in COVID-19 is the increased risk of death with pre-existing cardiovascular comorbidities, such as hypertension, obesity, and age.\n We contextualize how important features of sexual dimorphism and inflammation in COVID-19 may exhibit a reciprocal relationship with comorbidities, and explain their increased mortality risk.\n Ultimately, we demonstrate that biological sex is a fundamental variable of critical relevance to our mechanistic understanding of SARS-CoV-2 infection and the pursuit of effective COVID-19 preventative and therapeutic strategies.\n","id":"PMC7665363","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Oxford University Press","authors":[{"firstname":"Laura

decided to perform a new meta-analysis of the observational studies that explored the relationship between pre-existing hypertension and mortality risk in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection, using more stringent inclusion criteria to overcome the limitations inherent previous meta-analyses.\n\n\nMethods\nA systematic search of the on-line databases available up to 31 March 2022 was conducted, including peer-reviewed original articles, involving the adult population, where the role of hypertension on mortality due to SARS-CoV-2 infection was determined by Cox-proportional hazard models.\n\n

COVID-19—Mechanisms and Therapeutic Targets","abstract":"The outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic represents an ongoing healthcare emergency responsible for more than 3.4 million deaths worldwide.\n COVID-19 is the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2, a virus that targets not only the lungs but also the cardiovascular system.\n COVID-19 can manifest with a wide range of clinical manifestations, from mild symptoms to severe forms of the disease, characterized by respiratory failure due to severe alveolar damage.\n Several studies investigated the underlying mechanisms of the severe lung damage associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection and revealed that the respiratory failure associated with COVID-19 is the consequence not only of acute respiratory distress syndrome but also of macro- and microvascular involvement.\n New observations show that COVID-19 is an endothelial disease, and the consequent endotheliopathy is responsible for inflammation, cytokine storm, oxidative stress, and coagulopathy.\n In this review, we show the central role of endothelial dysfunction, inflammation, and oxidative stress in the COVID-19 pathogenesis and present the therapeutic targets deriving from this endotheliopathy.\n","id":"PMC8397545","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Hindawi","authors":[{"firstname":"Adriana","surname":"Fodor","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Brandusa","surname":"Tiperciuc","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Brandusa","surname":"Tiperciuc","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Cezar","surname":"Login","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Cezar","surname":"Login","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Olga

(ACE2) is a type I integral membrane that exists in two forms: the first is a transmembrane protein; the second is a soluble catalytic ectodomain of ACE2. The catalytic ectodomain of ACE2 undergoes shedding by a disintegrin and metalloproteinase domain-containing protein 17 (ADAM17), in which calmodulin mediates the calcium signaling pathway that is involved in ACE2 release, resulting in a soluble catalytic ectodomain of ACE2 that can be measured as soluble ACE2 plasma activity.\n The shedding of the ACE2 catalytic ectodomain plays a role in cardiac remodeling and endothelial dysfunction and is a predictor of all-cause mortality, including cardiovascular mortality.\n Moreover, considerable evidence supports that the ACE2 catalytic ectodomain is an essential entry receptor for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection.\n Additionally, endotoxins and the pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)-1? and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF?) all enhanced soluble catalytic ectodomain ACE2 shedding from the airway epithelia, suggesting that the shedding of ACE2 may represent a mechanism by which viral entry and infection may be controlled such as some types of betacoronavirus.\n In this regard, ACE2 plays an important role in inflammation and thrombotic response, and its down-regulation may aggravate COVID-19 via the renin-angiotensin system, including by promoting pathological changes in lung injury.\n Soluble forms of ACE2 have recently been shown to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infection.\n Furthermore, given that vitamin D enhanced the shedding of ACE2, some studies reported that vitamin D treatment is associated with prognosis improvement in COVID-19.

trivalent function: a negative regulator of the renin-angiotensin system, facilitator of amino acid transport, and the severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and SARS-CoV-2 receptor.\n ACE2 is widely expressed, including, in the lungs, cardiovascular system, gut, kidneys, central nervous system, and adipose tissue.\n ACE2 has recently been identified as the SARS-CoV-2 receptor, the infective agent responsible for coronavirus disease 2019, providing a critical link between immunity, inflammation, ACE2, and cardiovascular disease.\n Although sharing a close evolutionary relationship with SARS-CoV, the receptor-binding domain of SARS-CoV-2 differs in several key amino acid residues, allowing for stronger binding affinity with the human ACE2 receptor, which may account for the greater pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2. The loss of ACE2 function following binding by SARS-CoV-2 is driven by endocytosis and activation of proteolytic cleavage and processing.\n The ACE2 system is a critical protective pathway against heart failure with reduced and preserved ejection fraction including, myocardial infarction and hypertension, and against lung disease and diabetes mellitus.\n The control of gut dysbiosis and vascular permeability by ACE2 has emerged as an essential mechanism of pulmonary hypertension and diabetic cardiovascular complications.\n Recombinant ACE2, gene-delivery of Ace2, Ang 1–7 analogs, and Mas receptor agonists enhance ACE2 action and serve as potential therapies for disease conditions associated with an activated renin-angiotensin system.\n rhACE2 (recombinant human ACE2) has completed clinical trials and efficiently lowered or increased plasma angiotensin II and angiotensin 1-7 levels, respectively.\n Our review summarizes the progress over the past 20 years, highlighting the critical role of ACE2 as the novel SARS-CoV-2 receptor and as the negative regulator of the renin-angiotensin system, together with implications for the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic and associated cardiovascular diseases.\n","id":"PMC7188049","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Lippincott Williams &amp;

propensity score matching was performed.\n Multivariate logistic regression analysis was done to identify predictors of mortality.\n We identified 41,290 hospitalizations for stress cardiomyopathy, including 1665 patients with concurrent diagnosis of COVID-19. The female preponderance was significantly lower in patients with stress cardiomyopathy and COVID-19. Patients with concomitant COVID-19 were more likely to be African American, diabetic and have chronic kidney disease.\n After propensity matching, the incidence of complications, including acute kidney injury (AKI), AKI requiring dialysis, coagulopathy, sepsis, cardiogenic shock, cases with prolonged intubation of &gt;24 h, requirement of vasopressor and inpatient mortality, were noted to be significantly higher in patients with COVID-19. Concomitant COVID-19 infection was independently associated with worse outcomes and increased mortality in patients hospitalized with stress cardiomyopathy.\n","id":"PMC9749379","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Elsevier Inc.","authors":[{"firstname":"Adrija","surname":"Hajra","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Aaqib","surname":"Malik","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Dhrubajyoti","surname":"Bandyopadhyay","email":"NULL","contributions":"3"},{"firstname":"Akshay","surname":"Goel","email":"NULL","contributions":"3"},{"firstname":"Ameesh","surname":"Isath","email":"NULL","contributions":"3"},{"firstname":"Rahul","surname":"Gupta","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Suraj","surname":"Krishnan","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Devesh","surname":"Rai","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Chayakrit","surname":"Krittanawong","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Salim S.","surname":"Virani","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Gregg C.","surname":"Fonarow","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Carl J.","surname":"Lavie","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1016/j.mvr.2020.104023","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Cardiovascular diseases and metabolic abnormalities associated with obesity: What is the role of inflammatory responses?

trends and predictors of in-hospital death in patients with COVID-19 and PE in Germany.\n\n\nMethods\nWe used a German nationwide inpatient sample to analyse data on hospitalisations among COVID-19 patients with and without PE during 2020, and to detect changes in PE prevalence and case fatality in comparison with 2019.\nResults\nWe analysed 176?137 COVID-19 hospitalisations in 2020; PE was

syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), remains a global health burden.\n Obesity, a metabolic syndrome affecting one-third of the population, has proven to be a major risk factor for COVID-19 severe complications.\n Several studies have identified metabolic signatures and disrupted metabolic pathways associated with COVID-19, however there are no reports evaluating the role of obesity in the COVID-19 metabolic regulation.\n In this study we highlight the involvement of obesity metabolically in affecting SARS-CoV-2 infection and the consequent health complications, mainly cardiovascular disease.\n We measured one hundred and forty-four (144) metabolites using ultra high-performance liquid chromatography-quadrupole time of flight mass spectrometry (UHPLC-QTOF-MS) to identify metabolic changes in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection, in lean and obese COVID-19 positive (n=82) and COVID-19 negative (n=24) patients.\n The identified metabolites are found to be mainly correlating with glucose, energy and steroid metabolisms.\n Further data analysis indicated twelve (12) significantly yet differentially abundant metabolites associated with viral infection and health complications, in COVID-19 obese patients.\n Two of the detected metabolites, n6-acetyl-l-lysine and p-cresol, are detected only among the COVID-19 cohort, exhibiting significantly higher levels in COVID-19 obese patients when compared to COVID-19 lean patients.\n These metabolites have important roles in viral entry and could explain the increased susceptibility of obese patients.\n On the same note, a set of six metabolites associated with antiviral and anti-inflammatory functions displayed significantly lower abundance in COVID-19 obese patients.\n In conclusion, this report highlights the plasma metabolome of COVID-19 obese patients as a metabolic feature and signature to help improve clinical outcomes.\n We propose n6-acetyl-l-lysine and p-cresol as potential metabolic markers which warrant further investigations to better understand their involvement in different metabolic pathways in COVID-19.","id":"PMC9161728","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Frontiers Media

Protein Complex Formation Increases the Risk of SARS-CoV-2 Spike Protein-Induced Cardiomyocyte Dysfunction through ACE2 Upregulation","abstract":"Myocardial damage caused by the newly emerged coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) infection is one of the key determinants of COVID-19 severity and mortality.\n SARS-CoV-2 entry to host cells is initiated by binding with its receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) 2, and the ACE2 abundance is thought to reflect the susceptibility to infection.\n Here, we report that ibudilast, which we previously identified as a potent inhibitor of protein complex between transient receptor potential canonical (TRPC) 3 and NADPH oxidase (Nox) 2, attenuates the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein pseudovirus-evoked contractile and metabolic dysfunctions of neonatal rat cardiomyocytes (NRCMs).\n Epidemiologically reported risk factors of severe COVID-19, including cigarette sidestream smoke (CSS) and anti-cancer drug treatment, commonly upregulate ACE2 expression level, and these were suppressed by inhibiting TRPC3-Nox2 complex formation.\n Exposure of NRCMs to SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus, as well as CSS and doxorubicin (Dox), induces ATP release through pannexin-1 hemi-channels, and this ATP release potentiates pseudovirus entry to NRCMs and human iPS cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPS-CMs).\n As the pseudovirus entry followed by production of reactive oxygen species was attenuated by inhibiting TRPC3-Nox2 complex in hiPS-CMs, we suggest that TRPC3-Nox2 complex formation triggered by panexin1-mediated ATP release participates in exacerbation of myocardial damage by amplifying ACE2-dependent SARS-CoV-2

preferentially to triglyceride-rich, very low density lipoproteins, leading to downregulation of LDL receptors).\n ApoE4 also increases the risk for neurodegenerative diseases, decreases their age of onset, or alters their progression.\n ApoE4 likely causes neurodegeneration secondary to its abnormal structure, caused by an interaction between its carboxyl- and amino-terminal domains, called domain interaction.\n When neurons are stressed or injured, they synthesize apoE to redistribute cholesterol for neuronal repair or remodeling.\n However, because of its altered structure, neuronal apoE4 undergoes neuron-specific proteolysis, generating neurotoxic fragments (12–29 kDa) that escape the secretory pathway and cause mitochondrial dysfunction and cytoskeletal alterations, including tau phosphorylation.\n ApoE4-associated pathology can be prevented by small-molecule structure correctors that block domain interaction by converting apoE4 to a molecule that resembles apoE3 both

pathogenesis of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and multiorgan failure in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).\n However, the molecular mechanisms underlying endothelial activation in COVID-19 patients remain unclear.\n In this study, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) viral proteins that potently activate human endothelial cells were screened to elucidate the molecular mechanisms involved in endothelial activation.\n It was found that nucleocapsid protein (NP) of SARS-CoV-2 significantly activated human endothelial cells through Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2)/NF-?B and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathways.\n Moreover, by screening a natural microbial compound library containing 154 natural compounds, simvastatin was identified as a potent inhibitor of NP-induced endothelial activation.\n Remarkably, though the protein sequences of N proteins from coronaviruses are highly conserved, only NP from SARS-CoV-2 induced endothelial activation.\n The NPs from other coronaviruses such as SARS-CoV, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), HUB1-CoV, and influenza virus H1N1 did not activate endothelial cells.\n These findings are consistent with the results from clinical investigations showing broad endotheliitis and organ injury in severe COVID-19 patients.\n In conclusion, the

using endothelial cell culture and recombinant SARS-CoV-2 spike protein S1 Receptor-Binding Domain (Spike).\n Mouse brain microvascular endothelial cells from normal (C57BL/6 mice) and diabetic

endothelial adherens junction protein, JAM-A, a tight junctional protein, Connexin-43, a gap junctional protein, and PECAM-1, were all decreased significantly after Spike treatment in control and to a greater extent, in diabetic cells.\n In control cells, Spike treatment increased association of endothelial junctional proteins with Rab5a, a mediator of the endocytic trafficking compartment.\n In cerebral arteries isolated from control and diabetic animals, Spike protein had a greater effect in downregulating expression of endothelial junctional proteins in arteries from diabetic animals than

Role of Platelet-Endothelium Interactions in the Pathogenesis of Severe SARS-CoV-2 Infection-Associated Myocardial Injury","abstract":"Cardiovascular dysfunction and disease are common and frequently fatal complications of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection.\n Indeed, from early on during the SARS-CoV-2 virus pandemic it was recognized that cardiac complications may occur, even in patients with no underlying cardiac disorders, as part of the acute infection, and that these were associated with more severe disease and increased morbidity and mortality.\n The most common cardiac complication is acute cardiac injury, defined by significant elevation of cardiac troponins.\n The potential mechanisms of cardiovascular complications include direct viral myocardial injury, systemic inflammation induced by the virus, sepsis, arrhythmia, myocardial oxygen supply-demand mismatch, electrolyte abnormalities, and hypercoagulability.\n This review is focused on the prevalence, risk factors and clinical course of COVID-19-related myocardial injury, as well as on current data with regard to disease pathogenesis, specifically the interaction of platelets with the vascular endothelium.\n The latter section includes consideration of the role of SARS-CoV-2 proteins in triggering development of a generalized endotheliitis that, in turn, drives intense activation of platelets.\n Most prominently, SARS-CoV-2–induced endotheliitis involves interaction of the viral spike protein with endothelial angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) together with alternative mechanisms that involve the nucleocapsid and viroporin.\n In addition, the mechanisms by which activated platelets intensify endothelial activation and dysfunction, seemingly driven by release of the platelet-derived calcium-binding proteins, SA100A8 and SA100A9, are described.\n These events create a SARS-CoV-2–driven cycle of intravascular inflammation and coagulation, which contributes significantly to a poor clinical outcome in patients with severe disease.\n","id":"PMC8854752","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Frontiers Media

decrease in physical activity due to mechanized transportations and sedentary form of leisure time activities.\n The syndrome feeds into the spread of the diseases like type 2 diabetes, coronary

increased with aging in the lung, specifically in men; augmented by obese and diabetic conditions in liver, adipose tissue, and pancreatic islets.\n\n IRF1 activation was significantly associated with the impaired insulin signaling in human cells.\n\n IRF1 intron variant rs17622656-A, which was previously reported to be associated with COVID-19 prevalence, increased the IRF1 gene expression in human tissue and was frequently found in American and European population.\n\n Critical patients with COVID-19 exhibited higher IRF1 and lower insulin/IGF signaling pathway genes in the whole blood compared to hospitalized noncritical patients.\n\n Hormonal interventions, such as dihydrotestosterone and dexamethasone, ameliorated the pathological traits in SARS-CoV-2 infectable cells and tissues.\n\n\nConclusions\nThe present study provides the first scientific evidence that SARS-CoV-2 infection impairs the insulin/IGF signaling pathway in respiratory, metabolic, and endocrine cells and tissues.\n\n This feature likely contributes to COVID-19 severity with cell/tissue damage and metabolic abnormalities, which may be exacerbated in older, male, obese, or diabetic patients.\n\n\n","id":"PMC9173833","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"The Authors.

We sought to evaluate the effect of statins on hospitalizations and deaths related to seasonal influenza outbreaks.\n\n\nMethodology/Principal Findings\nWe conducted a population-based cohort study over 10 influenza seasons (1996 to 2006) using linked administrative databases in Ontario, Canada.\n\n We identified all adults older than 65 years who had received an influenza vaccination prior to the start of influenza season and distinguished those also prescribed statins (23%) from those not also prescribed statins (77%).\n\n Propensity-based matching, which accounted for each individual's likelihood of receiving a statin, yielded a final cohort of 2,240,638 patients, exactly half of whom received statins.\n\n Statins were associated with small protective effects against pneumonia hospitalization (odds ratio [OR] 0.92; 95% CI 0.89–0.95), 30-day pneumonia mortality (0.84; 95% CI 0.77–0.91), and all-cause mortality (0.87; 95% CI 0.84–0.89).\n\n These protective effects attenuated substantially after multivariate adjustment and when we excluded multiple observations for each individual, declined over time, differed across propensity score quintiles and risk groups, and were unchanged during post-influenza season periods.\n\n The main limitations of this study were the observational study design, the non-specific outcomes, and the lack of information on medications while hospitalized.\n\n\nConclusions/Significance\nStatin use is associated with a statistically significant but minimal protective effect against influenza morbidity that can easily be attributed to residual confounding.\n\n Public health officials and clinicians should focus on other measures to reduce morbidity and mortality from the next influenza

Signaling via TRIF Contributes to a Protective Innate Immune Response to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus Infection","abstract":"Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are sensors that recognize molecular patterns from viruses, bacteria, and fungi to initiate innate immune responses to invading pathogens.\n The emergence of highly pathogenic coronaviruses severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is a concern for global public health, as there is a lack of efficacious vaccine platforms and antiviral therapeutic strategies.\n Previously, it was shown that MyD88, an adaptor protein necessary for signaling by multiple TLRs, is a required component of the innate immune response to mouse-adapted SARS-CoV infection in vivo.\n Here, we demonstrate that TLR3?/?, TLR4?/?, and TRAM?/? mice are more susceptible to SARS-CoV than wild-type mice but experience only transient weight loss with no mortality in response to infection.\n In contrast, mice deficient in the TLR3/TLR4 adaptor TRIF are highly susceptible to SARS-CoV infection, showing increased weight loss, mortality, reduced lung function, increased lung pathology, and higher viral titers.\n Distinct alterations in inflammation were present in TRIF?/? mice infected with SARS-CoV, including excess infiltration of neutrophils and inflammatory cell types that correlate with increased pathology of other known causes of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), including influenza virus infections.\n Aberrant proinflammatory cytokine, chemokine, and interferon-stimulated gene (ISG) signaling programs were also noted following infection of TRIF?/? mice that were similar to those seen in human patients with poor disease outcome following SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV infection.\n These findings highlight the importance of TLR adaptor signaling in generating a balanced protective innate immune response to highly pathogenic

Mouse-Adapted SARS-CoV","abstract":"A novel human coronavirus, SARS-CoV, emerged suddenly in 2003, causing approximately 8000 human cases and more than 700 deaths worldwide.\n Since most animal models fail to faithfully recapitulate the clinical course of SARS-CoV in humans, the virus and host factors that mediate disease pathogenesis remain unclear.\n Recently, our laboratory and others developed a recombinant mouse-adapted SARS-CoV (rMA15) that was lethal in BALB/c mice.\n In contrast, intranasal infection of young 10-week-old C57BL/6 mice with rMA15 results in a nonlethal infection characterized by high titer replication within the lungs, lung inflammation, destruction of lung tissue, and loss of body weight, thus providing a useful model to identify host mediators of protection.\n Here, we report that mice deficient in MyD88 (MyD88?/?), an adapter protein that mediates Toll-like receptor (TLR), IL-1R, and IL-18R signaling, are far more susceptible to rMA15 infection.\n The genetic absence of MyD88 resulted in enhanced pulmonary pathology and greater than 90% mortality by day 6 post-infection.\n MyD88?/? mice had significantly higher viral loads in lung tissue throughout the course of infection.\n Despite increased viral loads, the expression of multiple proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines within lung tissue and recruitment of inflammatory monocytes/macrophages to the lung was severely impaired in MyD88?/? mice compared to wild-type mice.\n Furthermore, mice deficient in chemokine receptors that contribute to monocyte recruitment to the lung were more susceptible to rMA15-induced disease and exhibited severe lung pathology similar to that seen in MyD88?/?mice.\n These data suggest that MyD88-mediated innate immune signaling and

in development and progression of lung cancer, through cellular and molecular mechanisms which at least in part overlap with proinflammatory pathways.\n Simvastatin is a statin with pleiotropic effects that can also act as an anti-oxidant agent, and these pharmacologic properties may contribute to its potential anti-cancer activity.\n Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate, in the human lung adenocarcinoma cell line GLC-82, the effects of a 24-hour treatment with simvastatin on hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)-induced changes in cell viability, ERK phosphorylation, matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) expression, innate immunity signaling, NF-?B activation and IL-8 secretion.\n Cell counting was performed after trypan blue staining, cell proliferation was assessed using MTT assay, and apoptosis was evaluated through caspase-3 activation and Tunel assay.\n Western blotting was used to analyze protein extracts, and IL-8 release into cell culture supernatants was assessed by ELISA.\n Our results show that simvastatin (30 ?M) significantly (P &lt;0.01) inhibited the proliferative effect of H2O2 (0.5 mM) and its stimulatory actions on ERK1/2 phosphorylation, NF-?B activation and IL-8 production.\n Furthermore, simvastatin decreased H2O2-mediated induction of the cellular expression of MMP-2 and MMP-9, as well as of several components of the signaling complex activated by innate immune responses, including MyD88, TRAF2, TRAF6 and TRADD.\n In conclusion, these findings suggest that simvastatin could play a role in prevention and treatment of lung cancer via

in rats, and to explore the effects of ACE2 and rosuvastatin in restenosis.\n\n\nMethods\nThirty-six Wistar rats were randomly allocated into three groups: control group (n = 12), surgery group (n = 12), and statin group (n = 12).\n\n Aortic endothelial denudation of rats was performed using 2F balloon catheters.\n\n At days 14 and 28 after injury, aortic arteries were harvested to examine the following.\n\n Intimal thickening was examined by hematoxylin and eosin staining.\n\n We measured angiotensin II (Ang II) and angiotensin 1-7 (Ang-[1–7]) levels by a radioimmunological method or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.\n\n Protein and mRNA expression of ACE2 and Ang II type 1 receptor (AT1) were investigated by immunohistochemistry, Western blots, and Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR).\n\n We measured changes in proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) by immunohistochemistry.\n\n The level of phosphorylated extracellular signal regulated kinase 1/2 (P-ERK1/2) was evaluated by Western blotting.\n\n\nResults\nProliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) and intimal thickening were higher at day 14 after vascular balloon injury in the surgery group compared with the control group.\n\n Proliferation of VSMC was decreased by day 28 after injury, while intimal thickening continued.\n\n With rosuvastatin treatment, the extent of VSMC proliferation and intimal thickening was reduced at day 14 and 28 after injury.\n\n Ang II and P-ERK levels were significantly increased, Ang-(1–7) levels were significantly decreased, mRNA and protein expressions of ACE2 were significantly decreased, and AT1 expression was significantly increased at days 14 and 28 after vascular balloon injury in the surgery group compared with the control group.\n\n PCNA expression was higher in the surgery group than in the control group, and it was significantly decreased after being given rosuvastatin.\n\n Expression of ACE2 mRNA and protein, and Ang-(1–7) levels were significantly increased, while AT1 expression and levels of Ang II and P-ERK were significantly decreased in the statin group compared with the surgery group.\n\n\nConclusions\nExpression of ACE2 mRNA and protein is decreased in the process of intimal thickening after balloon injury.\n\n The inhibitory effect of rosuvastatin on intimal thickening is related to upregulation of ACE2, an increase in Ang-(1–7), downregulation of AT1, and activation of the P-ERK pathway.\n\n\n","id":"PMC3708055","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Science

studies have validated algorithms for identifying health events in the DNPR, but the reports are fragmented and no overview exists.\n\n\nObjectives\nTo review the content, data quality, and research potential of the DNPR.\n\n\nMethods\nWe examined the setting, history, aims, content, and classification systems of the DNPR.\n\n We searched PubMed and the Danish Medical Journal to create a bibliography of validation studies.\n\n We included also studies that were referenced in retrieved papers or known to us beforehand.\n\n Methodological considerations related to DNPR data were reviewed.\n\n\nResults\nDuring 1977–2012, the DNPR registered 8,085,603 persons, accounting for 7,268,857 inpatient, 5,953,405 outpatient, and 5,097,300 emergency department contacts.\n\n The DNPR provides nationwide longitudinal registration of detailed administrative and clinical data.\n\n It has recorded information on all patients discharged from Danish nonpsychiatric hospitals since 1977 and on psychiatric inpatients and emergency department and outpatient specialty clinic contacts since 1995. For each patient contact, one primary and optional secondary diagnoses are recorded according to the International Classification of Diseases.\n\n The DNPR provides a data source to identify diseases, examinations, certain in-hospital medical treatments, and surgical procedures.\n\n Long-term temporal trends in hospitalization and treatment rates can be studied.\n\n The positive predictive values of diseases and treatments vary widely (&lt;15%–100%).\n\n The DNPR data are linkable at the patient level with data from other Danish administrative registries, clinical registries, randomized controlled trials, population surveys, and epidemiologic field studies – enabling researchers to reconstruct individual life and health trajectories for an entire population.\n\n\nConclusion\nThe DNPR is a valuable tool for epidemiological research.\n\n However, both its strengths and limitations must be considered when interpreting research results, and continuous validation of its clinical data is essential.\n\n\n","id":"PMC4655913","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Dove Medical

Danish National Patient Registry (DNPR).\n\n\nPatients and Methods\nBased on discharge summaries and brain imaging reports, we estimated the positive predictive value (PPV) of a first-ever diagnosis code for ICH (ICD-10, code I61) for all patients in the Region of Southern Denmark (1.2 million) during 2009–2017 according to either DNPR or DSR.\n\n We estimated PPVs for any non-traumatic ICH (a-ICH) and spontaneous ICH (s-ICH) alone (ie, without underlying structural cause).\n\n We also calculated the sensitivity of these diagnoses in each of the registers.\n\n Finally, we classified the location of verified s-ICH.\n\n\nResults\nA total of 3,956 patients with ICH diagnosis codes were studied (DSR only: 87; DNPR only: 1,513; both registries: 2,356).\n\n In the DSR, the PPVs were 86.5% (95% CI=85.1–87.8) for a-ICH and 81.8% (95% CI=80.2–83.3) for s-ICH.\n\n The PPVs in DNPR (discharge code, primary diagnostic position) were 76.2% (95% CI=74.7–77.6) for a-ICH and 70.2% (95% CI=68.6–71.8) for s-ICH.\n\n Sensitivity for a-ICH and s-ICH was 76.4% (95% CI=74.8–78.0) and 78.7% (95% CI=77.1–80.2) in DSR, and 87.3% (95% CI=86.0–88.5) and 87.7% (95% CI=86.3–88.9) in DNPR.\n\n The location of verified s-ICH was lobar (39%), deep (33.6%), infratentorial (13.2%), large unclassifiable (11%), isolated intraventricular (1.9%), or unclassifiable due to insufficient information (1.3%).\n\n\nConclusion\nThe validity of a-ICH diagnoses is high in both registries.\n\n For s-ICH, PPV was higher in DSR, while sensitivity was higher in DNPR.\n\n The location of s-ICH was similar

health authorities lack recommendations on scalable approaches to defining and monitoring the occurrence and severity of bleeding in populations prescribed antithrombotic therapy.\n\n\nMethods\nid='Par2'>We examined linked primary care, hospital admission and death registry electronic health records (CALIBER 1998–2010, England) of patients with newly diagnosed atrial fibrillation, acute myocardial infarction, unstable angina or stable angina with the aim to develop algorithms for bleeding events.\n\n Using the developed bleeding phenotypes, Kaplan-Meier plots were used to estimate the incidence of bleeding events and we used Cox regression models to assess the prognosis for all-cause mortality, atherothrombotic events and further bleeding.\n\n\nResults\nid='Par3'>We present electronic health record phenotyping algorithms for bleeding based on bleeding diagnosis in primary or hospital care, symptoms, transfusion, surgical procedures and haemoglobin values.\n\n In validation of the phenotype, we estimated a positive predictive value of 0.88 (95% CI 0.64, 0.99) for hospitalised bleeding.\n\n Amongst 128,815 patients, 27,259 (21.2%) had at least 1 bleeding event, with 5-year risks of bleeding of 29.1%, 21.9%, 25.3% and 23.4% following diagnoses of atrial fibrillation, acute myocardial infarction, unstable angina

conducted on research databases that only cover parts of Denmark, and regional differences could potentially threaten these studies’ external validity.\n\n The aim of this study was to assess sociodemographic and health related homogeneity of the five Danish regions.\n\n\nMethods\nWe obtained descriptive data for the five Danish regions, using publicly available data sources: Statbank Denmark, the Danish Ministry of Economic Affairs, and Medstat.\n\ndk.\n\n These data sources comprise aggregate data from four different nationwide registers: The Danish National Patient Register, The Danish Civil Registration System, The Danish Register of Medicinal Product Statistics, and The Danish National Health Service Register for Primary Care.\n\n We compared the Danish regions regarding demographic and socioeconomic characteristics, health care utilization, and use of medication.\n\n For each characteristic, one-year prevalence was obtained and analyses were performed for 2013 and 2008 to account for possible change over time.\n\n\nResults\nIn 2013, 5,602,628 persons were living in Denmark.\n\n The mean age was 40.7 years in the entire Danish population and ranged between 39.6 to 42.4 years in the five regions (coefficient of variation between regions [CV] = 0.028).\n\n The proportion of women in Denmark was 50.4% (CV = 0.009).\n\n The proportion of residents with low education level was 28.7% (CV = 0.051).\n\n The annual number of GP contacts was 7.1 (range: 6.7–7.4, CV = 0.040), and 114 per 1,000 residents were admitted to the hospital (range: 101–131, CV = 0.107).\n\n The annual number of persons redeeming a prescription of any medication was 723 per 1,000 residents (range: 718–743, CV = 0.016).\n\n Analyses for 2008 showed comparable levels of homogeneity as for 2013.\nConclusions\nWe found substantial homogeneity between all of the five Danish regions with regard to sociodemographic and health related characteristics.\n\n Epidemiologic

Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM) codes for identifying acute hemorrhagic stroke in Taiwan’s National Health Insurance claims database has not been assessed.\n\n This study aimed to construct and validate the case definitions for acute hemorrhagic stroke based on ICD-10-CM diagnostic codes.\n\n\nPatients and Methods\nFrom January 2018 to December 2019, all inpatient records with ICD-10-CM code of I60 or I61 in any field of the discharge diagnoses were retrieved from the hospitalization claims data and all hospitalizations with a final diagnosis of subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) or intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) were identified from the stroke registry databases.\n\n The clinical diagnosis in the stroke registry was treated as the reference standard.\n\n For hospitalizations not recorded in the stroke registry, manual review of the medical records and images was done to ascertain the diagnosis.\n\n The positive predictive value (PPV) and sensitivity of various case definitions for acute hemorrhagic stroke were estimated.\n\n\nResults\nAmong the 983 hospitalizations, 860, 111, and 12 were determined to be true-positive, false-positive, and false-negative episodes of acute hemorrhagic stroke, respectively.\n\n The PPV and sensitivity of the ICD-10-CM codes of I60 or I61 for identifying acute hemorrhagic stroke were 88.6% and 98.6%, respectively.\n\n The PPV increased to 98.2%, whereas the sensitivity decreased to 93.1% when acute hemorrhagic stroke was defined as hospitalizations in which the primary diagnosis field contained I60 or I61. Hemorrhagic transformation of ischemic stroke and concomitant cerebrovascular diseases other than SAH or ICH were the main reasons for a false-positive and false-negative diagnosis of acute hemorrhagic stroke, respectively.\n\n\nConclusion\nThis study demonstrated the performance of ICD-10-CM codes for identifying acute hemorrhagic stroke and may offer a reference for future claims-based stroke

Danish National Patient Registry (DNPR).\n\n\nPatients and methods\nWe estimated the positive predictive value (PPV) of ICH diagnoses for a sample of 500 patients from the DSR (patients recorded under ICH diagnosis) and DNPR (International Classification of Diseases, version 10, code I61) during 2010–2015, using discharge summaries and brain imaging reports (minimal data).\n\n We estimated PPVs for any ICH (a-ICH) and spontaneous ICH (s-ICH) alone.\n\n Furthermore, we assessed PPVs according to whether patients were recorded in both or only one of the registries.\n\n Finally, in a subsample with ICH diagnoses with access to full medical records and original imaging studies (extensive data, n=100), we compared s-ICH diagnosis and hemorrhage location after use of extensive vs minimal data.\n\n\nResults\nIn the DSR, the PPVs were 94% (95% CI, 91%–96%) for a-ICH and 85% (95% CI, 81%–88%) for s-ICH.\n\n In the DNPR, the PPVs were 88% (95% CI, 84%–91%) for a-ICH and 75% (95% CI, 70%–79%) for s-ICH.\n\n PPVs for s-ICH for patients recorded in both registries, DSR only, and DNPR only were 86% (95% CI, 82–99), 80% (95%CI, 71–87), and 49% (95%CI, 39–59), respectively.\n\n Evaluation of extensive vs minimal data verified s-ICH diagnosis in 98% and hemorrhage location in 94%.\n\n\nConclusion\nThe validity of a-ICH diagnoses in DSR and DNPR is sufficiently high to support their use in epidemiologic studies.\n\n For s-ICH, validity was high in DSR.\n\n In DNPR, s-ICH validity was lower, markedly so for the small subgroup of patients only recorded in this registry.\n\n

Among them, we randomly selected 200 who had an outpatient gastroscopy at the time of ulcer diagnosis.\n\n We reviewed the findings from these gastroscopies to confirm the presence of peptic ulcer and its location.\n\n We calculated PPVs and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of gastric and duodenal ulcer diagnoses, using descriptions from the gastroscopic examinations as standard reference.\n\n\nResults\nIn total, 182 records (91%) were available for review.\n\n The overall PPV of peptic ulcer diagnoses in DNPR was 95.6% (95% CI 91.5–98.1), with PPVs of 90.3% (95% CI 82.4–95.5) for gastric ulcer diagnoses, and 94.4% (95% CI 87.4–98.2) for duodenal ulcer diagnoses.\n\n PPVs were constant over time.\n\n\nConclusion\nThe PPV of uncomplicated peptic ulcer diagnoses in the DNPR is high, and the location of the ulcers is registered correctly in most cases, indicating that the diagnoses are useful for research purposes.\n\n\n","id":"PMC5426472","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Dove Medical Press","authors":[{"firstname":"Søren","surname":"Viborg","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Kirstine Kobberøe","surname":"Søgaard","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Peter","surname":"Jepsen","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"10.1001/archinte.167.3.239","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Comparison of outcomes among patients randomized to warfarin therapy according to anticoagulant control","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]}]},{"doi":"10.1177/1403494810394717","date":"1970-01-01","title":"The Danish national prescription registry","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[],"References depth 2":[]},{"doi":"10.1177/1403494810387965","date":"1970-01-01","title":"The Danish civil registration system","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[],"References depth 2":[]},{"doi":"10.1177/1403494810394715","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Danish education registers","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[],"References depth 2":[]},{"doi":"10.1177/1403494811405098","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Danish registers on personal income and transfer payments","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[],"References depth 2":[]},{"doi":"10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.107.720847","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Diabetes patients requiring glucose-lowering therapy and nondiabetics with a prior myocardial infarction carry the same cardiovascular risk: a population study of 3.3 million people","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[],"References depth 2":[]},{"doi":"10.1136/bmj.d124","date":"2010-12-28","title":"Validation of risk stratification schemes for predicting stroke and thromboembolism in patients with atrial fibrillation: nationwide cohort study","abstract":"Objectives To evaluate the individual risk factors composing the CHADS2 (Congestive heart failure, Hypertension, Age?75 years, Diabetes, previous Stroke) score and the CHA2DS2-VASc (CHA2DS2-Vascular disease, Age 65-74 years, Sex category) score and to calculate the capability of the schemes to predict thromboembolism.\n","id":"PMC3031123","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"BMJ Publishing Group Ltd.","authors":[{"firstname":"Jonas Bjerring","surname":"Olesen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Gregory Y H","surname":"Lip","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Morten Lock","surname":"Hansen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Peter Riis","surname":"Hansen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Janne Schurmann","surname":"Tolstrup","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jesper","surname":"Lindhardsen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Christian","surname":"Selmer","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ole","surname":"Ahlehoff","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Anne-Marie Schjerning","surname":"Olsen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Gunnar Hilmar","surname":"Gislason","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Christian","surname":"Torp-Pedersen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}],"References depth 2":[{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Liu L, Forman S, Barton B.

Demographic data, symptoms, laboratory values, comorbidities, treatments, and clinical outcomes were all collected.\n\n Data were compared between survivors and non-survivors.\n\n The primary outcome was 28-day mortality, as of Feb 9, 2020. Secondary outcomes included incidence of SARS-CoV-2-related acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and the proportion of patients requiring mechanical ventilation.\n\n\nFindings\nOf 710 patients

China.\n\n We aimed to further clarify the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of 2019-nCoV pneumonia.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this retrospective, single-centre study, we included all confirmed cases of 2019-nCoV in Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital from Jan 1 to Jan 20, 2020. Cases were confirmed by real-time RT-PCR and were analysed for epidemiological, demographic, clinical, and radiological features and laboratory data.\n\n Outcomes were followed up until Jan 25, 2020.\nFindings\nOf the 99 patients with 2019-nCoV pneumonia, 49 (49%) had a history of exposure to the Huanan seafood market.\n\n The average age of the patients was 55·5 years (SD 13·1), including 67 men and 32 women.\n\n 2019-nCoV was detected in all patients by real-time RT-PCR.\n\n 50 (51%) patients had chronic diseases.\n\n Patients had clinical manifestations of fever (82 [83%] patients), cough (81 [82%] patients), shortness of breath (31 [31%] patients), muscle ache (11 [11%] patients), confusion (nine [9%] patients), headache (eight [8%] patients), sore throat (five [5%] patients), rhinorrhoea (four [4%] patients), chest pain (two [2%] patients), diarrhoea (two [2%] patients), and nausea and vomiting (one [1%] patient).\n\n According to imaging examination, 74 (75%) patients showed bilateral pneumonia, 14 (14%) patients showed multiple mottling and ground-glass opacity, and one (1%) patient had pneumothorax.\n\n 17 (17%) patients developed acute respiratory distress syndrome and, among them, 11 (11%) patients worsened in a short period of time and died of multiple organ failure.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe 2019-nCoV infection was of clustering onset, is more likely to affect older males with comorbidities, and can result in severe and even fatal respiratory diseases such as acute respiratory distress syndrome.\n\n In general, characteristics of patients who died were in line with the MuLBSTA score, an early warning model for predicting mortality in viral pneumonia.\n\n Further investigation is needed to explore the applicability of the MuLBSTA score in predicting the risk of mortality in 2019-nCoV infection.\n\n\nFunding\nNational Key R&amp;D Program of China.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7135076","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Elsevier

the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatment and clinical outcomes of these patients.\n\n\nMethods\nAll patients with suspected 2019-nCoV were admitted to a designated hospital in Wuhan.\n\n We prospectively collected and analysed data on patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection by real-time RT-PCR and next-generation sequencing.\n\n Data were obtained with standardised data collection forms shared by WHO and the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium from electronic medical records.\n\n Researchers also directly communicated with patients or their families to ascertain epidemiological and symptom data.\n\n Outcomes were also compared between patients who had been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and those who had not.\n\n\nFindings\nBy Jan 2, 2020, 41 admitted hospital patients had been identified as having laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection.\n\n Most of the infected patients were men (30 [73%] of 41); less than half had underlying diseases (13 [32%]), including diabetes (eight [20%]), hypertension (six [15%]), and cardiovascular disease (six [15%]).\n\n Median age was 49·0 years (IQR 41·0–58·0).\n\n 27 (66%) of 41 patients had been exposed to Huanan seafood market.\n\n One family cluster was found.\n\n Common symptoms at onset of illness were fever (40 [98%] of 41 patients), cough (31 [76%]), and myalgia or fatigue (18 [44%]); less common symptoms were sputum production (11 [28%] of 39), headache (three [8%] of 38), haemoptysis (two [5%] of 39), and diarrhoea (one [3%] of 38).\n\n Dyspnoea developed in 22 (55%) of 40 patients (median time from illness onset to dyspnoea 8·0 days [IQR 5·0–13·0]).\n\n 26 (63%) of 41 patients had lymphopenia.\n\n All 41 patients had pneumonia with abnormal findings on chest CT.\n\n Complications included acute respiratory distress syndrome (12 [29%]), RNAaemia (six [15%]), acute cardiac injury (five [12%]) and secondary infection (four [10%]).\n\n 13 (32%) patients were admitted to an ICU and six (15%) died.\n\n Compared with non-ICU patients, ICU patients had higher plasma levels of IL2, IL7, IL10, GSCF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNF?.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe 2019-nCoV infection caused clusters of severe respiratory illness similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and was associated with ICU admission and high mortality.\n\n Major gaps in our knowledge of the origin, epidemiology, duration of human transmission, and clinical spectrum of disease need fulfilment by future

Patient outcomes were followed until February 19, 2020. Patients were analyzed for clinical features, laboratory parameters (including liver function tests), medications, and length of hospital stay.\n\n Abnormal liver function was defined as increased levels of alanine and aspartate aminotransferase, gamma glutamyltransferase, alkaline phosphatase, and total bilirubin.\n\n\nResults\nFifty-five patients (37.2%) had abnormal liver function at hospital admission; 14.5% of these patients had high fever (14.5%), compared with 4.3% of patients with normal liver function (P = .\n\n027).\n\n Patients with abnormal liver function were more likely to be male, and had higher levels of procalcitonin and C-reactive protein.\n\n There was no statistical difference between groups in medications taken before hospitalization; a significantly higher proportion of patients with abnormal liver function (57.8%) had received lopinavir/ritonavir after admission compared to patients with normal liver function (31.3%).\n\n Patients with abnormal liver

hepatic effects: Newer data, implications, and changing recommendations","abstract":"Hepatic adverse effects are one of the most commonly known adverse effects reported with statins.\n Frequently, fear of serious hepatic effects contributes to underutilization of statins as well as unnecessary discontinuation of its use among those indicated.\n There are changing data on the occurrence of these negative hepatic effects, recommendations on their actual risk, monitoring required, and safety of use in those with preexisting hepatic disorders.\n Based on reviewed literature, statins appear to be associated with a very low risk of true and serious liver injury.\n Unprecedented fears regarding hepatic adverse effects of statins among prescribers and patients can deny patients of the significant benefits of these agents.\n Routine periodic monitoring of liver function does not appear to detect or prevent serious liver injury and hence may not be indicated.\n But the potential of statins to cause significant and serious hepatic effects should not be overlooked in daily clinical practice.\n Statin use need not be avoided in patients with preexisting liver dysfunction such as nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, compensated cirrhosis, and compensated chronic liver disease if its use is clearly indicated.\n Physician's judgment based on the risk and benefit for an individual patient does matter when a strategy is chosen regarding the use of statins and monitoring patients while on statins.\n","id":"PMC4766774","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Medknow Publications &amp; Media Pvt

as key sentinel and effector cells in infectious diseases, especially critical in bridging hemostatic, inflammatory, and immune continuums.\n Upon intravascular pathogen invasion, platelets can directly sense viral, parasitic, and bacterial infections through pattern recognition receptors and integrin receptors or pathogen: immunoglobulin complexes through Fc and complement receptors—although our understanding of these interactions remains incomplete.\n Constantly scanning for areas of injury or inflammation as they circulate in the vasculature, platelets also indirectly respond to pathogen invasion through interactions with leukocytes and the endothelium.\n Following antigen recognition, platelets often become activated.\n Through a diverse repertoire of mechanisms, activated platelets can directly sequester or kill pathogens, or facilitate pathogen clearance by activating macrophages and neutrophils, promoting neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) formation, forming platelet aggregates and microthrombi.\n At times, however, platelet activation may also be injurious to the host, exacerbating inflammation and promoting endothelial damage and thrombosis.\n There are many gaps in our understandings of the role of platelets in infectious diseases.\n However, with the emergence of advanced technologies, our knowledge is increasing.\n In the current review, we mainly discuss these evolving roles of platelets under four different infectious pathogen infections, of which are dengue, malaria, Esterichia coli (E.\n coli) and staphylococcus aureus S.\n

enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for the quantification of citrullinated histone H3 as a marker for neutrophil extracellular traps in human plasma","abstract":"There is an emerging interest in the diverse functions of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) in a variety of disease settings.\n However, data on circulating NETs rely largely upon surrogate NET markers such as cell-free DNA, nucleosomes, and NET-associated enzymes.\n Citrullination of histone H3 by peptidyl arginine deiminase 4 (PAD4) is central for NET formation, and citrullinated histone H3 (H3Cit) is considered a NET-specific biomarker.\n We therefore aimed to optimize and validate a new enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to quantify the levels of H3Cit in human plasma.\n A standard curve made of in vitro PAD4-citrullinated histones H3 allows for the quantification of H3Cit in plasma using an anti-histone antibody as capture antibody and an anti-histone H3 citrulline antibody for detection.\n The assay was evaluated for linearity, stability, specificity, and precision on plasma samples obtained from a human model of inflammation before and after lipopolysaccharide injection.\n The results revealed linearity and high specificity demonstrated by the inability of detecting non-citrullinated histone H3. Coefficients of variation for intra- and inter-assay variability ranged from 2.1 to 5.1% and from 5.8 to 13.5%, respectively, allowing for a high precision.\n Furthermore, our results support an inflammatory induction of a systemic NET burden by showing, for the first time, clear intra-individual elevations of plasma H3Cit in a human model of lipopolysaccharide-induced inflammation.\n Taken together, our work demonstrates the development of a new method for the quantification of H3Cit by ELISA that can reliably be used for the detection of NETs in human plasma.\n","id":"PMC5440486","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Springer US","authors":[{"firstname":"Charlotte","surname":"Thålin","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Maud","surname":"Daleskog","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Sophie Paues","surname":"Göransson","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Daphne","surname":"Schatzberg","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Julie","surname":"Lasselin","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Ann-Charlotte","surname":"Laska","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Anders","surname":"Kallner","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Thomas","surname":"Helleday","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Håkan","surname":"Wallén","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Mélanie","surname":"Demers","email":"melanie.demers@ki.se","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"10.1038/nm.2847","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Dynamic NETosis is Carried Out by Live Neutrophils in Human and Mouse Bacterial Abscesses and During Severe Gram-Positive Infection","abstract":"id='P1'>Neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) are released, as neutrophils die in vitro, in a process requiring hours, leaving a temporal gap for invasive microbes to exploit.\n Functional neutrophils undergoing NETosis have not been documented.\n During Gram-positive skin infections, we directly visualized live PMN in vivo rapidly releasing NETs, which prevented bacterial dissemination.\n NETosis occurred during crawling thereby casting large areas of NETs.\n NET-releasing PMN developed diffuse decondensed nuclei ultimately becoming devoid of DNA.\n Cells with abnormal nuclei displayed unusual crawling behavior highlighted by erratic pseudopods and hyperpolarization consistent with the nucleus being a fulcrum for crawling.\n A combined requirement of Tlr2 and complement mediated opsonization tightly regulated NET release.\n Additionally live human PMN developed decondensed nuclei and formed NETS in vivo and intact anuclear neutrophils were abundant in Gram-positive human abscesses.\n Therefore early in infection, non-cell death NETosis occurs in vivo during Gram-positive infection in mice and humans.\n","id":"PMC4529131","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"NULL","authors":[{"firstname":"Bryan G.","surname":"Yipp","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Björn","surname":"Petri","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Davide","surname":"Salina","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Craig N.","surname":"Jenne","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Brittney N.

illustrated review focuses on polyphosphate as a potent modulator of the plasma clotting cascade, with possible roles in hemostasis, thrombosis, and inflammation.\n Polyphosphates are highly anionic, linear polymers of inorganic phosphates that are widespread throughout biology.\n Infectious microorganisms accumulate polyphosphates with widely varying polymer lengths (from a few phosphates to over a thousand phosphates long), while activated human platelets secrete polyphosphate with a very narrow size distribution (about 60?100 phosphates long).\n Work from our lab and others has shown that long?chain polyphosphate is a potent trigger of clotting via the contact pathway, while polyphosphate of the size secreted by platelets accelerates factor V activation, blocks the anticoagulant activity of tissue factor pathway inhibitor, promotes factor XI activation by thrombin, and makes fibrin fibrils thicker and more resistant to fibrinolysis.\n Polyphosphate also modulates inflammation by triggering bradykinin release, inhibiting the complement system, and modulating endothelial function.\n Polyphosphate and nucleic acids have similar physical properties and both will trigger the contact pathway—although polyphosphate is orders of magnitude more procoagulant than either DNA or RNA.\n Important caveats in these studies include observations that nucleic acids and polyphosphate may co?purify, and that these preparations can be contaminated with highly procoagulant microparticles if silica?based purification methods are employed.\n Polyphosphate has received attention as a possible therapeutic, with some recent studies exploring the use of polyphosphate in a variety of formulations to control bleeding.\n Other studies are investigating treatments that block polyphosphate function as novel antithrombotics with the possibility of reduced bleeding side effects.\n","id":"PMC6332810","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"John Wiley and Sons

blocking factor XII and abolished in factor XII-deficient plasma but intact in factor VII-deficient plasma.\n Activation of neutrophils simultaneously generated large amount of neutrophil-derived MPs,

neutrophils, was first demonstrated as a host defence against pathogens.\n\n Recently it became clear that NETs are also released in pathological conditions.\n\n NETs released in the blood can activate thrombosis and initiate a cascade of platelet responses.\n\n However, it is not well understood if these responses are mediated through direct or indirect interactions.\n\n We investigated whether cell-free NETs can induce aggregation of washed human platelets in vitro and the contribution of NET-derived extracellular DNA and histones to platelet activation response.\n\n\nMethods\nid='Par2'>Isolated human neutrophils were stimulated with PMA to produce robust and consistent NETs.\n\n Cell-free NETs were isolated and characterised by examining DNA-histone complexes and quantification of neutrophil elastase with ELISA.\n\n NETs were incubated with washed human platelets to assess several platelet activation responses.\n\n Using pharmacological inhibitors, we explored the role of different NET components, as well as main platelet receptors, and downstream signalling pathways involved in NET-induced platelet aggregation.\n\n\nResults\nid='Par3'>Cell-free NETs directly induced dose-dependent platelet aggregation, dense granule secretion and procoagulant phosphatidyl serine exposure on platelets.\n\n Surprisingly, we found that inhibition of NET-derived DNA and histones did not affect NET-induced platelet aggregation or activation.\n\n We further identified the molecular pathways involved in NET-activated platelets.\n\n The most potent single modulator of NET-induced platelet responses included NET-bound cathepsin G, platelet Syk kinase, and P2Y12 and ?IIb?3 receptors.\n\n\nConclusions\nid='Par4'>In vitro-generated NETs can directly induce marked aggregation of washed human platelets.\n\n Pre-treatment of NETs with DNase or heparin did not reduce NET-induced activation or aggregation of human washed platelets.\n\n We further identified the molecular pathways activated in platelets in response to NETs.\n\n Taken together, we conclude that targeting certain platelet activation pathways, rather than the NET scaffold, has a more profound reduction on NET-induced platelet aggregation.\n\n\nElectronic supplementary material\nThe online

haemostasis as a bridging molecule in platelet aggregation, by promoting platelet adhesion to collagen and by protecting von Willebrand factor strings from degradation.\n In blood of patients undergoing surgery and in co-cultures of neutrophils with platelets or ECs, we observed proteolysis of the 185 kDa full-length TSP-1 to a 160-kDa isoform.\n We hypothesized that TSP-1 processing may alter its haemostatic properties.\n Selective enzyme inhibitors in co-cultures revealed that neutrophil proteases elastase and cathepsin G mediate TSP-1 processing.\n The cut site of cathepsin G was mapped to TSP-1 amino acids R237/T238 by Edman sequencing.\n Formation of neutrophil extracellular traps protected TSP-1 from complete degradation and promoted controlled processing to the 160-kDa isoform.\n Haemostatic properties were tested by platelet aggregation, adhesion, coagulation and string formation under flow.\n Platelets from TSP-1 deficient mice did not differ from wild-type in platelet aggregation but showed severe impairment of platelet adhesion to collagen and string formation under flow.\n Reconstitution experiments revealed that the 160-kDa TSP-1 isoform was markedly

dynamically release platelets.\n MKs releasing platelets in the lung are of extrapulmonary origin, such as the BM, where we observed large MKs migrating out of the BM space.\n The lung contribution to platelet biogenesis is substantial with approximately 50% of total platelet production or 10 million platelets per hour.\n Furthermore, we identified populations of mature and immature MKs along with hematopoietic progenitors that reside in the extravascular spaces of the lung.\n Under conditions of thrombocytopenia and relative stem cell deficiency in the BM9, these progenitors can migrate out of the lung, repopulate the BM, completely reconstitute blood platelet counts, and contribute to multiple hematopoietic lineages.\n These results position the lung as a primary site of terminal platelet

VI (GPVI) binds collagen, initiating thrombogenesis, and stabilizes thrombi by binding fibrin.\n\n\nBackground\nPlatelet collagen receptor Glycoprotein VI (GPVI) binds collagen, initiating thrombogenesis, and stabilizes thrombi by binding fibrin.\n\n\nObjectives\nTo determine if GPVI?dimer, GPVI?monomer, or both bind to fibrinogen substrates, and which region common to these substrates contains the interaction site.\n\n\nMethods\nRecombinant GPVI monomeric extracellular domain (GPVI\nex) or dimeric Fc?fusion protein (GPVI?Fc2) binding to immobilized fibrinogen derivatives was measured by ELISA, including competition assays involving collagenous substrates and fibrinogen derivatives.\n\n Flow adhesion was performed with normal or Glanzmann thrombasthenic (GT) platelets over immobilized fibrinogen, with or without anti?GPVI?dimer or anti??IIb?3.\nResults\nUnder static conditions, GPVI\nex did not bind to any fibrinogen substrate.\n\n GPVI?Fc2 exhibited specific, saturable binding to both D?fragment and D?dimer, which was inhibited by mFab?F (anti?GPVI?dimer), but showed low binding to fibrinogen and fibrin under our conditions.\n\n GPVI?Fc2 binding to D?fragment or D?dimer was abrogated by collagen type III, Horm collagen or CRP?XL (crosslinked collagen?related peptide), suggesting proximity between the D?domain and collagen binding sites on GPVI?dimer.\n\n Under low shear, adhesion of normal platelets to D?fragment, D?dimer, fibrinogen and fibrin was inhibited by mFab?F (inhibitor of GPVI?dimer) and abolished by Eptifibatide (inhibitor of ?IIb?3), suggesting that both receptors contribute to thrombus formation on these substrates, but ?IIb?3 makes a greater contribution.\n\n Notably, thrombasthenic platelets showed limited adhesion to fibrinogen substrates under flow, which was further reduced by mFab?F, supporting some independent GPVI?dimer involvement in this interaction.\n\n\nConclusion\nOnly dimeric GPVI interacts with fibrinogen D?domain, at a site proximate to its collagen binding site, to support platelet adhesion/activation/aggregate formation on immobilized fibrinogen and polymerized fibrin.\n\n\n","id":"PMC5838801","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"John Wiley and Sons

These findings, if validated, may further reemphasize administration of statins to patients with diabetes mellitus during the COVID-19 era.\nNonstandard Abbreviations and Acronyms\nCOVID-19\ncoronavirus disease 2019\nIPTW\ninverse probability treatment weighting\nPS\npropensity score\nSARS-CoV-2\nsevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2\nClinical Perspective\nWhat Is New?\nIn this observational study that included 4252 patients admitted with coronavirus disease 2019, those with diabetes mellitus receiving statins had a 12% reduction in the adjusted risk of in-hospital mortality.\nDespite a higher comorbidity burden, patients with diabetes mellitus on statin therapy presented with lower markers of inflammation in comparison with those not receiving statins.\nWhat Are the Clinical Implications?\nThese findings may further strengthen and refocus administration of statins to patients with diabetes mellitus in the coronavirus disease 2019 era.\nCoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has rapidly spread globally. 1 ,  2  Although nearly 80% of cases recover, COVID-19 still appears to retain an elevated mortality with the number of deaths escalating to over 250 000 worldwide through April 2020. 2  The severity of COVID-19 is characterized by a proinflammatory state evident by elevated serum biomarkers of inflammation including C-reactive protein, interleukin-6, and ferritin. 3 ,  4  These biomarkers are predictive of death during SARS-CoV-2 infection. 4  \nStatins have known anti-inflammatory properties 5  and may represent an agent for modulating the host response during COVID-19. 6  Pleotropic effects of statins also reduce reactive oxygen species and platelet reactivity, and acute administration improves survival in proinflammatory states such as myocardial infarction. 7 ,  8  In addition, statins can limit viral endotheliitis, 9  which has been implicated during SARS-CoV-2 infection. 10  On the contrary, animal studies indicate that statins increase membrane-bound angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor, 11  which is a port of entry for SARS-CoV-2, thereby raising concern for statin usage during the COVID-19 pandemic. 12  As statins are one of the most commonly prescribed to patients with cardiovascular disease and diabetes mellitus, we sought to determine if statin use is associated with survival during COVID-19 by evaluating the association of in-hospital mortality and statin therapy.\nMethods\nThe data that form the basis of the presented findings are available from the corresponding author upon reasonable request.\nStudy Population\nA retrospective single-center review of all patients who were admitted to Montefiore Medical Center in the Bronx, New York, with a confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis from March 1, 2020 to May 2, 2020, was conducted. COVID-19 was confirmed by a positive real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction assay. A sample for positive real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction was obtained by either nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal swab. The follow-up period was from March 1, 2020 to May 4, 2020. The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board (2020-11308), and informed consent was waived.\nData Collection, Exposure, and Outcome\nBaseline demographic, clinical, and laboratory variables were retrieved from the electronic medical record system. The exposure was statin administration. Patients were grouped as those who received and those who did not receive a statin during the hospitalization. The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality during the follow-up period.\nStatistical Analysis\nContinuous data are displayed as mean+-SD or median 25% to 75% interquartile range (IQR), and characteristics were compared between statin users and nonusers using the Student t test, or Wilcoxon rank-sum test. Categorical data are shown as percent and were compared by the chi-squared test. As hospital discharge is a competing event with in-hospital mortality, instead of Kaplan-Meier estimates, we used competing events analysis to estimate the cumulative incidence of in-hospital mortality since admission. 13  Patients who remained in the hospital at the end of the follow-up period on May 4, 2020, were censored. The difference in the cumulative incidence of in-hospital mortality was compared between statin users and nonusers separately among patients with and without diabetes mellitus by Fine and Gray's method. 14  \nMultivariable Regression Modeling\nA multivariable regression model with subdistribution hazard ratios (HRs) 13 ,  14  was used to calculate the adjusted HR of in-hospital mortality only for patients with diabetes mellitus that were on a statin in comparison with those not receiving statins. A full model was determined with demographics and clinical and laboratory variables that were independently associated with statin use or in-hospital mortality at a P&lt;0.2. Then a reduced model was derived with all covariates that had a P&lt;0.05. This reduced model included statin use (yes or no), age, sex, history of atherosclerotic heart disease, Charlson comorbidity index, presenting diastolic blood pressure, respiratory rate, pulse oximetry measurement, serum glucose, serum lactic acid, serum creatinine, and intravenous antibiotic use during hospitalization.\nPropensity Score Analyses\nTo limit potential residual confounding by indication, we also used propensity score (PS) matching and inverse probability treatment weighting (IPTW) to examine the association between statin use and in-hospital mortality in a Cox proportional hazards model among patients with diabetes mellitus. 15  Covariate selection for PS matching and IPTW was done in accordance with criteria described previously. 16 ,  17  Variables included for PS matching were true confounders, or those that were associated with the outcome of interest (ie, in-hospital death). We did not include variables that were associated only with exposure (ie, statin use) and not the outcome (ie, in-hospital death), since it has been demonstrated that these covariates increase the variance of the estimated exposure effect without decreasing bias. 16  The covariates in the propensity analyses included age, sex, body mass index, days of symptoms before admission, history of atherosclerotic heart disease, Charlson comorbidity index, presenting diastolic blood pressure, respiratory rate, pulse oximetry measurement, heart rate, serum glucose, lactic acid, serum creatinine, serum troponin levels, usage of angiotensin-converting enzymes inhibitors, usage of angiotensin receptor blockers, serum troponin levels, and intravenous antibiotics during hospitalization. PS matching was carried out through a 1:1 greedy matching algorithm, with a caliper width of 0.1 SD, and through IPTW. The PS and IPTW analyses were carried out using treatment effects in Stata (StataCorp, College Station, TX).\nMissing Data\nThe proportion of patients with diabetes mellitus and missing data for a covariate that was included in multivariable competing risk regression and propensity score models was &lt;5%, with the exception of glucose (9.2%), lactic acid (9.1%), and serum troponin (15.4%). Since troponin was missing in &gt;10% of the patients with diabetes mellitus, we created a categorical variable using quartile cutoff point with an additional category for missing values and added this variable in the PS models. Given a skewed distribution, quartiles 1 and 2 were collapsed as a single category and served as a reference for quartile 3 (intermediate-level troponin), quartile 4 (high-level troponin), and missing troponin categories. The final data set for the multivariable competing risks regression model included 2039 (90%) of the 2266 patients with diabetes mellitus, while the models using PS matching and IPTW included 1902 (84%) of patients with diabetes mellitus.\nA P&lt;0.05 was considered statistically significant. Stata 16 (StataCorp) and R (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria) software was used for all statistical analysis.\nResults\nPatient Characteristics\nOverall, 4252 patients (65+-16 years old; 47% female) were admitted with COVID-19. Thirty-seven percent (n=1570) were Hispanic. Diabetes mellitus (53%), hypertension (72%), and atherosclerotic heart disease (26%) were highly prevalent comorbidities (Table 1). On average, patients presented 3 (IQR, 0-7) days after onset of symptoms and had elevated inflammatory markers including C-reactive protein (10.6; IQR, 4.5-18.9 mg/dL) and ferritin (785; IQR, 369-1607 ng/mL).\nCharacteristics of Patients Admitted With COVID-19\nCharacteristic	All Patients(n=4252)	Statin(n=1355)	No Statin(n=2897)	P Value	 	Age, y	65+-16	69+-12	63+-17	&lt;0.001	 	Female, n (%)	1997 (47)	618 (46)	1379 (47)	0.22	 	Race/Ethnicity, n (%)	0.54	 	Non-Hispanic Black	1561 (37)	510 (38)	1051 (36)		 	Non-Hispanic White	351 (8)	114 (8)	237 (8)		 	Hispanic	1570 (37)	502 (37)	1068 (37)		 	Other*/Unknown	770 (18)	229 (17)	541 (19)		 	Body mass index, kg/m2	28.5 (24.7-33.2)	28 (25-33)	29 (25-33)	0.028	 	Past medical diagnosis, n (%)	 	Diabetes mellitus	2266 (53)	983 (73)	1283 (44)	&lt;0.001	 	Hypertension	3060 (72)	1175 (86)	1885 (65)	&lt;0.001	 	ASHD	1111 (26)	583 (43)	528 (18)	&lt;0.001	 	Lung disease	1203 (28)	458 (34)	745 (26)	&lt;0.001	 	Charlson comorbidity index	3 (2-7)	5 (3-8)	3 (1-5)	&lt;0.001	 	Days from symptoms to presentation	3 (0-7)	2 (0-5)	3 (0-7)	0.015	 	Vital signs at presentation	 	Systolic blood pressure, mm Hg	131 (115-148)	133 (117-151)	129 (113-146)	&lt;0.001	 	Diastolic blood pressure, mm Hg	75 (65-84)	74 (65-83)	75 (65-85)	0.042	 	Heart rate, beats/min	98 (86-112)	95 (82-108)	100 (87-114)	&lt;0.001	 	Oxygen saturation, %	95 (90-98)	95 (92-98)	95 (90-98)	&lt;0.001	 	Respiratory rate, breaths/min	20 (18-22)	20 (18-22)	20 (18-23)	&lt;0.001	 	Temperature,  F	98.9 (98.2-100.1)	98.8 (98.2-100)	99 (98.2-100.1)	0.012	 	Laboratory markers	 	Alanine transaminase, U/L	27 (17-44)	24 (16-38)	29 (18-47)	&lt;0.001	 	Neutrophil count, k/muL	5.7 (3.9-8.4)	5.4 (3.7-7.7)	5.8 (4-8.7)	&lt;0.001	 	Lymphocyte count, k/muL	1 (0.7-1.4)	1 (0.7-1.3)	1 (0.7-1.4)	&lt;0.002	 	Ferritin, ng/mL	785 (369-1607)	710 (355-1464)	816 (389-1703)	0.015	 	Lactate dehydrogenase, U/L	397 (292-547)	370 (285-505)	413 (298-576)	&lt;0.001	 	C-reactive protein, mg/L	10.6 (4.5-18.9)	9.9 (4-17.4)	11.1 (4.7-19.5)	0.005	 	d-dimer, mug/mL	1.84 (0.94-4.2)	1.83 (0.92-3.61)	1.86 (0.94-4.55)	0.17	 	Procalcitonin, ng/mL	0.1 (0.3-0.9)	0.2 (0.1-0.7)	0.3 (0.1-1.1)	0.003	 	Lactic acid, mmole/L	2.1 (1.6-3)	2.1 (1.5-2.8)	2.1 (1.6-3.2)	0.001	 	ProBNP, pg/mL	480 (114-1983)	611 (151-2724)	415 (95-1661)	&lt;0.001	 	Creatinine, mg/dL	1.2 (0.8-2)	1.3 (0.92-2.4)	1.1 (0.8-1.8)	&lt;0.001	 	Glucose, mg/dL	141 (114-207)	153 (117-229)	138 (133-195)	&lt;0.001	 	Troponin T, mg/mL	0.01 (0.01-0.04)	0.01 (0.01-0.05)	0.01 (0.01-0.03)	&lt;0.001	 	Inpatient medications, n (%)	 	ACE inhibitors	282 (6.6)	163 (12)	119 (4)	&lt;0.001	 	ARB	241 (5.7)	124 (9)	117 (4)	&lt;0.001	 	Hydroxycholoroquine	3031 (71)	1007 (74)	2024 (70)	0.003	 	Antibiotics	3352 (76)	1026 (76)	2226 (77)	0.42	 	Intravenous steroids	947 (22)	315 (23)	632 (22)	0.30	 	Statin type, %	 	Atorvastatin		1024 (76)			 	Pravastatin		74 (5)			 	Rosuvastatin		10 (1)			 	Simvastatin		247 (18)			 	\nThe following were the available samples sizes for variables with &gt;5% missing data: alanine transaminase (n=3901), ferritin (n=1663), lactate dehydrogenase (n=2635), C-reactive protein (n=2083), d-dimer (n=1857), procalcitonin (n=1537), lactic acid (n=3705), creatinine (n=4108), glucose (n=3703), and troponin (n=3384).

Those on statin therapy were older (69+-12 versus 63+-17 years; P&lt;0.01) and had a higher Charlson comorbidity index (5; IQR, 3-8 versus 3; IQR, 1-5; P&lt;0.01). Despite a higher comorbidity burden, we observed a lower cumulative in-hospital mortality in those receiving a statin (23% versus 27%; P&lt;0.01). Seventy-six percent of the patients received atorvastatin. Further stratification analysis revealed that this effect was modified by diabetes mellitus. Patient with diabetes mellitus (n=2266) on a statin had a lower cumulative in-hospital mortality (24% versus 39%; P&lt;0.01; Figure [A]), while no difference was noted in patients without diabetes mellitus (20% versus 21%; P=0.82; Figure [B]).\nCumulative incidence of in-hospital mortality during COVID-19 in statin users and nonusers stratified by presence (A) or absence (B) of diabetes mellitus.\nCOVID-19 indicates coronavirus disease 2019.\nDiabetes Mellitus and In-Hospital Mortality\nPatients with diabetes mellitus admitted for COVID-19 were 68+-13 years old, 48% were female, 36% classified as Hispanic, 87% had a history of hypertension, and 36% had atherosclerotic heart disease. Their blood glucose at presentation was 180 (IQR, 120-274 mg/dL), and the glycosylated hemoglobin if available within 3 months before admission was 7.8 (IQR, 6.5%-9.7%; n=507).\nOverall, patients with diabetes mellitus had an in-hospital mortality of 32% over a follow-up period of 5.9 (IQR, 3.4-10.8) days. Those who died in the hospital were older (74+-12 versus 67+-13 years; P&lt;0.01), were more frequently men (57% versus 50%, P&lt;0.01), and had a greater proportion of known atherosclerotic heart disease (44% versus 32%; P&lt;0.01). Nonsurvivors had lower blood pressure, reduced oxygen saturation at presentation, and higher levels of inflammatory biomarkers (Table 2).\nCharacteristics of Survivors and Nonsurvivors Among Patients With Diabetes Mellitus and COVID-19\nCharacteristic	All Patients With Diabetes Mellitus(n=2266)	Survivors(n=1537)	Nonsurvivors(n=729)	P Value*	 	Age, y	68+-13	67+-13	74+-12	&lt;0.001	 	Female, n (%)	1077 (48)	766 (49)	311 (43)	0.001	 	Race/Ethnicity, n (%)	0.46	 	Non-Hispanic Black	887 (39)	612 (40)	275 (38)		 	Non-Hispanic White	164 (7)	104 (7)	60 (8)		 	Hispanic	882 (36)	561 (37)	261 (36)		 	Other /Unknown	393 (17)	260 (17)	133 (18)		 	Body mass index, kg/m2	28.6 (24.8-33.3)	28.9 (24.9-33.7)	28.2 (24.5-32.6)	0.026	 	Past medical diagnosis, n (%)	 	Hypertension	1980 (87)	1348 (88)	632 (87)	0.23	 	ASHD	820 (36)	496 (32)	324 (44)	&lt;0.001	 	Lung disease	761 (34)	504 (33)	257 (35)	0.58	 	Charlson comorbidity index	5 (3-9)	4 (2-8)	7 (4-10)	&lt;0.001	 	Days from symptoms to presentation	3 (0-6)	3 (0-7)	2 (0-5)	&lt;0.001	 	Vital signs at presentation	 	Systolic blood pressure, mm Hg	133 (116-151)	134 (118-151)	129 (107-150)	&lt;0.001	 	Diastolic blood pressure, mm Hg	74 (64-84)	75 (66-84)	71 (58-83)	&lt;0.001	 	Heart rate, beats/min	98 (85-112)	97 (85-110)	101 (86-117)	0.001	 	Oxygen saturation (%)	95 (90-98)	95 (92-98)	93 (86-97)	&lt;0.001	 	Respiratory rate, breaths/min	20 (18-23)	20 (18-22)	22 (18-26)	&lt;0.001	 	Temperature,  F	98.9 (98.2-100)	98.9 (98.2-100)	98.9 (98.1-100.3)	0.02	 	Laboratory markers	 	Alanine transaminase, U/L	25 (16-40)	25 (16-39)	26 (17-42)	0.050	 	Neutrophil count, k/muL	5.8 (4-8.4)	5.6 (3.8-7.9)	6.5 (4.6-9.9)	&lt;0.001	 	Lymphocyte count, k/muL	1 (0.7-1.3)	1 (0.7-1.4)	0.9 (0.6-1.3)	&lt;0.001	 	Ferritin, ng/mL	733 (757-1581)	701 (335-1452)	911 (504-2097)	&lt;0.001	 	Lactate dehydrogenase, U/L	401 (300-549)	372 (285-492)	506 (359-693)	&lt;0.001	 	C-reactive protein, mg/L	11.6 (5.1-20.1)	10 (4.4-18.2)	15.7 (8.6-24)	&lt;0.001	 	d-dimer, mug/mL	2 (1-4.5)	1.8 (0.9-3.6)	3 (1.5-8.5)	&lt;0.001	 	Procalcitonin, ng/mL	0.3 (0.1-1.1)	0.2 (0.1-0.7)	0.9 (0.3-3.4)	&lt;0.001	 	Lactic acid, mmole/L	2.2 (1.6-3.1)	2.1 (1.6-2.8)	2.6 (1.9-4)	&lt;0.001	 	ProBNP, pg/mL	581 (149-2857)	354 (104-1479)	1645 (547-8487)	&lt;0.001	 	Creatinine, mg/dL	1.3 (0.9-2.5)	1.2 (0.9-2.1)	1.8 (1.2-3.4)	&lt;0.001	 	Glucose, mg/dL	180 (120-274)	172 (124-266)	197 (138-304)	&lt;0.001	 	Troponin T, mg/mL	0.01 (0.01-0.05)	0.01 (0.01-0.03)	0.03 (0.01-0.1)	&lt;0.001	 	Inpatient medications, n (%)	 	ACE inhibitors	196 (8.7)	158 (10)	38 (5.2)	&lt;0.001	 	ARB	165 (7.4)	127 (8.3)	38 (5.2)	0.009	 	Hydroxycholoroquine	1652 (73)	1130 (74)	522 (72)	&lt;0.001	 	Antibiotics	1758 (78)	1096 (71)	662 (91)	&lt;0.001	 	Intravenous steroids	557 (25)	299 (20)	258 (35)	0.12	 	\nACE indicates angiotensin-converting enzyme; ARB, angiotensin receptor blocker; ASHD, atherosclerotic heart disease; BNP, B-type natriuretic peptide; and COVID-19, coronavirus disease 2019.\nSurvivors vs nonsurvivors.\nOther includes Asian, Pacific Islander, American Indian, Alaskan Native, or Other.\nDiabetes Mellitus and Statin Use\nAmong patients with diabetes mellitus, 983 (43%) received and 1283 (57%) did not receive a statin.

PS analyses with either caliper matching (average treatment effect on the treated: HR, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.83-0.94; P&lt;0.001) or IPTW (average treatment effect on the treated: HR, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.84-0.92; P&lt;0.001) showed a statistically significant 12% reduced risk of in-hospital mortality in patients with diabetes mellitus receiving statin therapy (Table 4).\nDiscussion\nIn this analysis involving a large cohort of hospitalized patients with COVID-19, statin use was associated with reduced in-hospital mortality in patients with diabetes mellitus. This observation was made despite older age and higher prevalence of hypertension and atherosclerotic heart disease in statin users with diabetes mellitus. Patients with diabetes mellitus either on or off statin therapy presented to the hospital in a similar time frame from the onset of symptoms; however, those on a statin had lower inflammatory markers. After matching and weighing confounding clinical covariables and indication, there remained an association between statin therapy and reduced in-hospital mortality.\nThere is a paucity of studies that have assessed the association between statin use and in-hospital mortality during COVID-19. An observational analysis from China reported an association between statin use and improved survival among hospitalized patients with COVID-19. 18  Unlike this study, our investigation focuses on a cohort of sicker hospitalized patients within the United States, which had notably greater overall in-hospital mortality. Moreover, in our cohort, we observed higher survival within patients with diabetes mellitus, who may carry mitigating characteristics for statin therapy.\nType 1 diabetes mellitus is as an autoimmune disease with destruction of pancreatic beta cells. During type 1 diabetes mellitus, there is persistent inflammation mediated through interferon gamma, tumor necrosis factor alpha, and interleukin-1 beta. 19  Type 2 diabetes mellitus is characterized by a chronic low-grade inflammatory state promoted by a variety of pathways including immune dysregulation, alterations in gut microorganisms, and metabolic syndrome. 20  Patients with diabetes mellitus can have an initial delay in the adaptive immune response to viral infection and may subsequently experience an exaggerated hyperinflammatory response to SARS-CoV-2 infection. 21  Indeed, mortality during COVID-19 is disproportionally elevated in patients with diabetes mellitus, who incur a 2- to 3-fold greater adjusted risk of death, 22 ,  23  and early studies have noted higher levels of interleukin-6 and C-reactive protein with COVID-19. 24  \nStatins are known to have anti-inflammatory effects that are clinically evident through a reduction in inflammatory biomarkers such as C-reactive protein, 5  and these effects are also apparent in patients with diabetes mellitus. 25  In our cohort, patients with diabetes mellitus in the statin group presented with lower inflammatory markers and had reduced mortality. In contrast, there was no difference in inflammatory markers at presentation in patients without diabetes mellitus either on or off statins (Table 3). Presuming that in-hospital statin administration was indicative of outpatient usage and adherence, one might speculate that statin therapy blunted the COVID-19 inflammatory response before admission as well as during hospitalization, and improved survival was related to ongoing chronic statin use. This hypothesis would have to be prospectively tested. Guidelines recommend statin therapy for adults 40 to 75 years of age with diabetes mellitus to reduce cardiovascular disease, 26  but these agents remain underused. 27  Usage of statins in patients with diabetes mellitus is reported to be low, in the 40% to 50% range, with further underusage in minorities, 27  which was consistent within our cohort. Our findings, if validated, may further strengthen and refocus administration of statins to patients with diabetes mellitus during the COVID-19 era.\nLimitations\nThis investigation has several limitations. First, given the retrospective nature of our investigation and admission of patients not necessarily followed chronically at our institution, we were unable to firmly differentiate patients who received a statin into subcategories of prehospital user or in-hospital user and those with cessation of chronic statin use. However, it has not been our institutional practice to initiate new statin therapy in patients with acute COVID-19 illness. In addition, typical clinical parameters that might lead to discontinuation of statin therapy, such as a significant elevation in liver enzymes including alanine aminotransferase, was neither apparent nor clinically meaningfully different between those who did and did not receive statins. Patients on statins may have unmeasured confounders that could not be assessed through matching and weighting methods. However, such unmeasured confounders would also be present in statin users without diabetes mellitus, who did not show any difference in hospital mortality in comparison to nonusers. The fidelity of the data may be limited by the accuracy and level of documentation within the electronic medical records. Because of the single-center design, generalizability may be limited. These observational findings do not assess the efficacy of statins as a therapeutic agent for COVID-19 in patients with diabetes mellitus, which can be accomplished only through a randomized control trial.\nConclusions\nIn summary, in this observational analysis, statin administration to patients with diabetes mellitus was associated with a reduced risk of in-hospital mortality during COVID-19. Further study to validate our findings and investigate underlying mechanisms is needed.\nSources of Funding\nDr Saeed is supported by grants from the National Institutes for Health/National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (K23HL145140) and the National Center for Advancing Translational Science Clinical and Translational Science Award at Einstein-Montefiore (UL1TR001073).

We described characteristics of the cases and estimated the key epidemiologic time-delay distributions.\n\n In the early period of exponential growth, we estimated the epidemic doubling time and the basic reproductive number.\n\n\nResults\nAmong the first 425 patients with confirmed NCIP, the median age was 59 years and 56% were male.\n\n The majority of cases (55%) with onset before January 1, 2020, were linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, as compared with 8.6% of the subsequent cases.\n\n The mean incubation period was 5.2 days (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.1 to 7.0), with the 95th percentile of the distribution at 12.5 days.\n\n In its early stages, the epidemic doubled in size every 7.4 days.\n\n With a mean serial interval of 7.5 days (95% CI, 5.3 to 19), the basic reproductive number was estimated to be 2.2 (95% CI, 1.4 to 3.9).\n\n\nConclusions\nOn the basis of this information, there is evidence that human-to-human transmission has occurred among close contacts since the middle of December 2019. Considerable efforts to reduce transmission will be required to control outbreaks if similar dynamics apply elsewhere.\n\n Measures to prevent or reduce transmission should be implemented in populations at risk.\n\n (Funded by the Ministry of Science and Technology of China and others.\n\n)\n","id":"PMC7121484","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Massachusetts Medical

SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia in Wuhan, China: a single-centered, retrospective, observational study","abstract":"Background\nAn ongoing outbreak of pneumonia associated with the severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) started in December, 2019, in Wuhan, China.\n\n Information about critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection is scarce.\n\n We aimed to describe the clinical course and outcomes of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this single-centered, retrospective, observational study, we enrolled 52 critically ill adult patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia who were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) of Wuhan Jin Yin-tan hospital (Wuhan, China) between late December, 2019, and Jan 26, 2020. Demographic data, symptoms, laboratory values, comorbidities, treatments, and clinical outcomes were all collected.\n\n Data were compared between survivors and non-survivors.\n\n The primary outcome was 28-day mortality, as of Feb 9, 2020. Secondary outcomes included incidence of SARS-CoV-2-related acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and the proportion of patients requiring mechanical ventilation.\n\n\nFindings\nOf 710 patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, 52 critically ill adult patients were included.\n\n The mean age of the 52 patients was 59·7 (SD 13·3) years, 35 (67%) were men, 21 (40%) had chronic illness, 51 (98%) had fever.\n\n 32 (61·5%) patients had died at 28 days, and the median duration from admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) to death was 7 (IQR 3–11) days for non-survivors.\n\n Compared with survivors, non-survivors were older (64·6 years [11·2] vs 51·9 years [12·9]), more likely to develop ARDS (26 [81%] patients vs 9 [45%] patients), and more likely to receive mechanical ventilation (30 [94%] patients vs 7 [35%] patients), either invasively or non-invasively.\n\n Most patients had organ function damage, including 35 (67%) with ARDS, 15 (29%) with acute kidney injury, 12 (23%) with cardiac injury, 15 (29%) with liver dysfunction, and one (2%) with pneumothorax.\n\n 37 (71%) patients required mechanical ventilation.\n\n Hospital-acquired infection occurred in seven (13·5%) patients.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe mortality of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia is considerable.\n\n The survival time of the non-survivors is likely to be within 1–2 weeks after ICU admission.\n\n Older patients (&gt;65 years) with comorbidities and ARDS are at increased risk of death.\n\n The severity of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia poses great strain on critical care resources in hospitals, especially if they are not adequately staffed or resourced.\n\n\nFunding\nNone.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7102538","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Elsevier

injury.\n However, it is not clear whether upregulation of the ACE2/Ang–(1–7)/Mas axis prevents LPS–induced injury in pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells (PMVECs) by inhibiting the MAPKs/NF–?B pathways.\n Primary cultured rat PMVECs were transduced with lentiviral–borne Ace2 or shRNA–Ace2, and then treated or not with Mas receptor blocker (A779) before exposure to LPS.\n LPS stimulation resulted in the higher levels of AngII, Ang–(1–7), cytokine secretion, and apoptosis rates, and the lower ACE2/ACE ratio.\n Ace2 reversed the ACE2/ACE imbalance and increased Ang–(1–7) levels, thus reducing LPS–induced apoptosis and inflammation, while inhibition of Ace2 reversed all these effects.\n A779 abolished these protective effects of Ace2.\n LPS treatment was associated with activation of the ERK, p38, JNK, and NF–?B pathways, which were aggravated by A779.

Caliper matching on the propensity score and a method based on earlier work by Cole and Hernán tended to have the best performance for estimating absolute effects of treatment on survival outcomes.\n

We found that many authors provided an unclear or incorrect interpretation of the regression coefficients associated with this model.\n An incorrect and inconsistent interpretation of regression coefficients may lead to confusion when comparing results across different studies.\n Furthermore, an incorrect interpretation of estimated regression coefficients can result in an incorrect

estimated treatment effects to the entire population of treated subjects.\n We describe an analytic solution to address the bias due to incomplete matching.\n Our method is based on using optimal or

using the propensity score is then employed to impute missing potential outcomes under lack of treatment for each treated subject.\n Using Monte Carlo simulations, we found that the proposed method

causal effects of treatments using observational data.\n Propensity-score matching methods are frequently used to adjust for differences in observed characteristics between treated and control individuals in observational studies.\n Survival or time-to-event outcomes occur frequently in the medical literature, but the use of propensity score methods in survival analysis has not been thoroughly investigated.\n This paper compares two approaches for estimating the Average Treatment Effect (ATE) on survival outcomes: Inverse Probability of Treatment Weighting (IPTW) and full matching.\n The performance of these methods was compared in an extensive set of simulations that varied the extent of confounding and the amount of misspecification of the propensity score model.\n We found that both IPTW and full matching resulted in estimation of marginal hazard ratios with negligible bias when the ATE was the target estimand and the treatment-selection process was weak to moderate.\n However, when the treatment-selection process was strong, both methods resulted in biased estimation of the true marginal hazard ratio, even when the propensity score model was correctly specified.\n When the propensity score model was correctly specified, bias tended to be lower for full matching than for IPTW.\n The reasons for these biases and for the differences between the two methods appeared to be due to some extreme weights generated for each method.\n Both methods tended to produce more extreme weights as the magnitude of the effects of covariates on treatment selection increased.\n Furthermore, more extreme weights were observed for IPTW than for full matching.\n However, the poorer performance of both methods in the presence of a strong treatment-selection process was mitigated by the use of IPTW with restriction and full matching with a caliper restriction when the propensity score model was correctly specified.\n","id":"PMC5564952","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"SAGE Publications","authors":[{"firstname":"Peter

of full matching when estimating effects on binary outcomes.\n This paper describes methods that can be used for estimating the effect of treatment on binary outcomes when using full matching.\n It then used Monte Carlo simulations to evaluate the performance of these methods based on full matching (with and without a caliper), and compared their performance with that of nearest neighbour

Clinical Outcomes of COVID-19 Infection Among Nursing Home Residents","abstract":"Objectives\nAngiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi), angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs), and HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (“statins”) have been hypothesized to affect COVID-19 severity.\n\n However, up to now, no studies investigating this association have been conducted in the most vulnerable and affected population groups (ie, older adults residing in nursing homes).\n\n The objective of this study was to explore the association of ACEi/ARB and/or statins with clinical manifestations in COVID-19–infected older adults residing in nursing homes.\n\n\nDesign\nWe undertook a retrospective multicenter cohort study to analyze the association between ACEi/ARB and/or statin use with clinical outcome of COVID-19. The outcomes were (1) serious COVID-19 defined as long-stay hospital admission or death within 14 days of disease onset, and (2) asymptomatic (ie, no disease symptoms in the whole study period while still being diagnosed by polymerase chain reaction).\n\n\nSetting and participants\nA total of 154 COVID-19–positive subjects were identified, residing in 1 of 2 Belgian nursing homes that experienced similar COVID-19 outbreaks.\n\n\nMeasures\nLogistic regression models were applied with age, sex, functional status, diabetes, and hypertension as covariates.\n\n\nResults\nWe found a statistically significant association between statin intake and the absence of symptoms during COVID-19 (odds ratio [OR] 2.91; confidence interval [CI] 1.27–6.71), which remained statistically significant after adjusting for covariates (OR 2.65; CI 1.13–6.68).\n\n Although the effects of statin intake on serious clinical outcome were in the same beneficial direction, these were not statistically significant (OR 0.75; CI 0.24–1.87).\n\n There was also no statistically significant association between ACEi/ARB and asymptomatic status (OR 2.72; CI 0.59–25.1) or serious clinical outcome (OR 0.48; CI 0.10–1.97).\n\n\nConclusions and Implications\nOur data indicate that statin intake in older, frail adults could be associated with a considerable beneficial effect on COVID-19 clinical symptoms.\n\n The role of statins and renin-angiotensin system drugs needs to be further explored in larger observational studies as well as randomized clinical trials.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7294267","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"AMDA - The Society for Post-Acute and Long-Term Care Medicine.","authors":[{"firstname":"Anton","surname":"De

significance, we conducted a multicenter retrospective cohort study that included 5,771 adult patients with COVID?19 pneumonia in Hubei Province.\n\n\nApproach and Results\nWe reported the distributional and temporal patterns of liver injury indicators in these patients and determined their associated factors and death risk.\n\n Longitudinal liver function tests were retrospectively analyzed and correlated with the risk factors and death.\n\n Liver injury dynamic patterns differed in alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and total bilirubin (TBIL).\n\n AST elevated first, followed by ALT, in severe patients.\n\n ALP modestly increased during hospitalization and largely remained in the normal range.\n\n The fluctuation in TBIL levels was mild in the non?severe and the severe groups.\n\n AST abnormality was associated with the highest mortality risk compared with the other indicators of liver injury during hospitalization.\n\n Common factors associated with elevated liver injury indicators were lymphocyte count decrease, neutrophil count increase, and male gender.\n\n\nConclusion\nThe dynamic patterns of liver injury indicators and their potential risk factors may provide an important explanation for the COVID?19?associated liver injury.\n\n Because elevated liver injury indicators, particularly AST, are strongly associated with the mortality risk, our study indicates that these parameters should be monitored during hospitalization.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7267515","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"John Wiley and Sons

combinatorial, multiparameter analysis of autoantibodies and autoreactive T-cell responses in 33 children/adolescents with newly diagnosed diabetes.\n Multidimensional cluster analysis showed two equal-sized patient agglomerations characterized by proinflammatory (interferon-?–positive, multiautoantibody-positive) and partially regulated (interleukin-10–positive, pauci-autoantibody–positive) responses.\n Multiautoantibody-positive nondiabetic siblings at high risk of disease progression showed similar clustering.\n Additionally, pancreas samples obtained post mortem from a separate cohort of 21 children/adolescents with recently diagnosed type 1 diabetes were examined immunohistologically.\n This revealed two distinct types of insulitic lesions distinguishable by the degree of cellular infiltrate and presence of B cells that we termed “hyper-immune CD20Hi” and “pauci-immune CD20Lo.\n” Of note, subjects had only one infiltration phenotype and were partitioned by this into two equal-sized groups that differed significantly by age at diagnosis, with hyper-immune CD20Hi subjects being 5 years younger.\n These data indicate potentially related islet and blood autoimmune response phenotypes that coincide with and precede disease.\n We conclude that different immunopathological processes (endotypes) may underlie type 1 diabetes, carrying important implications for

type 1 diabetes has not been defined.\n\n To address the relevance of such cells, we examined IL-17 secretion in response to ?-cell autoantigens, IL-17A gene expression in islets, and the potential functional consequences of IL-17 release for ?-cells.\n\n\nRESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS\nPeripheral blood CD4 T-cell responses to ?-cell autoantigens (proinsulin, insulinoma-associated protein, and GAD65 peptides) were measured by IL-17 enzyme-linked immunospot assay in patients with new-onset type 1 diabetes (n = 50).\n\n mRNA expression of IL-17A and IFNG pathway genes was studied by qRT-PCR using islets obtained from subjects who died 5 days and 10 years after diagnosis of disease, respectively, and from matched control subjects.\n\n IL-17 effects on the function of human islets, rat ?-cells, and the rat insulinoma cell line INS-1E were examined.\n\n\nRESULTS\nA total of 27 patients (54%) showed IL-17 reactivity to one or more ?-cell peptides versus 3 of 30 (10%) control subjects (P = 0.0001).\n\n In a single case examined close to diagnosis, islet expression of IL17A, RORC, and IL22 was detected.\n\n It is noteworthy that we show that IL-17 mediates significant and

upregulation of ?-cell IL17RA expression via activation of the transcription factors STAT1 and nuclear factor (NF)-?B.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nCirculating IL-17+ ?-cell–specific autoreactive CD4 T-cells are a feature of type 1 diabetes diagnosis.\n\n We disclose a novel pathway to ?-cell death involving IL-17 and STAT1 and NF-?B, rendering this cytokine a novel disease biomarker and potential therapeutic

fat?","abstract":"Background\nAlthough obesity and diabetes commonly co-exist, the evidence base to support obesity as the major driver of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), and the mechanisms by which this occurs, are now better appreciated.\n\n\nDiscussion\nThis review briefly examines several sources of evidence – epidemiological, genetic, molecular, and clinical trial – to support obesity being a causal risk factor for T2DM.\n\n It also summarises the ectopic fat hypothesis for this condition, and lists several pieces of evidence to support this concept, extending from rare conditions and drug effects to sex- and ethnicity-related differences in T2DM prevalence.\n\n Ectopic liver fat is the best-studied example of ectopic fat, but more research on pancreatic fat as a potential cause of ?-cell dysfunction seems warranted.\n\n This ectopic fat concept, in turn, broadly fits with the observation that individuals of similar ages can develop diabetes at markedly different body mass indexes (BMIs).\n\n Those with risk factors leading to more rapid ectopic fat gain – for example, men (compared with women), certain ethnicities, and potentially those with a family history of diabetes, as well as others with genes linked to a reduced subcutaneous adiposity – are more likely to develop diabetes at a younger age and/or lower BMI than those without.\n\n\nSummary\nObesity is the major risk factor for T2DM and appears to drive tissue insulin resistance in part via gain of ectopic fat, with the best-studied organ being the liver.\n\n However, ectopic fat in the pancreas may contribute to ?-cell dysfunction.\n\n In line with this observation, rapid resolution of diabetes linked to a preferential and rapid reduction in liver fat has been noted with significant caloric reduction.\n\n Whether these observations can help develop better cost-effective and sustainable lifestyle /medical interventions in patients with T2DM requires further study.\n\n\n","id":"PMC4143560","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"BioMed

behavior, diet, and lifestyle during the last decades are considered the major causes.\n\n A Western diet, which is rich in saturated fat and simple sugars, may lead to changes in gut microbial composition and physiology, which have recently been linked to the development of metabolic diseases.\n\n\nMethods\nWe will discuss evidence that demonstrates the influence of the small and large intestinal microbiota on weight regulation and the development of insulin resistance, based on literature search.\n\n\nResults\nAltered large intestinal microbial composition may promote obesity by increasing energy harvest through specialized gut microbes.\n\n In both large and small intestine, microbial alterations may increase gut permeability that facilitates the translocation of whole bacteria or endotoxic bacterial components into metabolic active tissues.\n\n Moreover, changed microbial communities may affect the production of satiety-inducing signals.\n\n Finally, bacterial metabolic products, such as short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) and their relative ratios, may be causal in disturbed immune and metabolic signaling, notably in the small intestine where the surface is large.\n\n The function of these organs (adipose tissue, brain, liver, muscle, pancreas) may be disturbed by the induction of low-grade inflammation, contributing to insulin resistance.\n\n\nConclusions\nInterventions aimed to restoring gut microbial homeostasis, such as ingestion of specific fibers or therapeutic microbes, are promising strategies to reduce insulin

gut microbiota is essential for human health and plays an important role in the pathogenesis of several diseases.\n Short-chain fatty acids (SCFA), such as acetate, butyrate and propionate, are end-products of microbial fermentation of macronutrients that distribute systemically via the blood.\n The aim of this study was to investigate the transcriptional response of immature and LPS-matured human monocyte-derived DC to SCFA.\n Our data revealed distinct effects exerted by each individual SCFA on gene expression in human monocyte-derived DC, especially in the mature ones.\n Acetate only exerted negligible effects, while both butyrate and propionate strongly modulated gene expression in both immature and mature human monocyte-derived DC.\n An Ingenuity pathway analysis based on the differentially expressed genes suggested that propionate and butyrate modulate leukocyte trafficking, as SCFA strongly reduced the release of several pro-inflammatory chemokines including CCL3, CCL4, CCL5, CXCL9, CXCL10, and CXCL11. Additionally, butyrate and propionate inhibited the expression of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced cytokines such as IL-6 and IL-12p40 showing a strong anti-inflammatory effect.\n This work illustrates that bacterial metabolites far from the site of their production can differentially modulate the inflammatory response and generally provides new insights into host-microbiome

potentiate the generation of anti-inflammatory Treg or pro-inflammatory Th17 cells2-6, the molecular cues driving this process remain elusive.\n Considering the vital metabolic function afforded by

short-chain fatty acid (SCFA), butyrate, produced by commensal microorganisms during starch fermentation, facilitated extrathymic generation of Treg cells.\n A boost in Treg cell numbers upon provision of butyrate was due to potentiation of extrathymic differentiation of Treg cells as the observed phenomenon was dependent upon intronic enhancer CNS1, essential for extrathymic, but dispensable for thymic Treg cell differentiation1, 7.\n In addition to butyrate, de novo Treg cell generation in the periphery was potentiated by propionate, another SCFA of microbial origin capable

with reduced volume densities of ?-cell and ?-cell, and increased body mass index (BMI), but not with duration of diabetes, age or HbA1c.\n\n Amyloid-rich islets contained an increased number of macrophages mixed with ?-cells with oxidative stress-related DNA damage, characterized by ?H2AX expression, and suppressed (pro)insulin mRNA expression.\n\n\nConclusions\nIn Japanese type 2 diabetic patients, islet amyloid was more common with severe ?-cell loss and high BMI, associated with macrophage infiltration.\n\n\n","id":"PMC4196506","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Informa

and biological activity of gevokizumab in patients with type 2 diabetes.\n\n\nRESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS\nIn a placebo-controlled, dose-escalation study, a total of 98 patients were randomly assigned to placebo (17 subjects) or gevokizumab (81 subjects) at increasing doses and dosing schedules.\n\n The primary objective of the study was to evaluate the safety profile of gevokizumab in type 2 diabetes.\n\n The secondary objectives were to assess pharmacokinetics for different dose levels, routes of administration, and regimens and to assess biological activity.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe study drug

the progressive decline in ?-cell function.\n\n In this study, we longitudinally evaluated the effect of islet autoimmune development on the progressive ?-cell dysfunction in T2D patients.\n\n\nRESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS\nTwenty-three T2D patients negative for islet autoantibodies (GAD antibody and insulinoma-associated protein 2) and islet-specific T cells were evaluated prospectively for up to 36 months.\n\n We investigated the percentage of patients who developed islet autoantibodies (Ab+) and/or islet-reactive T cells (T+) and the effect of the islet autoimmunity on fasting and glucagon-stimulated C-peptide responses.\n\n We defined positive islet autoimmunity as Ab+ and/or T+ for at least two study visits.\n\n\nRESULTS\nOf the 23 patients, 6 (26%) remained negative for islet autoimmunity (Ab?T?), 14 (61%) developed Ab+ and/or T+, and 3 (13%) were unclassifiable because they developed islet autoimmunity at only one study visit.\n\n Islet Ab+ was observed to be less stable than islet-specific T-cell responses.\n\n Development of islet autoimmunity was significantly associated with a more rapid decline in fasting (P &lt; 0.0001) and glucagon-stimulated

first study (West of Scotland Coronary Prevention Study [WOSCOPS]) that evaluated this association reported a small protective effect but used nonstandardized criteria for diabetes diagnosis.\n\n However, results from subsequent hypothesis-testing trials have been inconsistent.\n\n The aim of this meta-analysis is to evaluate the possible effect of statin therapy on incident diabetes.\n\n\nRESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS\nA systematic literature search for randomized statin trials that reported data on diabetes through February 2009 was conducted using specific search terms.\n\n In addition to the hypothesis-generating data from WOSCOPS, hypothesis-testing data were available from the Heart Protection Study (HPS), the Long-Term Intervention with Pravastatin in Ischemic Disease (LIPID) Study, the Anglo-Scandinavian Cardiac Outcomes Trial (ASCOT), the Justification for the Use of Statins in Prevention: an Intervention Trial Evaluating Rosuvastatin (JUPITER), and the Controlled Rosuvastatin Multinational Study in Heart Failure (CORONA), together including 57,593 patients with mean follow-up of 3.9 years during which 2,082 incident diabetes cases accrued.\n\n Weighted averages were reported as risk ratios (RRs) with 95% CIs using a random-effects model.\n\n Statistical heterogeneity scores were assessed with the Q and I2 statistic.\n\n\nRESULTS\nIn the meta-analysis of the hypothesis-testing trials, we observed a small increase in diabetes risk (RR 1.13 [95% CI 1.03–1.23]) with no evidence of heterogeneity across trials.\n\n However, this estimate was attenuated and no longer significant when the hypothesis-generating trial WOSCOPS was included (1.06 [0.93–1.25]) and also resulted in significant heterogeneity

Demographic data, symptoms, laboratory values, comorbidities, treatments, and clinical outcomes were all collected.\n\n Data were compared between survivors and non-survivors.\n\n The primary outcome was 28-day mortality, as of Feb 9, 2020. Secondary outcomes included incidence of SARS-CoV-2-related acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and the proportion of patients requiring mechanical ventilation.\n\n\nFindings\nOf 710 patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, 52 critically ill adult patients were included.\n\n The mean age of the 52 patients was 59·7 (SD 13·3) years, 35 (67%) were men, 21 (40%) had chronic illness, 51 (98%) had

COVID-19-induced pneumonia met the inclusion criteria and were included in this study.\n\n Efficacy evaluation at 2 weeks after hospitalization indicated that 11 patients (14.1%) had deteriorated, and 67 patients (85.9%) had improved/stabilized.\n\n The patients in the progression group were significantly older than those in the disease improvement/stabilization group (66 [51, 70] vs.\n\n 37 [32, 41] years, U?=?4.932, P?=?0.001).\n\n The progression group had a significantly higher proportion of patients with a history of smoking than the improvement/stabilization group (27.3% vs.\n\n 3.0%, ?2?=?9.291, P?=?0.018).\n\n For all the 78 patients, fever was the most common initial symptom, and the maximum body temperature at admission was significantly higher in the progression group than in the improvement/stabilization group (38.2 [37.8, 38.6] vs.\n\n 37.5 [37.0, 38.4]°C, U?=?2.057, P?=?0.027).\n\n Moreover, the proportion of patients with respiratory failure (54.5% vs.\n\n 20.9%, ?2?=?5.611, P?=?0.028) and respiratory rate (34 [18, 48] vs.\n\n 24 [16, 60] breaths/min, U?=?4.030, P?=?0.004) were significantly higher in the progression group than in the improvement/stabilization group.\n\n C-reactive protein was significantly elevated in the progression group compared to the improvement/stabilization group (38.9 [14.3, 64.8] vs.\n\n 10.6 [1.9, 33.1] mg/L, U?=?1.315, P?=?0.024).\n\n Albumin was significantly lower in the progression group than in the improvement/stabilization group (36.62?±?6.60 vs.\n\n 41.27?±?4.55?g/L, U?=?2.843, P?=?0.006).\n\n Patients in the progression group were more likely to receive high-level respiratory support than in the improvement/stabilization group (?2?=?16.01, P?=?0.001).\n\n Multivariate logistic analysis indicated that age (odds ratio [OR], 8.546; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.628–44.864; P?=?0.011), history of smoking (OR, 14.285; 95% CI: 1.577–25.000; P?=?0.018), maximum body temperature at admission (OR, 8.999; 95% CI: 1.036–78.147, P?=?0.046), respiratory failure (OR, 8.772, 95% CI: 1.942–40.000; P?=?0.016), albumin (OR, 7.353, 95% CI: 1.098–50.000; P?=?0.003), and C-reactive protein (OR, 10.530; 95% CI: 1.224?34.701, P?=?0.028) were risk factors for disease progression.\n\n\nConclusions\nSeveral factors that led to the progression of COVID-19 pneumonia were identified, including age, history of smoking, maximum body temperature at admission, respiratory failure, albumin, and C-reactive protein.\n\n These results can be used to further enhance the ability of management of COVID-19 pneumonia.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7147279","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Wolters Kluwer
