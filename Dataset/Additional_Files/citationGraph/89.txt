Introduction\nThe Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change predicts that climate change is likely to cause an increase in flood hazards in many areas of the world. Floods are the most frequent natural disasters in Canada, occurring almost five times as often as the next most common disaster, wildfire. There is also a strong consensus on the increase in the intensity and frequency of precipitation in the province of Quebec, Canada which is likely to cause more flooding in the coming decades.\nFloods represent a serious threat to human health beyond the immediate risk of drowning. They can increase exposure to toxins and pathogens may have implications for mental health, and can disrupt the capacity of health care systems to respond to health crises. These environmental disasters are also known to be associated with intense stress and the individuals involved in such events are often forced to make unusual efforts. However, there is little data on the potential link between floods and direct consequences on health, such as cardiovascular diseases (CVD). In fact, a few studies have reported an association between natural disasters on the increased occurrence of CVD, such as after the tsunami in Japan in 2011. This study reports a significant increase in acute heart failure in the tsunami area when compared to the predisaster period. The maximal peak was observed three to four weeks after the event. Since CVD is the second most important causes of death in Canada, a better understanding of the impact of these weather disasters on cardiovascular health will allow us to improve the surveillance and the prevention of these diseases as well as providing empirical data to elaborate strategic action plans on patient care and health services. Furthermore, climate change increases the need for research, both for the assessment of future health burdens and improving analysis of current and future options for health-related response.\nSpring snowmelt accompanied by rainfall is the major cause of flooding in the province of Quebec, Canada. This was the case of the flood in the city of Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu in 2011 (located near Montreal, Figure 1A). It was the longest and one of the worst floods in the recent history of Quebec. From 22 April to 14 June 2011, the rapid snowmelt conjugated with torrential rain falls that lasted for several weeks, led to increasing water levels of Lake Champlain and the Richelieu River to critical thresholds never registered before, causing a major overflow in Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu. It took nearly four months until the complete resorption of the water in the city. During this period, residents of 1619 homes were evacuated and overall, 2663 homes were flooded to various extents. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of this flood on the occurrence of acute CVD. This study was part of a ministerial program aimed at a better understanding of the association between cardiovascular diseases and climate change in Quebec.\n2. Methods\n2.1. Design\nTo measure the relationship between the flood in Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu in spring 2011 and the occurrence of acute CVD, a population-based retrospective cohort study was conducted using a time series design with multiple control groups.\nDefining the Study Areas Using a Geographic Information System (GIS) Approach\nA GIS approach was used to define the flooded area (area 1) and two control areas in the same town (areas 2 and 3) according to the postal codes (Figure 1B). The flooded population and the non-flooded population were separated by a defined buffer zone of 200 meters to insure the absence of flooded postal codes in the control area (Figure 1B). A town nearby Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu (Granby, Figure 1A) with a similar population size, a comparable socioeconomic status and the presence of a river not affected by the flood in spring 2011, was also selected as a control population (area 4).\n(A) Map of the province of Quebec in Canada, as well as the cities of Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu and Granby; (B) Map of the studied areas in Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu (1: Flooded area; 2 and 3: Control areas; BZ: Buffer zone (200 meters)).\nGIS technology has become a powerful tool to map the extent of such events and investigate public health issues. The GIS component of the study was addressed using data on water levels of the Richelieu River and topographic elevation maps. Water levels were obtained from the hydraulic records of the Government of Canada who maintains a hydraulic measuring station in Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu (station 02OJ016) (Figure 2A). Data were available through the National Water Data Archive (HYDAT database), which provides information on the water flow, daily values on water levels in real time and archived since 1972. Topographic maps were obtained from the airborne remote sensing LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) technology that provides very accurate maps of the area. Data on water levels were paired to the high resolution topographic LiDAR maps for the year of 2011, using Arc Hydro tools in the ArcGIS software (version 10.2) (Environmental Systems Research Institute Inc.: California, CA, USA) (Figure 2B). The number and extent of postal codes affected by the flood were extracted to identify the study cohorts (presented in Figure 1B). The flooded population (area 1) consists of 271 postal codes flooded to various extents, 119 of which had more than half of their surface area flooded. The control area 2 near the river was delimited by a 500-meters wide zone and included 1003 postal codes while the control area 3 included 1314 postal codes. These control areas were defined as such in order to provide a balanced coverage of the area.\nGeographic Information System (GIS) approach: defining the study areas.

Health Data Sources\nThis study used medico-administrative data extracted from the Quebec Integrated Chronic Disease Surveillance System (QICDSS) created by the Institute National de Sante Publique du Quebec (INSPQ). The QICDSS is an innovative chronic disease surveillance system developed in order to monitor several chronic diseases in Quebec, such as cardiovascular diseases. The QICDSS data are derived from the linkage of five health administrative databases administered by the provincial health insurance board (Regie de l'Assurance Maladie du Quebec (RAMQ)). The QICDSS contains information on all individuals covered by the Quebec universal public health insurance plan that had or are at risk of at least one of the studied chronic diseases. The five data sources are the health insurance registry, the hospitalization database, the physician claims database (including emergency department (ED) visits, outpatient visits and community physicians' visits), the pharmaceutical services database (for people aged 65 years and older), and the vital statistics death database. The health insurance registry contains information on patient demography (age, gender), geographic localization, as well as the eligibility to the province's public health and drug insurance plans. The hospitalization database provides information on inpatient discharges from Quebec hospitals. The data are related to the hospital stay (e.g., date, location, and duration), diagnoses (e.g., primary and secondary diagnoses), services, intensive care and interventions. Diagnostic codes are based on the international statistical classification of diseases and related health problems, 9th Revision (ICD-9) up to 31 March 2006, and the Canadian enhancement of the 10th Revision (ICD-10-CA) thereafter. The physician claims database provides data related to fee-for-service billing. These include the diagnosis code associated with the service rendered (ICD-9 coding system), the treating physician and the location where the service was provided. Using a unique encrypted identifier, patient data with specific selected chronic diseases from all these databases were merged to create the QICDSS.\n2.3. Study Population\nThe adult populations (&gt;=20 years old) of the different study areas were identified according to the postal code of their residence in the QICDSS database. To be part of the cohorts, subjects had to be covered by the Quebec public health insurance plan at least one day in the fiscal year in which acute CVD is assessed. About 99% of the adult population in Quebec is covered by the public health insurance plan.\n2.4. Cardiovascular Outcomes\nAn acute cardiovascular event was defined as a diagnosis of a major or a potentially fatal CVD associated with an ED visit or with a hospitalization (main cause and urgent). All diagnoses were identified using the ICD-9 and ICD-10-CA codes. Precisely, CVD assessed were coronary diseases (ICD-9 codes: 410-414 and ICD-10-CA codes: I20-I24) and heart failure (ICD-9 code: 428 and ICD-10-CA code: I50).\nThe occurrence of acute CVD was compared between the flooded population of area 1 and the non-flooded populations of areas 2, 3 and 4 during a 4-month period, from 1 April 2011, to 31 July 2011 (spring 2011). The occurrence of acute CVD was also compared at three different periods in time in the affected area (area 1). Thereby, the period corresponding to the flood (spring 2011) was compared to the same 4-month period of spring 2010 (1 April 2010, to 31 July 2010) and of spring 2012 (1 April 2012, to 31 July 2012).\n2.5. Confounders\nAge, gender, Charlson comorbidity index (adapted for the Quebec health administrative databases by D'Hoore et al.), history of CVD, most common risk factors for CVD (hypertension and diabetes) and mental health disorders were included as potential confounders of the association between the flood and the occurrence of acute cardiovascular events. Since the history of CVD and diabetes were included as separated cofounders, these conditions were excluded from the Charlson Comorbidity index calculation. History of CVD was defined as a hospitalization with a main or a secondary diagnosis of CVD (ICD-9 codes: 410-414, 428, 362.3, 430-432, 434-436 and ICD-10-CA codes: I20-I25, I50, G45 (excluding G45.4), H34.0, H34.1, I60, I61, I63 ((excluding I63.6), I64) or a coronary intervention (The Canadian Classification of Diagnostic, Therapeutic and Surgical Procedures (CCP) codes: 48.02, 48.03, 48.11-48.19 and The Canadian Classification of Health Interventions (CCI) codes: 1.IJ.50, 1.IJ.57.GQ, 1.IJ.54, 1.IJ.76) or at least two ambulatory visits for CVD in a one-year span between 1996 and the beginning of the study period. History of hypertension was defined as a hospitalization with a main or a secondary diagnosis of hypertension (ICD-9 codes: 401-405 and ICD-10-CA codes: I10-I13, I15) or at least two ambulatory visits for hypertension in a two-year span between 1996 and the beginning of the study period. History of diabetes had the same definition as hypertension with their corresponding ICD-9 and ICD-10-CA codes: 250 and E10-E14, respectively. Finally, history of mental disorders was defined as a hospitalization with a main or a secondary diagnosis of mental disorders (ICD-9 codes: 290-319 and ICD-10-CA codes: F00-F99) or at least one ambulatory visits for a mental disorder in the year before the beginning of the study period.\n2.6. Statistical Analysis\nChi-square tests were conducted to examine differences in the occurrence of acute cardiovascular events according to the area (area 1 vs. areas 2, 3 or 4), and the period (spring 2011 vs. spring 2010 or 2012). A multivariate logistic regression with repeated measures using generalized estimating equations (GEE) was done to compare the risk of acute cardiovascular events between the flooded population (area 1) in spring 2011 and the population in the same area in spring 2010 and in spring 2012. This analysis was repeated in the sub-population who had a history of CVD in order to measure the impact of the flood within this most vulnerable population. In these cases, a GEE method is used in place of basic regression approaches because the population in the same area was evaluated over time and the study variables were correlated, thus violating independence assumptions made by traditional regression procedures. To compare the risk of acute cardiovascular events between the flooded population (area 1) and the control populations (areas 2, 3 and 4) during the period corresponding to the flood (spring 2011), a traditional multivariate logistic regression was applied. Models were adjusted for the cofounders mentioned above and adjusted odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were presented. All analyses were performed using SAS 9.2 Statistical Software (SAS Institute Inc.: Cary, NC). All p-values were two-sided, and p-values of  0.05 were considered to be statistically significant. \n2.7. Ethical Aspects\nThe processes of creating the QICDSS and data access both meet stringent standards of security and privacy. Government bodies in legal possession of the databases, the public health ethics committee and the Commission d'acces a l'information du Quebec evaluated and approved the creation process and the surveillance that can be done with this system. The study was conducted according to an agreement established between the INSPQ and the government of Quebec in part of the ministerial plan of multithematic surveillance. This plan has received its approval by the Public Health Ethic Committee in January 2010 (ISBN: 978-2-550-58576-3).\n3. Results\nIn spring 2011, 10,081 adults covered by the public health insurance plan had their primary residence in the flooded area of Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu. Patient characteristics of the different study areas are presented in Table 1. When compared with the control populations (areas 2, 3, and 4), male/female ratio is slightly higher in the flooded population. There are also lower proportions of individuals with a high comorbidity index (&gt;=2), as well as with medical history of mental disorders, hypertension, diabetes and CVD within this population when compared to control populations of areas 2 and 4. However, these characteristics seem similar between the flooded population and the control population of area 3 (one of the control areas located in Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu). Baseline characteristics of individuals in the flooded area were relatively stable throughout the years of 2010 to 2012 (data not shown).\nBaseline characteristics of the flooded and the control populations in spring 2011.\nCharacteristics	Flooded Area	Control Areas	p-Value	 		Area 1	Area 2	Area 3	Area 4		 	n	10,081	22,654	40,119	38,463		 	Male sex, n (%)	5168 (51.3%)	10,874 (48.0%)	19,402 (48.4%)	18,270 (47.5%)	&lt;0.001	 	Age (year), mean +- SD	49.6 +- 16.6	49.1 +- 17.7	48.5 +- 17.3	51.7 +- 18.3	&lt;0.001	 	Comorbidity score, n (%)						 	0	9154 (90.8%)	20,325 (89.7%)	36,377 (90.7%)	33,844 (88.0%)	&lt;0.001	 	1	760 (7.5%)	1843 (8.1%)	2995 (7.4%)	3625 (9.4%)	 	&gt;=2	167 (1.7%)	486 (2.2%)	747 (1.9%)	994 (2.6%)	 	Mental disorders, n (%)	548 (5.4%)	1546 (6.8%)	2334 (5.8%)	2243 (5.8%)	&lt;0.001	 	Diabetes, n (%)	790 (7.8%)	2041 (9.0%)	3221 (8.0%)	3792 (9.9%)	&lt;0.001	 	Hypertension, n (%)	2328 (23.1%)	5475 (24.2%)	9282 (23.1%)	9989 (26.0%)	&lt;0.001	 	History of CVD, n (%)	1021 (10.1%)	2620 (11.6%)	4170 (10.4%)	4906 (12.8%)	&lt;0.001	 	\nCVD: cardiovascular diseases, n: number, SD: standard deviation.\n3.1. Flooded Area in Spring 2011 vs. Spring 2010 and Spring 2012\nIn the flooded area, the rate of acute CVD during spring 2011 was 0.47%, which corresponded to 47 events reported in an ED visit or reported as the main diagnosis of a hospitalization (Table 2). A higher incidence of acute cardiovascular events was observed during this period compared with the same 4-month period of the previous year (spring 2010: 0.37%) and the year after (spring 2012: 0.38%) (Table 2). However, as shown in Figure 3, this increase was not statistically significant according to the logistic regression analysis, which controlled for patient-level cofounders (spring 2011 vs. spring 2010 OR 1.25, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.92; spring 2011 vs. spring 2012 OR 1.27, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.92). The difference in the rate of acute CVD observed in spring 2011 when compared to spring 2012 increased noticeably when the analyses were performed in a sub-population with a history of CVD and was almost statistically significant (OR 1.69, 95% CI 0.98 to 2.92) (Figure 4).\nOccurrence of acute CVD during springs 2010 to 2012, and according to the different study areas.\nAreas 	Spring 2010; n (%)	Spring 2011; n (%)	Spring 2012; n (%)	 	Flooded Area	37/10,006 (0.37%)	47/10,081 (0.47%)	38/10,128 (0.38%)	 	Area 2	122/22,456 (0.54%)	113/22,654 (0.50%)	121/22,789 (0.53%)	 	Area 3	220/39,807 (0.55%)	208/40,119 (0.52%)	193/40,408 (0.48%)	 	Area 4	207/38,162 (0.54%)	230/38,463 (0.60%)	234/38,517 (0.61%)	 	\nCVD: cardiovascular diseases. n: number.

Flooded Area (Area 1) vs. Control Areas (Areas 2, 3 and 4) in Spring 2011\nAs seen in Table 2, a lower rate of acute cardiovascular events was observed in the flooded area (0.47%) when compared with the control areas (0.50%, 0.52%, and 0.60%, respectively) in spring 2011. However, as previously mentioned, the population in the flooded area had lower proportions of individuals with a high comorbidity index, and with a medical history of diabetes, hypertension, CVD, as well as mental disorders. In fact, in the adjusted model, the flooded area was positively (but not statistically) associated with a slight increase in acute CVD during spring 2011 when compared with control areas 2 and 4 (Area 1 vs. Area 2 OR 1.11, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.59; Area 1 vs. Area 4 OR 1.08, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.47) over the same period (Figure 3). \n4. Discussion\nThe present study did not detect a significant association between the flood of Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu in spring 2011 and the occurrence of acute CVD when controlling for patient-level cofounders. While the principal p-values were far from significant, the estimated effect sizes were large: an increase in the odds of 25%-27% in the flooded area when compared with the same area the previous year and the year after, and an increase of up to 69% when the analysis was restricted to individuals with a history of CVD. This suggests that the population affected by the flood was too small to provide the statistical power to answer the question, and leaves open a substantial possibility for a real and large effect.\nPrevious studies have reported a positive relationship between natural disasters and the occurrence of CVD. Nakamura et al. compared the appearance of acute heart failures between the area devastated by the tsunami in Japan in 2011 and a control area. Using a ratio that represented the degree and extent of damage caused by the tsunami in the residential area of each town (percent tsunami flood area per built-up area) to define the study groups, the authors reported a significant increase in acute heart failures for several weeks in the area devastated by the tsunami (maximum peak observed three to four weeks following the disaster). Moreover, they observed that this growth was significantly correlated with the degree of tsunami-induced destruction in residential areas or with the number of evacuees. Aoki et al. also observed that the weekly occurrences of CVD, including heart failure, acute coronary syndrome, stroke and cardiac pulmonary arrest were all significantly increased after the Great East Japan Earthquake in 2011 when compared with the previous three years, independently of age, gender, or residence area. Monitoring data of the hurricane Katrina, which aimed to evaluate the long-term incidence of acute myocardial infarctions in the 3 years following the storm, showed an important cardiovascular mortality and increased medical consultations related to CVD when compared with the two-year period before the event. However, the post-Katrina group had a greater prevalence of unemployment, lack of medical insurance, smokers, medical noncompliance, and first-time hospitalizations, history of coronary artery disease, multiple vessel disease and percutaneous coronary intervention (all p &lt; 0.05). The evaluation between groups was not adjusted for these confounders.\nMany hypotheses may explain the lack of significant effect between the flood and acute cardiovascular events in the present study. First of all, the flood of Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu was less severe and damaging than the ones reported in the literature so far. Indeed, the tsunami in Japan in 2011 caused thousands of deaths and major material damages. Secondly, the limited extent of the flood of Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu and the emergency measures in place may have contributed to the fast delocalization of people and the quick management and support of those in need, unlike other flood disasters. In Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu, disaster victims received housing and food. Additionally, access to health care services was not affected: ambulatory clinics, hospitals and pharmacies were located outside the flooded area. Those factors could have had a positive impact on the prevention of urgent care utilization. In previous studies, one of the hypotheses of the increase of acute CVD was based on the failure in the continuum of health care during the disaster. A study conducted in Japan in 2006 reported a higher prevalence of interruption of medication among subjects in a flooded area that had to be evacuated compared to individuals not affected by the flood (9% vs. 23%), and those who experienced interruption of medication were more likely to have deteriorated their health status one month after the event (OR 4.5, 95% CI 1.2-17.6). Third, unlike other flood disasters, such as the tsunami in Japan, the rising of water levels in Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu was slower and progressive. Thus, people affected by the flood could have had more time to be prepared for the event. Finally, it is known that loss of human life and material damage associated with environmental disasters might have major psychological consequences. Many studies have reported a state of post-traumatic stress after major disasters in the individuals concerned. The intense stress induced during these events may have significant consequences on health, such as cardiovascular health. Some evidences suggest that acute stress may be related to adverse cardiac outcomes particularly in individuals at risk or with history of CVD through the activation of the sympathetic nervous system. In fact, it may lead, among others, to the elevation of the heart rate and the blood pressure as well as a transient increase in blood viscosity. Kershaw et al. have demonstrated that highly stressful life events were associated with a higher incidence of CVD independently of sociodemographic factors and depressive symptoms. However, in the case of Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu, the stress-induced in individuals affected by the flood may have been attenuated by the absence of deaths (as reported by the media and authorities) as well as the rapid delocalization and support of the victims. Overall, 7000 psychosocial interventions were made during the period of the disaster. All these factors may have resulted in fewer impacts on the physical and emotional plan of the victims.\n5. Strengths and Limitations\nThe major strength of this study is the use of a GIS approach based on hydraulic and topographic data in order to extrapolate the extent of the flood. This method is a powerful tool that can easily be transposed to other events to investigate public health issues. Moreover, the use of data from provincial databases permitted accurate assessment of the occurrence of acute CVD among the studied populations.\nSeveral limitations should be mentioned. First, it was not possible to evaluate the cardiovascular mortality associated with the flood because this information was not available at the time of the study. Second, it is possible that some individuals who had a residence in Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu, were not at home during the flood period. However, every adult covered by the public health insurance who had a residence in the flooded area during this period was considered as the case-population. This may have resulted in an underestimation of the incidence of acute cardiovascular events for the population living in the flooded area. Finally, the lack of statistical power did not allow us to clearly establish an association between the flood and the occurrence of acute CVD.\n6. Conclusions\nIn conclusion, there were about 25% to 27% more cases of acute cardiovascular events during the flood period (spring 2011) at Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu as compared with the same period in 2010 and 2012. This increase was even more pronounced in individuals with a medical history of CVD (up to 69% more cases of acute CVD within this population). However, the impact of the flood of Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu on acute CVD could not be established. It may be explained by several factors: (1) the relatively minor impact and extent of the disaster; (2) the access to health care services was not affected by the flood having minor impacts on the continuum of healthcare during the disaster; and (3) the efficacy and the rapidity of the management at a regional and at a provincial level. Further studies, based on a similar methodology but with larger sample sizes, may be needed to provide more robust evidences. \nAuthor Contributions\nAlain Vanasse, Alan Cohen, Patrick Bergeron, Claudia Blais, Diane Belanger and Fateh Chebana participated to conception and design of the study as well as in the interpretation of the data; Josiane Courteau participated in the statistical analysis, interpretation of the data and helped draft the manuscript; Roxanne Dault participated in the interpretation of the data and drafted the manuscript; Patrick Bergeron participated to conception and design of the study as well as in the acquisition and interpretation of the data; Louis Rochette participated in the acquisition of the data, helped in the statistical analysis and in the interpretation of the data.

Initiative","abstract":"Background\nEpidemiologic studies have yielded mixed findings on the association of psychosocial stressors with cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk.\n\n In this study, we examined associations of stressful life events (SLE) and social strain with incident coronary heart disease (CHD) and stroke (overall, and for hemorrhagic and ischemic strokes) independent of sociodemographic characteristics, and we evaluated whether these relationships were explained by traditional behavioral and biological risk factors.\n\n\nMethods and Results\nData from approximately 82 000 Women's Health Initiative Observational Study participants were used for the SLE and social strain analyses, respectively.\n\n Participants were followed for events for up to 18.0 years (median, 14.0).\n\n Separate Cox proportional hazards models were generated to estimate associations of each stress measure with incident CVD.\n\n After adjusting for sociodemographic characteristics and depressive symptoms, higher SLE and social strain were associated with higher incident CHD and stroke (each P trend &lt;0.05).\n\n Hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals were 1.12 (1.01, 1.25) for incident CHD and 1.14 (1.01, 1.28) for incident stroke among participants reporting high versus low SLE.\n\n Findings were similar for social strain.\n\n Associations were attenuated with further adjustment for mediating behavioral and biological risk factors.\n\n Findings were similar for associations of SLE with ischemic stroke and hemorrhagic stroke, but social strain was only associated with ischemic stroke.\n\n\nConclusions\nHigher SLE and social strain were associated with higher incident CVD independent of sociodemographic factors and depressive symptoms, but not behavioral and biological risk factors.\n\n\n","id":"PMC4309050","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Blackwell Publishing Ltd","authors":[{"firstname":"Kiarri

Introduction\nThe United Nation World Conference on Disaster Risk Reduction held in Sendai, Japan on 14-18 March 2015 enforced the Hyogo Framework for Action, approved by the 168 member-states in 2005, and presented the Sendai Declaration aiming to further improve the multipronged response to disasters. The Declaration paid special attention to building community resilience, engaging and empowering vulnerable populations, including children, elderly, and individuals with special needs. The Bloomberg Business Magazine recently reported the cost of damages from Harvey, Irma, and Maria hurricanes at about $202.6 billion, almost 100 times of $3.2 billion funds that the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has obligated to public assistance after Hurricane Katrina to repair and rebuild public infrastructure, such as bridges, roads, schools, hospitals and sewer treatment facilities.\nHurricane Katrina was a harrowing experience for those impacted on 29 August 2005, when it hit the Gulf Coast. Homes were destroyed, two million people were displaced, and survivors experienced health effects that could be long-lasting. Orleans, Jefferson, and St. Bernard parishes were the most affected, containing 95% of Katrina's victims, and approximately 80% of New Orleans was flooded. A 2011 technical report by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) stated that Hurricane Katrina was the costliest hurricane of all time, and the third most deadly and intense since 1900. It set records for the greatest count of tropical storms and hurricanes and tied the record for the most major hurricanes in a 2-year period.\nThe storm disproportionately affected older adults, black Americans and low-income communities. There were an estimated 971 deaths in Louisiana as a result of Hurricane Katrina, and the earliest and most numerous deaths were seen in the elderly. Almost half of all the deceased were older than 75 years old, and an additional 26% were of the ages 60 to 75. Besides deaths, the vulnerable elderly people were substantially overrepresented among the evacuees:a population potentially predisposed to a high level of psychological distress exacerbated by severe disaster exposure, lack of economic and social resources, and inadequacy in government response. In Orleans Parish, the mortality rate for black residents aged 18 or order was 1.7 to 4 times greater than that of the white. In New Orleans, damaged areas had higher proportions of black residents and poor households than undamaged areas (45.8% versus 26.4%, and 20.9% versus 15.3%, respectively). Possible reasons for such post-disaster racial health disparities included insufficient supply of medication and limited access to need resources. Analyses revealed that black respondents had a limited access to a 3-day supply of their medications and this difference could be due to prescription drug coverage in health insurance plans, as well as access and proximity to pharmacy. \nThe most recent hurricane seasons repeatedly demonstrated that the needs of the elderly population in the United States during and following a disaster were often neglected. The study of nationally representative panel survey of older Americans indicated that older adults in lower income status had lower preparedness level than those in higher income. Most disaster response models focus on acute injury treatment, environmental risk management, and infectious disease prevention. However, interviews and focus groups with both providers and survivors' contrast with the need to also include continued care for survivors with chronic conditions such as cardiovascular disease. Among the Katrina survivors, 41-74% had one or more chronic conditions. These survivors could not obtain medications due to availability or affordability, were unable to access medical records onsite or at a distance, and had limited healthcare resulting from the most significant efflux of the healthcare workforce known in U.S. history. It is also possible that CVD disproportionally affected black survivors: in general, compared to white patients, patients of color experience higher CVD rates and risk factors, encounter more barriers to diagnosis, are given lower quality healthcare, and endure worse health outcomes. In addition, black patients experience lower cardiac intervention rates, lower admission rates, and shorter cardiac care unit stays compared to white patients. \nThe complex nature a disaster typically triggers a series of cascading responses peaking at different times and forming a unique signature of each event. Such signatures have been observed in many studies analyzing the health effects of natural disasters. A study analyzing the effect of a 2011 tsunami on acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF) reported a peak in the weekly number of ADHF cases 3 to 4 weeks following the tsunami, after which number of cases per week returned to pre-disaster level. Acute coronary syndrome, stroke, and cardiopulmonary arrest, pulmonary thromboembolism, and infectious endocarditis cases exhibited both a rapid increase and decline, whereas heart failure cases remained significantly increased for up to 7 weeks after the earthquake. Examining the consequences of Hurricane Sandy in 2012, researchers have detected increases in hospitalizations and deaths due to myocardial infarction and stroke during the 2 weeks after landfall, compared to the same 2 weeks from the 5 previous years. An increase of acute myocardial infarctions (AMI) admissions during 3 years after Hurricane Katrina, as compared to the 2-year period before the storm was noted. Another study demonstrated that, during the 6 years following Katrina, the number of admissions for AMI tripled. Researchers inferred that the higher incidences of severe cardiovascular events observed during natural disasters could be attributed to elevated stress, greater physical activity, change in blood rheology, diminished attention or ability to address medical needs, and insufficient emergency services. Researchers credit lack of food and medications, which were also a reported problem following Hurricane Katrina, a possible cause. \nThe difficulties with collecting information during and after disasters are well recognized; underserved communities typically suffered due to limited resources allocated to data collection. The research on how health and health care disparities impact response to and recovery from a disaster, especially among diverse and underserved populations is in great need for thorough evaluation. The utilization of national databases of medical claim of patients had illustrated a strong potential in assessing environmental impacts on vulnerable populations. The Center of Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) has been maintaining uniformly collected hospitalization records with a coverage rate of ~98% of US adults aged 65 years old and older. The large scale and rapid progression of natural disasters limit opportunities for detailed data collection over time, yet the time series analysis of medical records can help in recreating the short-term and long-term responses at a refined temporal and geographical scale.\nThe objective of this study is to compare the daily rates of CVD hospitalizations before, during, and after Hurricane Katrina among older adults of Louisiana using CMS records. We established the critical periods in CVD responses to Katrina and examined hospitalization rates for black and white residents in three communities using segmented regression models adapted to time series analysis. We selected three parishes (equivalent to &quot;counties&quot; in other states): Orleans and Jefferson, two densely populated parishes most affected by the landfall and subsequent floods due to being on the storm track as well as East Baton Rouge:the parish that accommodated many evacuees. We hypothesized that there was a significant difference in the number of cases, rates, and in the demographic profiles for the different periods. We also hypothesized that black elderly adults would be disproportionately impacted by the storm, as seen through higher CVD rates compared to white adults. While studies on the effects of natural disasters, including earthquakes on CVD exist, those focusing on hurricanes are sparse. This is therefore one of the few studies analyzing the effect of hurricanes on CVD specifically. Results from this study can help further our understanding of natural disaster impacts on CVD and help health authorities better prepare for upcoming seasonal events. Our long-term goal is to pave the way for a solid methodology in assessing the impact of a disaster in order to better understand the cardiovascular needs of our elderly population and to ultimately advance disaster planning and long-term recovery efforts. \n2. Materials and Methods\n2.1. CVD Records\nMedical claims were obtained from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS). For the USA, 21,363,136 records of CVD hospitalizations were retrieved from the database in SQL Server 2014 Management Studio for all relevant International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9M CM) codes in any of 9 diagnostic fields for patients aged 65 and older from 1 January 2005 to 31 December 2006. The codes included: 390-398, 401-407, 420-438, 440-449, 451-459. In Louisiana, there were 383,552 hospitalizations, including 119,612 cases with CVD listed as primary diagnoses. The distribution of specific sub-codes is shown in Appendix A Table A1. Of all the selected records, 17,769 were for Orleans Parish, 21,499 for Jefferson Parish, and 24,699 for East Baton Rouge Parish. Each record contained information on date of admission, sex, age, race, county and zip code of residence. Based on the county code of residence, we compiled counts for each county in the state of Louisiana. (Note, that in Louisiana, a &quot;parish&quot; is equivalent to a &quot;county,&quot; which is a more generic term, so both terms can be used interchangeably.) We intentionally removed the first 6 days and the last 12 days to reduce the error associated with incomplete reporting at the beginning and at the end of the study period. Therefore, we reduced the study period to 710 days from 7 January 2005 to 17 December 2006. Based on the date of admission and patient's race, we compiled time series of daily counts for the study period for three selected counties or parishes (Orleans: 17,394 cases, Jefferson: 21,057, and East Baton Rouge: 24,147 cases) for black, white and all adults aged 65 or above (see Appendix A Table A2 for an example of the first 10 rows; full data set is available on request).\n2.2. Census Data and Hospitalization Rates\nCensus data for the population 65 years and older on the County level was obtained from Census.gov for years 2005 and 2006. Because these are not Census years, American Community Survey (ACS) estimates and Intercensal estimates were used to supplement the Census data. Hospitalization rates were calculated for spatial mapping and temporal analysis. For spatial mapping county-specific hospitalization rates were calculated by dividing counts of CVD cases per day for all period, pre-Katrina and post-Katrina periods by the parish population (65+) with the multiplier of 100,000. For temporal analysis, for each of the three parishes the daily hospitalization rates were calculated by dividing counts of CVD cases per day by the interpolated estimates of parish population with the multiplier of 10,000. The 2005 population counts were used for the period from 7 January 2005 to 29 August 2005, the day that Hurricane Katrina struck the Gulf coast. Hurricane Katrina caused a mass exodus of people from Orleans Parish and the surrounding area. Following Hurricane Katrina, it was more reasonable to use the 2006 population counts to reflect the loss or gain in population in a parish. \n2.3. Mapping\nWe mapped the state of Louisiana populations by county, population density, daily hospitalization cases, and average daily hospitalization rates using ArcGIS 10.3.1 (Esri, Redlands, CA, USA). Because ACS estimates were not available for every parish in Louisiana, maps were produced with intercensal estimates for the whole study period, as well as pre- and post-Katrina's landfall periods (see Appendix A Table A3). Storm track was mapped using data from the Mississippi Automated Resource Information System (MARIS).\n2.4. Statistical Analysis\nIdentifying critical periods using a loess smoother: A part of preliminary analysis, we superimposed daily time series of rates with a loess smoother to assess the overall trend and weekly pattern:  where  is CVD hospitalization rate at day ,  represents the intercept, and  represents the slope of the smoothed regression line. The study days were numbered from 1 to 710 (the total number of days being analyzed in the time series), starting from 7 January 2005 and ending on 17 December 2006. The span parameter alpha of the loess smoother lo(.) was selected to be equal to 7/710 to reflect the weekly pattern that has also been previously reported for admissions due to AMI, a CVD subtype. From the analysis of the Orleans Parish residents we identified six time period of interest to characterize the periods before evacuation, before the landfall, immediately after landfall, and recovery periods, which are also supported by reports about Katrina. \nSegmented regression model: The study time period of 710 days divided into six intervals (T1, T2, T3, T4, T5, T6) were marked with knots, or endpoints: a, b, c, d, e at days 225, 238, 247, 275, and 303, respectively. Using the selected periods, we develop a segmented linear regression model, as follows: where \nThus, \nThis long expression can be summarized as follows: where  are the locations of the break points,  is CVD hospitalization rate at day . The regression coefficients  and  are the slopes for the selected time intervals.\nSensitivity analysis with a broken-stick model: As part of sensitivity analysis we estimated the intercept (or the value at the critical endpoints) and slope values using a broken-stick model for each pair of adjacent periods, as follow: where  is daily CVD hospitalization rate,  and  represent the time for adjacent intervals,  is the intercept, and  and  are the slopes for the adjacent time intervals. The results of the models along with the quality of fit are presented in Appendix A Table A4. The segmented model and the broken-stick model were run for total, black and white patients for each parish. All data processing and model building was done using R.\n3. Results\nFor the 710-day study period, there were 383,552 hospitalizations due to CVD in Louisiana, including 119,612 cases with CVD listed as primary cause of hospitalization (Appendix A Table A1). The 420-429 ICD codes, referring to acute pericarditis, endocarditis, myocarditis, cardiomyopathy, conduction disorders, cardiac dysrhythmias, heart failure, and other complications of heart disease represented the majority (40%) of CVD types for all subpopulations. For black patients, hospitalizations due to hypertensive heart diseases (401-405 ICD codes) were twice higher than for white patients (9.8% vs. 4.7%), in contrast with ischemic heart disease.\nACS-derived demographic data for each parish, or county of the state of Louisiana were mapped (Figure 1; data are provided in Appendix A Table A3). Figure 1 shows geographic distribution of population aged 65 and older and the average number of daily CVD cases per county (Panel A) and a close-up for the Orleans, Jefferson, and East Baton Rouge Parishes (Panel B). These three parishes had high population density before and after Katrina's landfall (Periods D and F). Orleans Parish and Jefferson Parish were closest to the storm track and had the highest number of people affected by the hurricane.\n3.1. Identification of Critical Periods\nWe identified six time periods of interest using loess-smoothing technique as shown in Table 1 and Figure 2 and examined the rates for each selected parish accordingly. The daily time series of daily CVD hospitalization rates per 10,000 elderly adults (shown as points) with the superimposed loess-smoothed curve (shown as line) are depicted in Figure 2 for Orleans Parish (Panel A), Jefferson Parish (Panel B), and East Baton Rouge Parish (Panel C), respectively. The landfall occurred on 29 August 2005 was indicated by a border between Periods T2 and T3, right after day 240. In Figure 2, the different hues and capital letters (T1-T6) indicate six distinct time periods according to Table 1.\nIn Figure 1 we mapped CVD counts and rates corresponding to the time periods before (Period T1, Panels C and D) and soon after the storm (Periods T3 and T4, Panels E and F). Prior to the storm the number of older residents in the East Baton Rouge Parish was comparable with the Orleans Parish. After the storm it received evacuees, including over five thousand older adults. Although St Bernard Parish also had a high rate of CVD, however due to a low population density the number of hospitalization records were insufficient for the further analysis.\nAs shown in Table 2, Orleans Parish had a notably high average daily CVD hospitalization rate of 17.0 +- 10.23 cases/day per 10,000 people aged 65+ after the storm (Periods T3 and T4), while the number of residents declined by almost 17,000 people. In East Baton Rouge the total number of older adults increased by almost 5000 people, although with some decline in CVD rates.\n3.2. Segmented Regression Analysis\nThe time series of daily rates with the superimposed fit from the segmented regression for each of six periods and for all three parishes are shown in Figure 3 (Panels A, B and C). As shown in Table 3, In Orleans Parish, the average CVD hospitalization rates was 7.25 cases/day per 10,000 persons and was decreasing slowly for over 6 months before Katrina (Period T1). During the evacuation week (Period T2), it dropped to 3.83 cases/day (Tukey-test, p = 0.002, as compared to T1). In the week following Katrina (Period T3), the average daily rate increased drastically to 21.18 (p &lt; 0.0001) by 3.12 additional cases per day. \nThe rate reached its peak of 45.36 cases/day on Sunday, 4 September, 6 days after Hurricane Katrina's landfall. In the following month (Period T4) the daily rate remained significantly high 15.52 cases/day (p &lt; 0.0001) compared to pre-storm, pre-evacuation Period T1, but was decreasing by 3.56 cases per day. Two months after the landfall (Period T5) the average rate returned to a pre-storm, pre-evacuation level and then started to decline in Period T6 in manner similar to Period T1.\nAs shown in Table 3, in Jefferson Parish the hospitalization rate was increasing from an average rate of 5.01 cases/day during evacuation Period T2, one week before landfall, to 8.18 cases/day in a week after landfall (p &lt; 0.05, compared to T1). The highest rate 12.7 cases/day was observed on Saturday 3 September, 5 days after Hurricane Katrina's landfall. The month following the peak, rates remained significantly high, at 7.26 cases/day (p = 0.001). Two months after, average rate returned to 5.36 cases/day, similar to the pre-evacuation pre-storm Period T1 (p = 0.9). \nIn contrast with Orleans, in East Baton Rouge Parish while the average hospitalization rates remained stable over all study periods except for a week after the landfall Period T3, when the rates were rapidly declining by 0.47 cases per day (p &lt; 0.001). In the month following landfall, the average rate of 6.55 cases/day was a significantly lower as compared to 8.69 cases/day per 10,000 persons in Period T1 (p = 0.003). During the evacuation and after the landfall (Periods T2-T6), rates in East Baton Rouge Parish appeared to change in the opposite direction of Orleans Parish and Jefferson Parish.\n3.3. Racial Differences in CVD Rates\nWhen average hospitalization rates are calculated separately for black and white older adults for two main periods: pre-Katrina (Period T1) and during periods T3 and T4: starting the day after landfall and ending 28 days after the peak response (see Table 2), several differences are revealed. The proportion of black residents in Orleans Parish was higher than in Jefferson and East Baton Rouge Parish before and after the storm, yet the reduction in population in Orleans Parish was almost twice as large among black residents than white residents. In all parishes the racial differences in CVD rates were notable either before or after the storm (Table 2 and Table 3, Figure 4). In Orleans Parish, the highest CVD rates, which stand out as outliers about a week after landfall, are all for black adults. They experienced a significant increase in rates soon after landfall of 26.3 and 17.5 cases/day in Periods T3 and T4, respectively (p &lt; 0.001, Table 3). The direct comparison of average daily rates between black and white older adults post landfall (19.8 +- 13.7 vs. 14.5 +- 7.8, p &lt; 0.05, Table 2) shows significantly higher rates black patients. In Jefferson and East Baton Rouge Parish, the CVD rates were significantly higher in black than in white older adults before the storm.\nIn the most affected Orleans Parish, white adults also experienced significant increases immediately after the storm reaching 16.6 and 13.8 cases/day in Periods T3 and T4, respectively (p &lt; 0.02, Table 3) but of a lesser extent. The week following landfall, each day brought new hospitalizations: on average 3.96 +- 0.25 for blacks and 2.32 +- 0.20 for whites. During the post-Katrina period of stabilization and recovery in all parishes the average daily rates in both black and white adults were consistently lower than before the storm.\n4. Discussion\nOur study demonstrates significant changes in CVD hospitalization rates in Orleans Parish, both during and following Hurricane Katrina's landfall. On Friday, 26 August, two days before the landfall, the governor of Louisiana, Kathleen Blanco, declared a state of emergency. On Saturday, 27 August, Orleans Parish, Jefferson Parish and St. Bernard Parish ordered voluntary evacuations, recommending that all residents evacuate, particularly those living in lower areas. Mandatory evacuation was issued the day before landfall, on Sunday, 28 August. On Wednesday 31 August, two days after landfall, New Orleans mayor Ray Nagin estimates that 50,000 to 100,000 people remain in the city, which officials say is 80% flooded. Our analysis demonstrated that during evacuation period the daily rates of CVD had significantly decreased in Orleans Parish. The rates then spiked immediately after Katrina's landfall in all older adults, especially in black residents. The rates appear to stabilize about two months after the landfall, coinciding with the clearing of floodwaters from New Orleans and the end of the emergency period, which lasted from the disaster event to the &quot;dewatering&quot; of New Orleans.\nThe surge in CVD observed in Louisiana after Hurricane Katrina could be due to many apparent reasons. Psychosocial stressors, lack of medication and proper support system are likely to play a key role. After Katrina, multiple reports have indicated high rates of psychosocial stress and post-traumatic stress, as well as an almost threefold increase in suicide rates. Survivors had to cope with stressors such as searching for food and shelter, relocating, crowding, being in financial hardship, and dealing with insurance companies and social services. These stressors not only reminded survivors of their trauma, but also introduced negative impacts to their capacity to cope. This is a specific health concern given that psychological stress has emerged as a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Stressors such as hurricanes and other natural disasters can cause chronic and acute mental stress, which can then trigger cardiovascular events. After all, traditional cardiac risk factors only account for half of the causes of CVD, with most of the remaining risk explained by psychosocial factors.\nThere was also an estimated doubling of mental illness incidences following the storm: survivors who relocated to Oklahoma exhibited distress, disability, and post-traumatic stress disorders (PTSD) symptoms. Survivors had an increased and abnormal baseline heart rate compared with that of controls, especially for those with depressions. Some survivors had decreased heart rate reactivity and heart rate variability, which are independent risk factors for cardiovascular disease. In addition, an earlier study by the same group found immune system changes in a group of young, healthy Katrina survivors, stating that in the presence of PTSD, they had increased IL-6 levels, with unknown cardiovascular health complications. In fact, heart conditions were reported to be one of the top three major causes of death among Louisiana victims.\nAcute CVD events are known to be triggered by sudden emotional or physical stressors, such as unanticipated natural disasters, which are known for causing some of the strongest acute and subacute types of psychological stress. It is likely to be the case for our study, when the majority of hospitalizations were due to acute conditions such as pericarditis, endocarditis, myocarditis, cardiomyopathy, cardiac dysrhythmias, and heart failure. The impact of psychosocial stress on cardiovascular health can be understood through the concept of allostasis:the ability to maintain stability through change, allowing one to respond to environmental demands, such as shifts in our physical state or dealing with stressful situations. Both the sympathetic nervous system and hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis are involved in allostatic responses. The adrenal medulla and sympathetic nerves release catecholamines when the sympathetic nervous system or HPA axis are activated, and the hypothalamus releases corticotrophin-releasing hormones that mediate the pituitary's release of corticotrophin, and thus, the adrenal cortex's release of cortisol. Allostatic load then results from the allostatic mediator hormones changing cellular physiological and pathophysiological responses. Stress can trigger allostatic load, which can eventually, in turn, trigger cardiovascular disease. It is very possible that Hurricane Katrina, which was both a sudden catastrophic event, and thus a source of both immediate and chronic stress, could have triggered allostatic load, which then led to the sharp increase in CVD rates observed after landfall, both immediately and even a month later.\nIt is worth noting that mortality rates for black adults was 1.7 to 4 times higher compared to rates for white adults in Orleans Parish. Higher mortality rates were also seen for black adults 75 years and older compared to white adults of the same age group. Low-income households, minority households, and households with elderly or disabled people are also less likely to evacuate than other households. The already-existing gap in CVD rates between black and white older adults, has predisposed blacks to be more greatly impacted in the aftermath of the storm. It may appear that, perhaps the black adults were experiencing CVD sooner and at higher rates, that on average not as many survived, especially those prone to CVD; thus, rates of CVD deaths for the black population fell in the months after due to the loss of these individuals. Another possibility could be that access to healthcare and other resources differed significantly for these two racial groups following the storm, so black individuals were still experiencing CVD events, but were faced with limited hospital access. Studies have indicated that black individuals have a higher likelihood of experiencing PTSD following a hurricane, compared to white individuals, and reported a greater impact of loss of services compared to white adults. Yet another explanation could be that black residents lived in neighborhoods that were affected by the storm at a greater magnitude, and thus left and returned to Orleans at lower rates than the white population, especially soon after the storm. Damaged areas were also more likely to be comprised on households with low socioeconomic level. Both race and class are intertwined in this case as a part of the residential segregation reported in Orleans Parish, which results in polarized social capital for those groups as well as access to different institutions regarding emergency preparedness. Stakeholders should take this into account and ensure access to medical care and emergency preparedness for all individuals, regardless of neighborhood, socioeconomic status, and race.\nIn East Baton Rouge Parish, CVD rates were higher on average for black adults, confirming what has been reported in literature previously. East Baton Rouge Parish received evacuees, no significant changes in CVD hospitalization rates were noted, and the pattern was somewhat reversed to the observed in Orleans. This lack of detected change could exist for several reasons, including lack of tracking patient mobility and location of receiving care. First, in comparing rates across parishes, racial populations and time periods we rely on the population estimates that might be not accurate. Typically, the Intercensal estimates are updated yearly, and thus do not capture well fluctuations in population due to disaster related migrations, displacement, and losses. Furthermore, by focusing on the elderly population, which is already a subset of the evacuee population, we are not able to detect the impact on population younger than 65 years old, who yet could overwhelm health care facilities. There were not only people evacuating out of New Orleans, but also evacuees who returned eventually, as well as an influx of new people into the region due to construction jobs following the storm. From East Baton Rouge Parish, some evacuees also returned to Orleans Parish, especially due to its close proximity compared to other cities that accommodated many evacuees, such as Atlanta or Dallas. \nWe merged population data from American Community Survey estimates and Intercensal estimates to supplement the census data and account for a mass exodus from affected area; however, it would be more assuring to have reliable public resources to properly account for changes in population following disaster. Such data repositories should serve many purposes, including disaster mitigation and relieve and assessing the quality and efficiency in controlling the impact of a disaster. The study conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention soon after Hurricane Katrina revealed that chronic disease and related conditions, including cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases accounted for a significant proportion of visits to emergency treatment facilities in and around New Orleans, particularly among people ages 60 years or older. This study led us to think about importance of better harmonization of all available data, including hospitalization claims and surveillance records.\nThis study used patient's county of residence for billing purposed and is unlikely to track well where patients received their care. This phenomenon was observed in studying hospitalizations due to seasonal pneumonia and influenza using CMS claims. We had utilized the information contained in the CMS records represents that of the beneficiary residency, and not the provider. Survivors from Orleans Parish or Jefferson Parish may have received care in East Baton Rouge Parish, but this type of information is not readily available. Due to lack of knowledge how reliably a patient's residential address, recorded by the CMS database, reflect the actual patient location, we roughly assessed hospital utilization. We estimated that before the Katrina's landfall 97% of Orleans Parish patients were treated in Louisiana; during and two months after the landfall, 45-56% received health in hospitals outside of Louisiana; and afterwards 78% of patients with Orleans Parish county code of residence were treated in Louisiana. The access and utilization of healthcare facilities could have changed during disasters and we were not able to account for such changes. This crucial information is often scattered among various agencies and not readily available. \nThis report is one of the few papers discussing the impact of hurricanes on CVD hospitalization rates, as well as the disparities in rates between white and black elderly adults. We offered a novel application of segmented regression model to explore in detail a complex dynamic process with rapid rise and fall in CVD hospitalizations. Further research is recommended to identify patterns in CVD hospitalizations by subtype, as well as any differences in peak intensity between subtypes. We used Medicare records, which provide a broad coverage for the majority of American adults 65 years and older. While this data set is uniquely useful, it could not be used to provide timely reports during and after emergency, as it requires at least 6 months to request and assemble the records. It is expensive to operate and maintain even for experienced researchers. Yet, hurricanes are striking seasonally on a regular basis, so a solution for timely and reliable reporting is critical to develop proper preparedness strategies for hurricanes, whose impacts are consistently intensifying in the region. The presented findings provide the basis for planning resource allocation, among other disaster needs.\nThere are many questions we were still unable to address: What were the mechanisms underlying the disparities? Why did we see the disparities? What other forms of disparity occurred beyond race? After the event, did the disparity go away? Did the recovery for each group occur with the same speed or did difference occur in recovery by racial groups? Studies suggest that preparedness of black elders was not significantly different from that of whites; however, older black adults in lower income status were significantly less prepared for disaster than other groups. This study only examined records 16 months post-Katrina, however the recovery from economic, physical and psychological damages may last for many years. The impact caused by hurricane damage, loss, or stress can be alleviated by housing, finance, and stress management. Studies of Kobe earthquake survivors show that &quot;through event evaluation, social ties and community rebuilding efforts directly or indirectly facilitated the reframing of earthquake experiences into positive narratives&quot;. The reasons for the steady decline in CVD rates post-Katrina remain unclear; it might be due to older adults who were frail moved to other counties or states. We recommend that policies and programs for post-disaster evaluation should also consider the factors of family- and community-level enrichment, empowerment, and commemoration, allowing for the transcending and effective communication of the experience, ultimately leading to lasting improvements. Recovery periods could create opportunities for rebuilding infrastructure and reframing the social relationships, with proper policies and procedures these periods can serve as an optimal juncture to reduce racial, economic and environmental inequalities.\n5. Conclusions\nThis study analyzed changes in elderly CVD hospitalization rates occurring during various time periods before, during, and after Hurricane Katrina in Orleans, East Baton Rouge, and Jefferson parishes, all of which are located near the storm's track. CVD hospitalization rates rose immediately after landfall in both Orleans and Jefferson parishes. This increase in CVD hospitalization rates was prolonged, lasting more than a month after landfall. An increase in CVD rates was higher among elderly black populations compared to elderly white populations in the weeks after landfall, indicating differences in level of impact in these two communities. The 2017-2018 hurricane seasons were particularly devastating, as storms like Harvey, Irma, Maria, and Jose ravaged major metropolitan hubs in Houston, Puerto Rico, and Dominica and prolong disasters of Florence and Michael in Carolinas and Florida. Considering the staggering economic and health impacts of such disasters, lessons from the past hurricanes, including Katrina experience should inform future health management decisions.\nAuthor Contributions\nConceptualization, E.N.N. and K.K.H.C.; Methodology, E.N.N.; Software, N.A.B.; Validation, G.S., K.K.H.C. and E.N.N.; Formal Analysis, N.A.B.; Investigation, K.K.H.C.; Resources, E.N.N.; Data Curation, N.A.B.; Writing-Original Draft Preparation, N.A.B. and E.N.N.; Writing-Review &amp; Editing, E.N.N., G.S., and K.K.H.C.; Visualization, N.A.B. and E.N.N.; Supervision, E.N.N.; Project Administration and IRB Approval, E.N.N.; Funding Acquisition, E.N.N.\nFunding\nFirst author: N.A.B., received support for data analysis and manuscript preparation from the Tufts Post-Baccalaureate Research Program (PREP) grant funded by the NIH R25 GM066567.

earthquake with specific emphasis on pre-hospital medical management during the first days.\n\n\nMethods\nThe study was performed in 2008; an interview based qualitative study using content analysis.\n\n We conducted nineteen interviews with experts and managers responsible for responding to the Bam earthquake, including pre-hospital emergency medical services, the Red Crescent, and Universities of Medical Sciences.\n\n The selection of participants was determined by using a purposeful sampling method.\n\n Sample size was given by data saturation.\n\n\nResults\nThe pre-hospital medical service was divided into three categories; triage, emergency medical care and transportation, each category in turn was identified into facilitators and obstacles.\n\n The obstacles identified were absence of a structured disaster plan, absence of standardized medical teams, and shortage of resources.\n\n The army and skilled medical volunteers were identified as facilitators.\n\n\nConclusions\nThe most compelling, and at the same time amenable obstacle, was the lack of a disaster management plan.\n\n It was evident that implementing a comprehensive plan would not only save lives but decrease suffering and enable an effective praxis of the available resources at pre-hospital and hospital levels.\n\n\n","id":"PMC3114771","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"BioMed

resources issues and Australian Disaster Medical Assistance Teams: results of a national survey of team members","abstract":"Background\nCalls for disaster medical assistance teams (DMATs) are likely to continue in response to international disasters.\n\n As part of a national survey, this study was designed to evaluate Australian DMAT experience in relation to the human resources issues associated with deployment.\n\n\nMethods\nData was collected via an anonymous mailed survey distributed via State and Territory representatives on the Australian Health Protection Committee, who identified team members associated with Australian DMAT deployments from the 2004 South East Asian Tsunami disaster.\n\n\nResults\nThe response rate for this survey was 50% (59/118).\n\n Most personnel had deployed to the Asian Tsunami affected areas with DMAT members having significant clinical and international experience.\n\n While all except one respondent stated they received a full orientation prior to deployment, only 34% of respondents (20/59) felt their role was clearly defined pre deployment.\n\n Approximately 56% (33/59) felt their actual role matched their intended role and that their clinical background was well suited to their tasks.\n\n Most respondents were prepared to be available for deployment for 1 month (34%, 20/59).\n\n The most common period of notice needed to deploy was 6–12 hours for 29% (17/59) followed by 12–24 hours for 24% (14/59).\n\n The preferred period of overseas deployment was 14–21 days (46%, 27/59) followed by 1 month (25%, 15/59) and the optimum shift period was felt to be 12 hours by 66% (39/59).\n\n The majority felt that there was both adequate pay (71%, 42/59) and adequate indemnity (66%, 39/59).\n\n Almost half (49%, 29/59) stated it was better to work with people from the same hospital and, while most felt their deployment could be easily covered by staff from their workplace (56%, 33/59) and caused an inconvenience to their colleagues (51%, 30/59), it was less likely to interrupt service delivery in their workplace (10%, 6/59) or cause an inconvenience to patients (9%, 5/59).\n\n Deployment was felt to benefit the affected community by nearly all (95%, 56/59) while less (42%, 25/59) felt that there was a benefit for their own local community.\n\n Nearly all felt their role was recognised on return (93%, 55/59) and an identical number (93%, 55/59) enjoyed the experience.\n\n All stated they would volunteer again, with 88% strongly agreeing with this statement.\n\n\nConclusions\nThis study of Australian DMAT members provides significant insights into a number of human resources issues and should help guide future deployments.\n\n The preferred ‘on call’ arrangements, notice to deploy, period of overseas deployment and shift length are all identified.\n\n This extended period of operations needs to be supported by planning and provision of rest cycles, food, temporary accommodation and rest areas for staff.\n\n The study also suggests that more emphasis should be placed on team selection and clarification of roles.\n\n While the majority felt that there was both adequate pay and adequate indemnity, further work clarifying this, based on national conditions of service should be, and are, being explored currently by the state based teams in Australia.\n\n Importantly, the deployment was viewed positively by team members who all stated they would volunteer again, which allows the development of an experienced cohort of team members.\n\n\n","id":"PMC3366111","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Co-Action

Safety from Disasters in I.R.Iran: The Results from Assessment of 224 Hospitals","abstract":"Background and objective: Iran’s hospitals have been considerably affected by disasters during last decade.\n To address this, health system of I.\nR.\nIran has taken an initiative to assess disaster safety of the hospitals using an adopted version of Hospital Safety Index (HSI).\n This article presents the results of disaster safety assessment in 224 Iran’s hospitals.\n\nMethods: A self-assessment approach was applied to assess the disaster safety in 145 items categorized in 3 components including structural, non-structural and functional capacity.\n For each item, safety level was categorized to 3 levels: not safe (0), average safe (1) and high safe (2).\n A raw score was tallied for each safety component and its elements by a simple sum of all the corresponding scores.\n All scores were normalized on a 100 point scale.\n Hospitals were classified to three safety classes according to their normalized total score: low (?34.0), average (34.01-66.0) and high (&gt;66.0).\n\nResults: The average score of all safety components were 32.4 out of 100 (± 12.7 SD).\n 122 hospitals (54.5%) were classified as low safe and 102 hospitals (45.5%) were classified as average safe.\n No hospital was placed in the high safe category.\n Average safety scores out of 100 were 27.3 (±14.2 SD) for functional capacity, 36.0 (±13.9 SD) for non-structural component and 36.0 (±19.0 SD) for structural component.\n Neither the safety classes nor the scores of safety components were significantly associated with types of hospitals in terms of affiliation, function and size (P&gt;0.05).\n\nConclusions: To enhance the hospitals safety for disaster in Iran, we recommend: 1) establishment of a national committee for hospital safety in disasters; 2) supervision on implementation of the safety standards in construction of new hospitals; 3) enhancement of functional readiness and safety of non-structural components while structural retrofitting of the existing hospitals is being taken into consideration, whenever is cost-effective; 4) considering the disaster safety status as the criteria for licensing and accreditation of the hospitals.\n\nKey words: Hospital, safety, disaster, emergency, Iran\nCorrespondence to: Ali Ardalan MD, PhD.\n Tehran University of Medical Sciences,

for Resuming Normal Life After Earthquake: A Qualitative Study on Rural Areas of Iran","abstract":"Background and objective: \nGrowing evidence is indicating that some of disaster affected people face challenges to resume normal life several months after an earthquake.\n However, there is no sufficient in-depth understanding of complex process of resuming normal life after an earthquake in Iran, as one of the most disaster-prone countries in the world, and in rural areas as a particular setting.\n This study aimed to explore challenges of return to normalcy in rural earthquake-stricken areas of Iran.\n\nMethods: \nThe study was conducted using qualitative content analysis method (Graneheim approach).\n Twenty people from the earthquake-stricken areas and seven qualified experts were selected via purposeful sampling .\nData was collected through semi-structured interviews, focus group discussions, and field notes from August 2013 to January 2014. Data collection continued to the point of data saturation (no new information was provided by interviewees).\n Data saturation supported the sample size.\n Data analysis was based on qualitative content analysis principles.\n\nResults:\n“Social uncertainty and confusion” was the most prominent challenge of return to the normal life after earthquake, which was categorized into six concepts of social vulnerability, lack of comprehensive rehabilitation plan, incomplete reconstruction, ignorance of local social capital, waste of assets, and psychological problems.\n\nConclusions: \nFindings showed that social uncertainty and confusion occurs as a result of negligence of some important social aspects in process of returning to the normal life.\n This issue, in turn, can greatly interrupt the normal developmental processes.\n Understanding the challenges of life recovery after disasters will help policy makers consider social rehabilitation as a key factor in facilitation of return to normal life process after earthquakes.\n\nKeywords: Disaster; earthquake; social rehabilitation; social uncertainty.\n ","id":"PMC4323411","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Public Library of Science","authors":[{"firstname":"Fardin","surname":"Alipour","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Hamid Reza","surname":"Khankeh","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Hussain","surname":"Fekrazad","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Mohammad","surname":"Kamali","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Hassan","surname":"Rafiey","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Pooria","surname":"Sarrami Foroushani","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Kevin","surname":"Rowell","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Shokoufeh","surname":"Ahmadi","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Disaster risk assessment","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1097/phh.0b013e3182928e63","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Los Angeles county department of public health's health hazard assessment","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1142/9789812701602_0064","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Iran's strategy on natural disaster risk management","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Health management in disasters with focusing on rehabilitation","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"National report of the Islamic Republic of Iran on disaster reduction","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]}]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"The Most Expensive U.S. Hurricane Season Ever: By the Numbers.

heat-related excess mortality?","abstract":"Introduction\nA major issue raised by the public health consequences of a heat wave is the difficulty of detecting its direct consequences on patient outcome, particularly because of the delay in obtaining definitive mortality results.\n\n Since emergency department (ED) activity reflects the global increase of patients' health problems during this period, the profile of patients referred to EDs might be a basis to detect an excess mortality in the catchment area.\n\n Our objective was to develop a real-time surveillance model based on ED data to detect excessive heat-related mortality as early as possible.\n\n\nMethods\nA day-to-day composite indicator was built using simple and easily obtainable variables related to patients referred to the ED during the 2003 heat-wave period.\n\n The design involved a derivation and validation study based on a real-time surveillance system of two EDs at Cochin Hospital and Hôtel-Dieu Hospital, Paris, France.\n\n The participants were 99,976 adult patients registered from 1 May to 30 September during 2001, 2002 and 2003. Among these participants, 3,297, 3,580 and 3,851 patients were referred to the EDs from 3 August to 19 August for 2001, 2002 and 2003, respectively.\n\n Variables retained for the indicator were selected using the receiver operating characteristic curve methodology and polynomial regression.\n\n\nResults\nThe indicator was composed of only three variables: the percentage of patients older than 70 years, the percentage of patients with body temperature above 39°C, and the percentage of patients admitted to or who died in the ED.\n\n The curve of the indicator with time appropriately fitted the overall mortality that occurred in the region of interest.\n\n\nConclusion\nA composite and simple index based on real-time surveillance was developed according to the profile of patients who visited the ED.\n\n It appeared suitable for determining the overall mortality in the corresponding region submitted to the 2003 heat wave.\n\n This index should help early warning of excessive mortality and monitoring the efficacy of public health interventions.\n\n\n","id":"PMC1794460","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"BioMed Central","authors":[{"firstname":"Yann-Erick","surname":"Claessens","email":"yann-erick.claessens@cch.ap-hop-paris.fr","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Pierre","surname":"Taupin","email":"taupin@necker.fr","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Gérald","surname":"Kierzek","email":"gerald.kierzek@htd.ap-hop-paris.fr","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Jean-Louis","surname":"Pourriat","email":"jlpourriat@invivo.edu","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Michel","surname":"Baud","email":"michel.baud@htd.ap-hop-paris.fr","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Christine","surname":"Ginsburg","email":"christine.ginsburg@cch.ap-hop-paris.fr","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jean-Philippe","surname":"Jais","email":"jais@necker.fr","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Eric","surname":"Jougla","email":"Eric.Jougla@vesinet.inserm.fr","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Bruno","surname":"Riou","email":"bruno.riou@psl.ap-hop-paris.fr","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jean-François","surname":"Dhainaut","email":"president@univ-paris5.fr","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Paul","surname":"Landais","email":"landais@necker.fr","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Mortality and morbidity in Birmingham during the 1976 heatwave","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1093/epirev/mxf007","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Relation between Elevated Ambient Temperature and Mortality: A Review of the Epidemiologic Evidence","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1289/ehp.1205223","date":"2012-10-02","title":"Climate Change and Older Americans: State of the Science","abstract":"Background: Older adults make up 13% of the U.\nS.\n population, but are projected to account for 20% by 2040.

Among people aged over 74 years, daily hospital admissions for disorders of fluid and electrolyte balance, acute renal failure, and heat stroke (grouped in a single nosologic entity, heat diseases, HD), respiratory diseases (RD), circulatory diseases (CD), and a reference category chosen a priori (fractures of the femur, FF) were independently analyzed by Generalized Estimating Equations.\n\n\nResults\nHeatwave duration, not intensity, increased the risk of hospital admissions for HD and RD by, respectively, 16% (p &lt; .\n\n0001) and 5% (p &lt; .\n\n0001) with each additional day of heatwave duration.\n\n At least four consecutive hot humid days were required to observe a major increase in hospital admissions, the excesses being more than twofold for HD (p &lt;

dynamics of the influenza virus, such as time of onset and circulating strains, are well documented by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Influenza Surveillance System, an accurate prediction of timing, magnitude, and composition of circulating strains of seasonal influenza remains elusive.\n\n To facilitate public health preparedness for seasonal influenza and to obtain better insights into the spatiotemporal behavior of emerging strains, it is important to develop measurable characteristics of seasonal oscillation and to quantify the relationships between those parameters on a spatial scale.\n\n The objectives of our research were to examine the seasonality of influenza on a national and state level as well as the relationship between peak timing and intensity of influenza in the United States older adult population.\n\n\nMethodology/Principal Findings\nA total of 248,889 hospitalization records were extracted from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services for the influenza seasons 1991–2004. Harmonic regression models were used to quantify the peak timing and absolute intensity for each of the 48 contiguous states and Washington, DC.\n\n We found that individual influenza seasons showed spatial synchrony with consistent late or early timing occurring across all 48 states during each influenza season in comparison to the overall average.\n\n On a national level, seasons that had an earlier peak also had higher rates of influenza (rs?=??0.5).\n\n We demonstrated a spatial trend in peak timing of influenza; western states such as Nevada, Utah, and California peaked earlier and New England States such as Rhode Island, Maine, and New Hampshire peaked later.\n\n\nConclusions/Significance\nOur findings suggest that a systematic description of influenza seasonal patterns is a valuable tool for disease surveillance and can facilitate strategies for prevention of severe disease in the vulnerable, older adult population.\n\n\n","id":"PMC2855366","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Public Library of Science","authors":[{"firstname":"Julia B.","surname":"Wenger","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Elena N.","surname":"Naumova","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Peter W.","surname":"Gething","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Peter W.","surname":"Gething","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1186/1476-069X-8-40","date":"2009-09-16","title":"High ambient temperature and mortality: a review of epidemiologic studies from 2001 to 2008","abstract":"Background\nThis review examines recent evidence on mortality from elevated ambient temperature for studies published from January 2001 to December 2008.\nMethods\nPubMed was used to search for the following keywords: temperature, apparent temperature, heat, heat index, and mortality.\n\n The search was limited to the English language and epidemiologic studies.\n\n Studies that reported mortality counts or excess deaths following heat waves were excluded so that the focus remained on general ambient temperature and mortality in a variety of locations.\n\n Studies focusing on cold temperature effects were also excluded.\n\n\nResults\nThirty-six total studies were presented in three tables: 1) elevated ambient temperature and mortality; 2) air pollutants as confounders and/or effect modifiers of the elevated ambient temperature and mortality association; and 3) vulnerable subgroups of the elevated ambient temperature-mortality association.\n\n The evidence suggests that particulate matter with less than 10 um in aerodynamic diameter and ozone may confound the association, while ozone was an effect modifier in the warmer months in some locations.\n\n Nonetheless, the independent effect of temperature and mortality was withheld.\n\n Elevated temperature was associated with increased risk for those dying from cardiovascular, respiratory, cerebrovascular, and some specific cardiovascular diseases, such as ischemic heart disease, congestive heart failure, and myocardial infarction.\n\n Vulnerable subgroups also included: Black racial/ethnic group, women, those with lower socioeconomic status, and several age groups, particularly the elderly over 65 years of age as well as infants and young children.\n\n\nConclusion\nMany of these outcomes and vulnerable subgroups have only been identified in recent studies and varied by location and study population.\n\n Thus, region-specific policies, especially in urban areas, are vital to the mitigation of heat-related deaths.\n\n\n","id":"PMC2759912","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"BioMed Central","authors":[{"firstname":"Rupa","surname":"Basu","email":"rbasu@oehha.ca.gov","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"The spectrum of illness during heat waves","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1007/s10393-014-0970-7","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Assessing variability in the impacts of heat on health outcomes in New York City over time, season, and heat-wave duration","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.2105/AJPH.2006.102947","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Projecting Heat-Related Mortality Impacts Under a Changing Climate in the New York City Region","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1186/1476-069x-12-98","date":"2013-10-23","title":"The impact of heat on mortality and morbidity in the Greater Metropolitan Sydney Region: a case crossover analysis","abstract":"Background\nThis study examined the association between unusually high temperature and daily mortality (1997–2007) and hospital admissions (1997–2010) in the Sydney Greater Metropolitan Region (GMR) to assist in the development of targeted health programs designed to minimise the public health impact of extreme heat.\n\n\nMethods\nSydney GMR was categorized into five climate zones.\n\n Heat-events were defined as severe or extreme.\n\n Using a time-stratified case-crossover design with a conditional logistic regression model we adjusted for influenza epidemics, public holidays, and climate zone.\n\n Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals were estimated for associations between daily mortality and hospital admissions with heat-event days compared to non-heat event days for single and three day heat-events.\n\n\nResults\nAll-cause mortality overall had similar magnitude associations with single day and three day extreme and severe events as did all cardiovascular mortality.\n\n Respiratory mortality was associated with single day and three day severe events (95thpercentile, lag0: OR?=?1.14;

Massachusetts Case Study","abstract":"We outline a framework for evaluating food- and water-borne surveillance systems using hospitalization records, and demonstrate the approach using data on salmonellosis, campylobacteriosis and giardiasis in persons aged ?65 years in Massachusetts.\n For each infection, and for each reporting jurisdiction, we generated smoothed standardized morbidity ratios (SMR) and surveillance to hospitalization ratios (SHR) by comparing observed surveillance counts with expected values or the number of hospitalized cases, respectively.\n We examined the spatial distribution of SHR and related this to the mean for the entire state.\n Through this approach municipalities that deviated from the typical experience were identified and suspected of under-reporting.\n Regression analysis revealed that SHR was a significant predictor of SMR, after adjusting for population age-structure.\n This confirms that the spatial “signal” depicted by surveillance is in part influenced by inconsistent testing and reporting practices since municipalities that reported fewer cases relative to the number of hospitalizations had a lower relative risk (as estimated by SMR).\n Periodic assessment of SHR has potential in assessing the performance of surveillance systems.\n","id":"PMC3989214","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Public

hospitalizations from winter migration of older adults: A spatiotemporal analysis","abstract":"Background\nDespite advances in surveillance and prevention, pneumonia and influenza (P&amp;I) remain among the leading causes of mortality in the United States.\n\n Elderly adults experience the most severe morbidity from influenza-associated diseases, and have the highest rates of seasonal migration within the U.\n\nS.\n\n compared to other subpopulations.\n\n The objective of this study is to assess spatiotemporal patterns in influenza-associated hospitalizations in the elderly, by time, geography, and intensity of P&amp;I.\n\n Given the high seasonal migration of individuals to Florida, this state was examined more closely using harmonic regression to assess spatial and temporal patterns of P&amp;I hospitalizations by state of residence.\n\n\nMethods\nData containing all Medicare-eligible hospitalizations in the United States for 1991-2006 with P&amp;I (ICD-9-CM codes 480-487) were abstracted for the 65+ population.\n\n Hospitalizations were classified by state of residence, provider state, and date of admissions, specifically comparing those admitted between October and March to those admitted between April and September.\n\n We then compared the hospitalization profile data of Florida residents with that of out-of-state residents by state of primary residence and time of year (in-season or out-of-season).\n\n\nResults\nWe observed distinct seasonal patterns of nonresident P&amp;I hospitalizations, especially comparing typical winter destination states, such as California, Arizona, Texas, and Florida, to other states.\n\n Although most other states generally experienced a higher proportion of non-resident P&amp;I during the summer months (April-September), these states had higher nonresident P&amp;I during the traditional peak influenza season (October-March).\n\n\nConclusions\nThis study is among the first to quantify spatiotemporal P&amp;I hospitalization patterns in the elderly, focusing on the change of patterns that are possibly due to seasonal population migration.\n\n Understanding migration and influenza-associated disease patterns in this vulnerable population is critical to prepare for and potentially prevent influenza outbreaks in this vulnerable population.\n\n\n","id":"PMC3128025","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"BioMed Central","authors":[{"firstname":"Kenneth

Synchronization of Influenza in the United States Older Adult Population","abstract":"Background\nIn temperate regions, influenza epidemics occur annually with the highest activity occurring during the winter months.\n\n While seasonal dynamics of the influenza virus, such as time of onset and circulating strains, are well documented by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Influenza Surveillance System, an accurate prediction of timing, magnitude, and composition of circulating strains of seasonal influenza remains elusive.\n\n To facilitate public health preparedness for seasonal influenza and to obtain better insights into the spatiotemporal behavior of emerging strains, it is important to develop measurable characteristics of seasonal oscillation and to quantify the relationships between those parameters on a spatial scale.\n\n The objectives of our research were to examine the seasonality of influenza on a national and state level as well as the relationship between peak timing and intensity of influenza in the United States older adult population.\n\n\nMethodology/Principal Findings\nA total of 248,889 hospitalization records were extracted from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services for the influenza seasons 1991–2004. Harmonic regression models were used to quantify the peak timing and absolute intensity for each of the 48 contiguous states and Washington, DC.\n\n We found that individual influenza seasons showed spatial synchrony with consistent late or early timing occurring across all 48 states during each influenza season in comparison to the overall average.\n\n On a national level, seasons that had an earlier peak also had higher rates of influenza (rs?=??0.5).\n\n We demonstrated a spatial trend in peak timing of influenza; western states such as Nevada, Utah, and California peaked earlier and New England States such as Rhode Island, Maine, and New Hampshire peaked later.\n\n\nConclusions/Significance\nOur findings suggest that a systematic description of influenza seasonal patterns is a valuable tool for disease surveillance and can facilitate strategies for prevention of severe disease in the vulnerable, older adult population.\n\n\n","id":"PMC2855366","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Public Library of Science","authors":[{"firstname":"Julia

This is consistent with findings based on self-reported outcomes.\nIntroduction\nFindings from the World Trade Center Health Registry (the Registry), a longitudinal cohort study of persons exposed to the September 11, 2001, World Trade Center disaster (9/11), have provided preliminary evidence of a link between 9/11-related exposures and cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk, and specifically between event-related posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and CVD. High overall levels of 9/11-related exposure were associated with heart disease-related mortality among Registry enrollees who lived, worked, attended school in, or were commuting through the World Trade Center area on 9/11. Among survivors of collapsed buildings, those exposed to the 9/11 dust and debris cloud had an increased risk of self-reported physician-diagnosed stroke. Moreover, measures of dust cloud exposure, injury on 9/11, and event-related PTSD were associated with an elevated risk of self-reported physician-diagnosed heart disease among Registry enrollees 2 to 6 years after the disaster.\nTwo of these studies relied on a self-reported history of CVD. We therefore linked Registry enrollee data with data from the New York State Department of Health's Statewide Planning and Research Cooperative System (SPARCS), a hospitalization discharge-reporting system, to obtain objectively defined CVD end points. We sought to determine whether 9/11-related factors were associated with an increased risk of subsequent CVD hospitalization.\nMethods\nStudy Population\nThe Registry's methods have been described previously. Briefly, rescue/recovery workers and volunteers; lower Manhattan area residents, workers, and school attendees and staff; and commuters or passersby on 9/11 were recruited through building or employee lists or encouraged to enroll via a website or toll-free telephone number. Between September 12, 2003, and November 24, 2004, 71 434 persons completed a telephone (95%) or in-person (5%) enrollment questionnaire on exposures occurring on and after 9/11, sociodemographic factors, and health status. All participants gave verbal informed consent to participate in the Registry. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene institutional review boards approved the Registry protocol.\nProcedures\nThe New York State Department of Health's SPARCS program is an administrative reporting system that records data, including discharge diagnoses and dates, for all patients discharged from acute care hospitals in New York State, excluding psychiatric and federal hospitals. SPARCS data have been used for health research in the past, including studies of CVD hospitalizations.\nPersonal identifying data for Registry enrollees were electronically linked to SPARCS records from January 1, 2000, through December 31, 2010. Records that matched on parts of key identifying information, such as name, date of birth, Social Security number, or address, were considered matches. Deaths were identified through data linkages to New York City vital records (through December 31, 2010) and the National Death Index (through December 31, 2008), as described previously.\nCVD Outcomes\nWe defined cardiovascular hospitalizations based on International Classification of Disease, 9th Revision (ICD-9) codes for the principal discharge diagnosis. CVD hospitalizations were categorized as either heart disease or cerebrovascular disease hospitalizations. Heart disease hospitalizations included those for hypertension (ICD codes 401 to 405), acute coronary artery disease (410, 411), chronic coronary artery disease (412 to 414), dysrhythmia (427), and congestive heart failure (428). We also studied a more narrowly defined subset of these outcomes, coronary artery disease hospitalizations (ICD codes 410 to 414). Cerebrovascular disease was defined as ICD codes 430 to 438.\nExposure Assessment\nBecause objective measures of 9/11-related exposures are not available for most persons exposed to the disaster, we defined exposure based on responses to the enrollment questionnaire, as summarized in Table 1. Dust cloud exposure was defined as answering &quot;yes&quot; to having been caught in the dust and debris cloud on 9/11. Injury was defined as reporting any of the following: eye injury or irritation; cut, abrasion, or puncture wound; sprain or strain; burn; broken or dislocated bone; or concussion or head injury. Rescue/recovery workers were asked questions about arrival time, location, type, and duration of work. Area residents and workers were asked about evacuation of their homes and workplaces. Because enrollees were queried about many different but overlapping exposures, we summarized the overall level of 9/11-related exposure as high, intermediate, or low, separately for rescue/recovery and nonrescue/recovery enrollees, as described previously.\nDefinitions of Overall Levels of Exposure to the World Trade Center Disaster and Its Aftermath\nRescue/recovery workers	 	  High:Was present in Manhattan south of Chambers Street between the time of the first plane impact and noon on 9/11 (encompassing the WTC towers' collapse) and at least one of the following:	 	  Worked on the dust and debris pile on 9/11 and/or	 	  Worked for &gt;90 days starting before September 18, 2001	 	  Low:Met all of the following conditions	 	  Began work on or after September 18, 2001, and	 	  Did not work on pile and	 	  Worked fewer than 30 days and	 	  Was not present south of Chambers Street between the first plane impact and noon on 9/11	 	  Intermediate:Neither high nor low	 	Residents of lower Manhattan, area workers, and commuters or passersby on 9/11.	 	  High:Reported at least two 9/11-related injuries and, if a lower Manhattan resident, did not evacuate home	 	  Low:Reported no injuries related to 9/11 and, if a lower Manhattan resident, also evacuated home	 	  Intermediate:Neither high nor low	 	\nWTC indicates World Trade Center.\nAdditional Study Variables\nStudy participants were hierarchically categorized as rescue/recovery workers (including volunteers) or nonrescue/recovery workers (including lower Manhattan area residents or workers and passersby or commuters). A history of self-reported, physician-diagnosed hypertension or diabetes was obtained from the enrollment questionnaire. Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) was assessed with the PTSD Checklist (PCL), a validated, 17-item scale that inquired about 9/11-specific psychological symptoms within the 30 days preceding the enrollment questionnaire. We used a score &gt;=44 to define probable PTSD, which we subsequently refer to as PTSD for simplicity. If an enrollee was missing responses to PCL items but had a score from the remaining items that could only be compatible with a total score of less than or &gt;=44, he or she was categorized accordingly. Otherwise, PTSD was considered missing.\nStatistical Analysis\nThe observation period began at Registry enrollment and ended at the first cerebrovascular or heart disease hospitalization, death, or December 31, 2010, whichever was earliest. The analysis was limited to enrollees who lived in New York State on Registry enrollment (54 650, 76.5%) because SPARCS reflects only New York State hospitalizations. Participants who reported a history of stroke or heart disease before Registry enrollment (n=4443) or with a preenrollment cardiovascular or cerebrovascular disease hospitalization (n=338) were excluded. We also excluded enrollees who withdrew from the Registry (n=470), who were &lt;18 years old on 9/11 (n=2740) or had missing age data (n=242), or were lower Manhattan area school students or staff but did not belong to other eligibility groups (n=71), due to small numbers. Enrollees with a first cerebrovascular disease hospitalization during the study period were excluded from analyses of heart disease hospitalizations, and vice versa. We stratified the analysis on sex due to well-established differences in cardiovascular risk profiles for men and women.\nProportional hazards regression models were used to examine associations of 9/11-related exposures and PTSD with heart disease and cerebrovascular hospitalizations accounting for factors that were theoretically and statistically associated with the outcomes in bivariate analysis: age, race/ethnicity, education, smoking, history of hypertension, and history of diabetes. We evaluated linear trends in the hazards ratios by including each exposure as a continuous variable in a multivariable analysis and testing whether its coefficient differed significantly from zero. The low, intermediate, and high levels were assigned values of 1, 2, and 3, respectively. The assumption of proportional hazards over time was tested for all models presented by using time-dependent variables to assess interactions between each predictor of interest and a function of survival time and by using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test.\nWe considered P-values &lt;0.05 or CIs that did not include 1 to be statistically significant. Analyses used SAS version 9.2 (SAS Institute Inc).\nResults\nTable 2 shows characteristics of the study group. Mean age on 9/11 was 41.6 years for women and 40.7 years for men. Compared with women, a higher proportion of men were non-Hispanic white. A higher proportion of women were college graduates. Twenty-two percent of women and 15% of men screened positive for PTSD at study enrollment. Among rescue/recovery enrollees, a larger proportion of men had a high overall level of 9/11-related exposure.\nCharacteristics of Study Participants*\n	Women (n=18 679), %	Men (n=27 667), %	 	Age on September 11, 2001, y	 	&lt;25	8.1	5.4	 	25 to 44	51.5	60.8	 	45 to 64	36.6	31.7	 	65+	3.8	2.1	 	Race/ethnicity	 	Non-Hispanic white	49.4	66.6	 	Non-Hispanic black	20.1	9.8	 	Hispanic	16.1	13.7	 	Asian	9.3	6.2	 	Other/multiracial	5.0	3.8	 	Education	 	Less than high school	5.2	6.0	 	High school	16.7	22.0	 	Some college	22.9	26.1	 	College graduate	53.5	44.5	 	Marital status	 	Married	38.5	63.0	 	Widowed/divorced/separated	21.3	9.8	 	Never married	30.3	18.8	 	Living with a partner	7.9	6.9	 	Smoking history	 	Never	58.8	54.3	 	Current	15.7	17.9	 	Former	24.1	26.5	 	History of hypertension	 	Yes	15.3	15.6	 	No	84.2	83.9	 	History of diabetes	 	Yes	4.0	4.0	 	No	95.6	95.6	 	9/11 dust cloud exposure	 	Yes	59.8	53.1	 	No	39.7	46.5	 	Injured on 9/11*	 	Yes	40.9	42.1	 	No	59.1	57.9	 	PTSD at enrollment	 	Yes	21.6	14.7	 	No	77.0	84.0	 	Rescue/recovery workers/volunteers	n=3634	n=16 137	 	Overall level of exposure*	 	Low	16.7	4.3	 	Intermediate	73.6	77.1	 	High	5.5	15.7	 	Nonrescue/recovery participants	n=15 045	n=11 530	 	Overall level of exposure*	 	Low	48.5	54.6	 	Intermediate	41.4	37.5	 	High	8.7	6.9	 	\nPTSD indicates posttraumatic stress disorder.\nPercentages may not sum to 100 due to missing values.\nInjury was defined as reporting any of the following: eye injury or irritation; cut, abrasion, or puncture wound; sprain or strain; burn; broken or dislocated bone; or concussion or head injury.\nPlease see Table 1 for definition of exposure levels.\nWe identified 1151 heart disease and 284 cerebrovascular hospitalizations from the SPARCS system during 302 742 person-years of observation (mean follow-up, 6.5 years per person). The most common heart disease admissions were for coronary atherosclerosis (ICD-9 codes 411 [n=62], 413 [n=16], and 414 [n=401]), dysrhythmia (ICD-9 code 427, n=269), and acute myocardial infarction (ICD-9 code 410, n=223). Most cerebrovascular hospitalizations were for acute cerebrovascular disease (ICD-9 codes 430 to 434, n=145) or transient ischemic attacks (ICD-9 code 435, n=100).\nHeart Disease Hospitalizations\nTable 3 shows multivariable adjusted hazard ratios (AHRs) for relationships between 9/11-related exposures and PTSD and heart disease hospitalization. Accounting for other factors, women with PTSD at enrollment had an elevated risk of heart disease hospitalization (AHR 1.32, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.71). Among men, this relationship did not reach statistical significance (AHR 1.16, 95% CI 0.97 to 1.40). Male rescue/recovery workers with a high overall level of 9/11-related exposure were at an 82% higher risk of heart disease hospitalization compared with those with a low level of exposure (P for trend 0.05). The hazard ratios for female rescue/recovery workers with high or intermediate levels of exposure were also elevated, but this was not statistically significant (P for trend 0.09).\nSex-Specific Associations of 9/11-Related Exposures and PTSD With Heart Disease Hospitalization Among Participants in the World Trade Center Health Registry residing in New York State, 2003-2010\n	Women (n=18 551)	Men (n=27 511)	 	Number of Events*	Person-Years	AHR	95% CI	Number of Events*	Person-Years	AHR	95% CI	 	9/11 Dust cloud exposure	 	Yes	178	73 826	0.96	0.75 to 1.22	450	95 219	0.96	0.84 to 1.11	 	No	118	48 488	Ref.		402	82 794	Ref.

We also found an association between PTSD and cerebrovascular disease hospitalization among male enrollees. Additionally, male rescue/recovery enrollees with a high overall level of 9/11-related exposure were at a higher risk of heart disease hospitalization compared with those with a low level of exposure. While the AHRs for these associations were not statistically significant for both men and women, the hazard ratios were of similar magnitude for the 2 sexes, suggesting that the associations identified may exist for both, although our study may be underpowered to detect this. These results, based on objectively defined cardiovascular end points, suggest that persons with 9/11-related PTSD and those who performed intensive rescue/recovery work may be at an elevated risk of chronic CVD.\nA growing body of literature, including prospective studies of well-defined cardiovascular end points such as mortality, links PTSD to CVD in both military and civilian populations. A number of feasible explanations for this association have been proposed, including chronic dysregulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and autonomic nervous system leading to long-term physiological changes that promote atherosclerosis. Adverse effects of PTSD on blood pressure and lipid metabolism have been reported, each of which could play an important role in the causal pathway. Behaviors associated with PTSD, such as smoking and alcohol consumption, may also contribute. Studies of PTSD and cerebrovascular disease, although fewer, also support a potential link. Since PTSD is 1 of the most commonly reported 9/11-related health outcomes, it could have a considerable influence on CVD risk in this population.\nIn contrast to results of our previous study of self-reported heart disease in this cohort, we did not identify an association between measures of dust cloud exposure or injury on 9/11 and heart disease hospitalization. It is possible that our analysis of hospitalized cases was underpowered to detect this relationship, whereas the larger number of self-reported cases enabled us to identify such an association. It is also possible that a relationship exists between these 9/11-related exposures and milder manifestations of CVD, as reflected in self-reported heart disease, but not between 9/11-related exposures and more severe CVD that would tend to result in hospitalization. Additional years of study may help clarify the nature of the relationship between 9/11-related exposures and chronic CVD risk.\nAlthough this study builds on our previous work by using a more objective case definition, our findings remain limited by a lack of information on several CVD risk factors, including family history and dyslipidemia. The Registry has begun collecting data on hypercholesterolemia and body mass index among its enrollees, which will enable future studies to incorporate this information. However, epidemiological studies based on in-depth clinical examination may be needed to further clarify the relation of 9/11-related exposures and PTSD to heart disease and stroke, fully accounting for factors such as family history, physical activity level, and metabolic markers of cardiovascular risk factors. An additional limitation is potential underascertainment of hospitalizations among study participants, since personal identifying data used in the data linkage were incomplete for some Registry enrollees; SPARCS does not include federal or psychiatric hospitals; and study participants may have been hospitalized outside of New York State during the study period, which would not be reflected in SPARCS. This may have diminished the power of our study. Furthermore, our study did not determine whether PTSD was part of the causal pathway between 9/11-related environmental exposures and CVD hospitalizations or whether PTSD and rescue/recovery-related exposures were independent risk factors; we hope to explore this further when additional years of observation are available for study.\nLimitations notwithstanding, these results are consistent with our previous finding of an association of 9/11-related exposures and PTSD with CVD, and with a larger body of literature that has established environmental and psychological stressors as CVD risk factors. Our results suggest that medical follow-up of persons who performed intensive rescue/recovery work in response to the disaster or developed 9/11-related PTSD should include screening for modifiable CVD risk factors, including smoking, hypertension, and dyslipidemia.\nSources of Funding\nThis publication was supported by Cooperative Agreement numbers 2U50OH009739 and 1U50OH009739 from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)-National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, and U50/ATU272750 from CDC-Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry which included support from CDC-National Center for Environmental Health, and the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene.

of adult-onset asthma incidence among HMO members","abstract":"Background\nHMO databases offer an opportunity for community based epidemiologic studies of asthma incidence, etiology and treatment.\n\n The incidence of asthma in HMO populations and the utility of HMO data, including use of computerized algorithms and manual review of medical charts for determining etiologic factors has not been fully explored.\n\n\nMethods\nWe identified adult-onset asthma, using computerized record searches in a New England HMO.\n\n Monthly, our software applied exclusion and inclusion criteria to identify an 'at-risk' population and 'potential cases'.\n\n Electronic and paper medical records from the past year were then reviewed for each potential case.\n\n Persons with other respiratory diseases or insignificant treatment for asthma were excluded.\n\n\nResults\nThe algorithm was 93 to 99.3% sensitive and 99.6% specific.\n\n Sixty-three percent (n = 469) of potential cases were confirmed as AOA.\n\n Two thirds of confirmed cases were women with an average age of 34.8 (SD 11.8), and 45% had no evidence of previous asthma diagnosis.\n\n The annualized monthly rate of AOA ranged from 4.1 to 11.4 per 1000 at-risk members.\n\n Physicians most commonly attribute asthma to infection (59%) and allergy (14%).\n\n New-onset cases were more likely attributed to infection, while reactivated cases were more associated with allergies.\n\n Medical charts included a discussion of work exposures in relation to asthma in only 32 (7%) cases.\n\n Twenty-three of these (72%) indicated there was an association between asthma and workplace exposures for an overall rate of work-related asthma of 4.9%.\n\n\nConclusion\nComputerized HMO records can be successfully used to identify AOA.\n\n Manual review of these records is important to confirm case status and is useful in evaluation of provider consideration of etiologies.\n\n We demonstrated that clinicians attribute most AOA to infection and tend to ignore the contribution of environmental and occupational exposures.\n\n\n","id":"PMC194432","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"BioMed Central","authors":[{"firstname":"Susan

neurobiological and behavioral systems - impeding not only research on etiology and pathophysiology but also the development of new treatments.\n\n\nDiscussion\nThe National Institute of Mental Health began the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) project in 2009 to develop a research classification system for mental disorders based upon dimensions of neurobiology and observable behavior.\n\n RDoC supports research to explicate fundamental biobehavioral dimensions that cut across current heterogeneous disorder categories.\n\n We summarize the rationale, status and long-term goals of RDoC, outline challenges in developing a research classification system (such as construct validity and a suitable process for updating the framework) and discuss seven distinct differences in conception and emphasis from current psychiatric nosologies.\n\n\nSummary\nFuture diagnostic systems cannot reflect ongoing advances in genetics, neuroscience and cognitive science until a literature organized around these disciplines is available to inform the revision efforts.\n\n The goal of the RDoC project is to provide a framework for research to transform the approach to the nosology of mental disorders.\n\n\n","id":"PMC3653747","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"BioMed Central","authors":[{"firstname":"Bruce

Attack: A Meta-Analytic Review","abstract":"Background and Purpose\nPosttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is common in survivors of acute life-threatening illness, but little is known about the burden of PTSD in survivors of stroke and transient ischemic attack (TIA).\n\n This study estimated the prevalence of stroke or TIA-induced posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) using systematic review and meta-analysis.\n\n\nMethods\nPotentially relevant peer-reviewed journal articles were identified by searching the Ovid MEDLINE, PsycINFO, PILOTS Database, The Cochrane Library and Scopus from inception to January 2013; all searches were conducted on January 31, 2013. Observational cohort studies that assessed PTSD with specific reference to a stroke or TIA that occurred at least 1 month prior to the PTSD assessment were included.\n\n PTSD rates and characteristics of the study and sample were abstracted from all included studies.\n\n The coding of all articles included demographics, sample size, study country, and method and timing of PTSD assessment.\n\n\nResults\nNine studies (N?=?1,138) met our inclusion criteria.\n\n PTSD rates varied significantly across studies by timing of PTSD assessment (i.\n\ne.\n\n, within 1 year of stroke/TIA versus greater than 1 year post-stroke/TIA; 55% of heterogeneity explained; Q\n1?=?10.30; P?=?.\n\n001).\n\n Using a random effects model, the estimated rate of PTSD following stroke or TIA was 23% (95% CI, 16%–33%) within 1 year of the stroke or TIA and 11% (95% CI, 8%–14%) after 1 year.\n\n\nConclusions\nAlthough PTSD is commonly thought to be triggered by external events such as combat or sexual assault, these results suggest that 1 in 4 stroke or TIA survivors develop significant PTSD symptoms due to the stroke or TIA.\n\n Screening for PTSD in a large population-based prospective cohort study with cardiovascular outcome assessments is needed to yield definitive prevalence, and determine whether stroke or TIA-induced PTSD is a risk factor for subsequent cardiovascular events or mortality.\n\n\n","id":"PMC3686746","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Public Library of

cardiovascular disease and mortality; however, the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood.\n\n We hypothesized that patients with PTSD would exhibit endothelial dysfunction, a potential mechanism involved in the development and progression of cardiovascular disease.\n\n\nMethods and Results\nA total of 214 outpatients treated at the San Francisco Veterans Affairs Medical Center underwent tests of endothelial function and evaluation for PTSD.\n\n Flow?mediated vasodilation of the brachial artery was performed to assess endothelial function, and current PTSD status was defined by the PTSD Checklist, based on the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (Fourth Edition), with a score ?40. Multivariable linear regression models were used to estimate the association between PTSD status and endothelial function.\n\n Patients with PTSD (n=67) were more likely to be male (99% versus 91%, P=0.04) and to have depression (58% versus 8%, P&lt;0.0001) and were less likely to be on an angiotensin?converting enzyme inhibitor (17% versus 36%, P=0.007) or ??blocker treatment (25% versus 41%, P=0.03).\n\n Univariate analysis demonstrated that patients with PTSD had significantly lower flow?mediated vasodilation (5.8±3.4% versus 7.5±3.7%; P=0.003); furthermore, lower flow?mediated vasodilation was associated with increasing age (P=0.008), decreasing estimated glomerular filtration rate (P=0.003), hypertension (P=0.002), aspirin (P=0.03), and ??blocker treatments (P=0.01).\n\n In multivariable analysis, PTSD remained independently associated with lower flow?mediated vasodilation (P=0.0005).\n\n\nConclusions\nAfter adjusting for demographic, comorbidity, and treatment characteristics, PTSD remained associated with worse endothelial function in an outpatient population.\n\n Whether poor endothelial function contributes to the higher risk of cardiovascular disease in patients with PTSD deserves further study.\n\n\n","id":"PMC4943274","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"John Wiley and Sons Inc.","authors":[{"firstname":"S.

significant by Fisher's Exact Test (P = 3 × 10?54).\n We also find 15 PTSD risk genes that are independently associated with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM; also significant by Fisher's Exact Test (P

cardiovascular disease (CVD).\n\n Biopsychosocial factors associated with PTSD likely account for some or all of this association.\n\n We determined whether 1, or a combination of comorbid conditions explained the association between PTSD and incident CVD.\n\n\nMethods and Results\nEligible patients used 1 of 5 Veterans Health Affairs medical centers distributed across the United States.\n\n Data were obtained from electronic health records.\n\n At index date, 2519 Veterans Health Affairs (VA) patients, 30 to 70 years of age, had PTSD diagnoses and 1659 did not.\n\n Patients had no CVD diagnoses for 12 months before index date.\n\n Patients could enter the cohort between 2008 and 2012 with follow?up until 2015. Age?adjusted Cox proportional hazard models were computed before and after adjusting for comorbidities.\n\n Patients were middle aged (mean=50.1 years, SD±11.0), mostly male (87.0%), and 60% were white.\n\n The age?adjusted association between PTSD and incident CVD was significant (hazard ratio=1.41; 95% CI: 1.21–1.63).\n\n After adjustment for metabolic conditions, the association between PTSD and incident CVD was attenuated but remained significant (hazard ratio=1.23; 95% CI: 1.06–1.44).\n\n After additional adjustment for smoking, sleep disorder, substance use disorder, anxiety disorders, and depression, PTSD was not associated with incident CVD (hazard ratio=0.96; 95% CI: 0.81–1.15).\n\n\nConclusions\n\nPTSD is not an independent risk factor for CVD.\n\n Physical and psychiatric conditions and smoking that co?occur with PTSD explain why this patient population has an increased risk of CVD.\n\n Careful monitoring may limit exposure to CVD risk factors and subsequent incident CVD.\n\n\n","id":"PMC6405681","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"John Wiley and Sons Inc.","authors":[{"firstname":"Jeffrey F.","surname":"Scherrer","email":"scherrjf@slu.edu","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Joanne","surname":"Salas","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Beth E.","surname":"Cohen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Paula P.","surname":"Schnurr","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"F.

psychological treatments for PTSD exist.\n In 2017, the Veterans Health Administration and Department of Defense (VA/DoD) and the American Psychological Association (APA) each published treatment guidelines for PTSD, which are a set of recommendations for providers who treat individuals with PTSD.\n The purpose of the current review article is to briefly review the methodology used in each set of 2017 guidelines and then discuss the psychological treatments of PTSD for adults that were strongly recommended by both sets of guidelines.\n Both guidelines strongly recommended use of Prolonged Exposure (PE), Cognitive Processing Therapy (CPT) and trauma-focused Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT).\n Each of these treatments has a large evidence base and is trauma-focused, which means they directly address memories of the traumatic event or thoughts and feelings related to the traumatic event.\n Finally, we will discuss implications and future

These effects may have a lasting impact on both health and economic implications.\nHurricane Katrina struck New Orleans in August 2005. Although the economic and environmental devastation caused by the hurricane is well known and the short-term impact on health care and health care delivery has been well described, the impact on chronic disease has not been well documented. Our personal experience and anecdotal information suggest that individuals with diabetes were very seriously affected owing to the lack of medical care, appropriate food, and medications. Diabetes is a chronic disease with many comorbidities, including hypertension and lipid abnormalities. Disruption of health care provisions and medications is likely to have both a short-term and long-term impact on this condition. We tested the following hypotheses: 1) Hurricane Katrina has had a significant impact on the health of individuals with diabetes; 2) this impact will have long-lasting health and economic implications; and 3) preexisting disparities between health systems will be worsened and lead to further disparity in health status.\nRESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS\nThis study was approved by the Tulane Human Research Advisory Committee. The collection of data were considered to be exempt from needing informed consent.\nStudy population\nPrivate hospital and clinic (Tulane University Hospital and Clinic [TUHC]). TUHC reopened clinics in January 2006. However, clinics, including a diabetes clinic, reopened within a few weeks at nearby undamaged Tulane University partner hospitals. Thus, private patients (usually with health insurance) had access to a diabetes center within a few weeks after the hurricane.\nSoutheast Louisiana Veterans Health Care System (VA), a system available almost exclusively to veterans. The VA hospital reopened outpatient primary care clinics in New Orleans 3 months and specialty clinics 5 months after the hurricane. In addition, veterans had access to VA services and medications in other parts of the state and country.\nThe Medical Center of Louisiana at New Orleans (MCLNO), &quot;Louisiana Charity System.&quot; This state-funded system provides acute and chronic care for all patients irrespective of insurance status, with a significant proportion of uninsured patients: MCLNO specialty clinics were closed for &gt;1 year after the hurricane. However, primary care was available at a variety of community clinics, with fragmented health care services. No diabetes-specific specialty clinic was available for these patients for ~1 year.\nTulane University Health Sciences Center is a major provider of health care in the city of New Orleans and has established long-standing diabetes care centers within three health care systems with the patients grouped accordingly: \nThe characteristics of the patients studied are summarized in Table 1. We believe that this information reflects reasonably accurately the characteristics of the patients with diabetes in each system. There are no major differences among the provider characteristics in the three systems, with many providers working in more than one system.\nCharacteristics of the study population\n	Total	TUHC/private	VA	MCLNO/public	P	 	n	1,795	452	748	595		 	Age (years)	61.9 +- 11.6	58.6 +- 13.5	66.4 +- 10.5	58.7 +- 9.2	&lt;0.0001	 	Sex (male)	61.2	44.9	96.9	28.7	&lt;0.0001	 	Race						 	    Caucasian	39.3	44.9	55.1	15.1	&lt;0.0001	 	    African American	56.9	51.3	40.2	82	&lt;0.0001	 	    Other	3.8	3.8	4.7	2.9	&lt;0.0001	 	\nData are means +- SD or %.\nAdults with diabetes and an A1C measurement 6 months before Hurricane Katrina (28 February 2005-27 August 2005) and 6-16 months after Hurricane Katrina (1 March 2006-31 December 2006) were identified from databases within these three health care systems. All patients seen at TUHC and MCLNO who had such measurements were included in the study population. Because there were considerably more such patients in the VA system, we randomly selected 750 patients for this study, among whom 748 had data available for all study-related parameters. After identification of these patients, their other laboratory parameters (lipids) were obtained and their charts were reviewed for blood pressure measurements that occurred within the study time period.\nWe compared the level of glycemic control (A1C), blood pressure, and lipids in patients for whom data were available in the 6-month period before the hurricane with levels after resumption of clinical activities (1 March 2006-31 December 2006). No specific intervention or recommendations were made. In patients who had multiple measurements of A1C, blood pressure, or lipids, the values at the last visit of the pre-Katrina period and the first visit of the post-Katrina period were included in final analysis.\nData sources\nLaboratory data at all three institutions were computerized and were available for both time periods. TUHC used a computerized medical record for all laboratory data and some clinical data. Medical records for most patients previously seen at TUHC were intact. All laboratory and clinical data at the VA were electronically available. Laboratory records at MCLNO were computerized, but data on blood pressure were only available for a subset of patients, whose clinic records were salvaged.\nStatistical analysis\nPrimary outcomes were A1C, systolic and diastolic blood pressures, and lipids. We were interested in the changes in these parameters before and after Hurricane Katrina and whether these changes were consistent across the three health care systems. Paired sample t tests were performed for pre- and post-Katrina mean values of A1C, blood pressure, and lipids within each system. One-way ANOVA with a post hoc Bonferroni correction was used to determine whether the above-mentioned pre- and post-Katrina measurements differed among the three systems.\nLinear regression models were also fitted for the changes in the three primary outcomes. Changes in A1C, blood pressure, and lipids were calculated by subtracting pre-Katrina values from post-Katrina values. These changes were used as dependent variables. Covariates included in the models were health care system, patients' age in August 2005, sex, and &quot;time gap.&quot; Time gap was defined as the number of months between the pre- and post-Katrina measurements. Because patients did not necessarily have parameters measured on the same day, the time gaps for different outcomes could be different for each patient. These analyses were performed in SAS (version 9.1.3 for Windows, 2005; SAS Institute, Cary, NC).\nModeling for possible long-term outcomes was performed using the CORE Diabetes Model (CDM), a documented, validated simulation model for type 2 diabetes that projects life expectancy, quality-adjusted life expectancy (QALE) and total lifetime costs of diabetes-related complications. The transition probabilities using the UK Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS) studies, U.S. costs of complications, and health state utilities were detailed in the previous publication. For instance, the underlying assumption for A1C changes based on the UKPDS cohort was a linear decay at a rate of 0.15%/year until the end of 7 years, with the decay leveling off for the rest of lifetime. The model is a multilayer Internet application using SQL and C++ programming languages and a user interface to enter customized settings of the results from the tests described above to specifically define an analysis and output the results. For this study, the simulations were run over a lifetime horizon in accordance with the current guidelines that recommend time horizons be sufficient to capture the development of all relevant complications. Specifically, this model estimates lifetime survival and costs for those who survived the hurricane and may have experienced disruption of treatment or deprivation of insulin and other medication over a period of time.\nWe ran the CDM for each of the three health care system populations. The mean changes in A1C, blood pressure, and lipids generated by the analyses of data before and 6-16 months after Hurricane Katrina among the study populations were populated into the input databases of the CDM. In addition, the SDs around the mean changes were also included to account for the uncertainty around the effects on glycemic control. Demographic information such as age, race, and sex for the study sample was used, whereas weight and smoking status used for the model were the CDM default values (i.e., the U.S. prevalence of smoking status and body weight distribution). The CDM has 16 submodels that run in parallel for which 1,000 patients are run through the model 1,000 times to account both for patient level uncertainty and parameter level uncertainty for model inputs. The output via user interface provided a set of results (pre-Katrina and 6-16 months post-Katrina) from each set of simulations. These pre/post differences in the estimates from the 1,000 iterations, which measured the impact of Hurricane Katrina, were used to derive mean and SEM of life expectancy and QALE, as well as total cumulative direct, indirect, and combined costs (direct + indirect) over a lifetime. The individual patient's impact within each health system was tested for statistical inference using one-sample t tests. We further extrapolated the prevalence-based mean impact of an individual patient to the entire population in the greater New Orleans area using 2000 U.S. Census data. The following assumptions based on the Louisiana Department of Health and Hospital statistics report 2006 were made: MCLNO represented 20% of the population, VA represented 5%, and TUHC/privately insured represented 75%; the adult population affected in the greater New Orleans area was 964,677 adults; and an estimated diabetes prevalence of 9.2% obtained from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (http://apps.nccd.cdc.gov/brfss/) was used. Because of the methodological difficulty to produce a population SD from three sample SDs, a sensitivity analysis on lifetime costs was performed by varying 10% on sample mean costs.\nRESULTS\nA total of 1,795 patients with A1C measurements in the 6 months before Hurricane Katrina and the 6-16 months after the hurricane were included. Among them, 748 were VA patients, 595 were MCLNO patients, and 452 were TUHC patients. The mean age of all patients was 61.9 years and 61.2% were male. The MCLNO system consisted of &gt;80% African American patients. The percentage of male patients (96.9%) was higher in the VA system compared with those in the TUHC and MCLNO systems (44.9 and 28.7%, respectively).\nThe impact of the disaster on clinical and laboratory parameters is summarized in Table 2. Mean A1C values increased significantly over the study period among the patients of the MCLNO system (P &lt; 0.001); however, pre-Katrina A1C levels were similar to post-Katrina levels among patients of the VA and TUHC systems (P = 0.214 and P = 0.108, respectively). Mean pre-Katrina A1C levels significantly differed between MCLNO and VA patients (P &lt; 0.001). Mean post-Katrina A1C values also significantly differed between the MCLNO and the other two systems (P &lt; 0.001). Mean systolic blood pressures increased among all three systems (P &lt; 0.001 for TUHC and VA; P = 0.008 for MCLNO). Mean pre-Katrina systolic blood pressures did not differ significantly among the three systems, whereas mean post-Katrina systolic blood pressure was significantly higher in the VA patients compared with patients in the other two systems (P &lt; 0.001).

The magnitude of the impact for each health care system was consistent with that of the clinical results. The largest economic impact was seen in MCLNO patients with $5,243 over their lifetime, followed by VA patients ($3,907), and privately insured TUHC patients ($2,270). Despite the fact that the impact on life expectancy seemed to be small (MCLNO patients -0.301 years, VA patients -0.264 years, and TUHC patients -0.078 years), the economic impact was quite substantial because of the large size of the population affected by Hurricane Katrina. Assuming that the adult prevalence of diabetes in the affected area was 9.2% (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimate in an adult population of approximately 1.0 million, 2000 U.S. Census data), we estimated a lifetime cost of USD $504 million for the population affected by Hurricane Katrina. A 10% variation around the mean cost of each sample produced an estimate of lifetime costs of USD $454-$555 million due to the impact of Hurricane Katrina.\nCDM estimates of changes in life expectancy and health care costs per patient related to Hurricane Katrina\n	Effect	SD	P	Extrapolated cost (US$)* 	-10% variation (US$)	+10% variation (US$)	 	MCLNO (20%)							 	    Life expectancy (year)	-0.301	0.552	&lt;0.0001				 	    QALE	-0.242	0.431	&lt;0.0001				 	    Direct cost	3,502	6,391	&lt;0.0001	62,160,699	55,944,629	68,376,769	 	    Indirect cost	1,741	3,250	&lt;0.0001	30,902,849	27,812,564	33,993,134	 	    Total cost	5,243	8,664	&lt;0.0001	93,063,548	83,757,193	102,369,903	 	TUHC (75%)							 	    Life expectancy (year)	-0.078	0.455	&lt;0.0001				 	    QALE	-0.07	0.354	&lt;0.0001				 	    Direct cost	1,840	5,354	&lt;0.0001	122,475,392	110,227,853	134,722,931	 	    Indirect cost	430	2,682	&lt;0.0001	28,621,967	25,759,770	31,484,163	 	    Total cost	2,270	6,927	&lt;0.0001	151,097,359	135,987,623	166,207,094	 	VA (5%)							 	    Life expectancy (year)	-0.264	0.483	&lt;0.0001				 	    QALE	-1.208	0.371	&lt;0.0001				 	    Direct cost	2,683	5,423	&lt;0.0001	178,587,759	160,728,983	196,446,535	 	    Indirect cost	1,224	2,850	&lt;0.0001	81,472,761	73,325,485	89,620,037	 	    Total cost	3,907	7,201	&lt;0.0001	260,060,520	234,054,468	286,066,572	 	    Population cost				504,221,426	453,799,283	554,643,569	 	\n*Adult population (age &gt;=18 years): 964,677, estimated for greater New Orleans of seven parishes affected by Hurricane Katrina (Orleans Parish, Jefferson Parish, St. Bernard Parish, St. Tammany Parish, Plaquemines Parish, St. Charles Parish, and St. John the Baptist Parish), Louisiana.

Furthermore, disparities in health, related to socioeconomic status that existed before the disaster, have been exacerbated, with potential long-term consequences.\nVery few studies have been carried out on the effect of major disasters on diabetes and its comorbidities. Published data includes reports on hurricanes within the U.S., but these have been relatively small and short-term studies. Studies in Japan after major earthquakes have demonstrated an increase in stress associated with poor glycemic control for up to 1 year. High scores on a questionnaire regarding property damage, injuries, and mortality among relatives were taken to indicate increased psychological stresses from the survivors and were associated with increased A1C. Similar effects have been reported with hypertension, with ambulatory blood pressure revealing that sympathetic activation is an important component of rising blood pressure after life-threatening events and may trigger myocardial infarction. For example, the war in Croatia led to prolonged stress, impacting cortisol levels and loss of metabolic control in individuals with type 2 diabetes.\nPatients most severely affected by Hurricane Katrina may have been unable to return to the New Orleans area. However, in systems such as the VA, it is possible to monitor patients pre- and postevent, as they may have been seen in other VA facilities. Unfortunately, in the other systems we were limited to including only those who returned and also had intact predisaster records. Thus, our findings are a conservative estimate of the impact and are likely to not reflect the worst case scenarios (e.g., patients who died or those most seriously affected financially, making return impossible). Our findings can only be extrapolated to the impact on individuals who survive a disaster and who remain/return to the same geographical area.\nWe have also demonstrated a difference in the time course of these changes in cardiovascular risk factors. For example, blood pressure was highest very shortly after the disaster and gradually declined with time. In contrast, the reverse occurred with A1C, which is not surprising, given that A1C reflects a much longer time period and is more stable than blood pressure. A short and sharp rise in blood pressure has previously been documented in short-term studies after other natural disasters, whereas A1C has not been previously tested in such studies.\nOur study also demonstrates significant reduction in life expectancy and QALE in all three patient populations. Even though the increase in advance events was not measured in the study, the overall modeled reduction in life expectancy should result from myocardial infarction or cardiovascular diseases, rather than end-stage renal disease, particularly in the setting of a large elevation of blood pressure. Furthermore, these data demonstrate that the disaster led to an increase in lifetime costs related to health care in all three systems.\nIn diabetes, several simulation models have been used to describe disease progression and estimate the cost effectiveness of interventions. Because they are not statements of scientific fact, simulation models may be used to make inferences about future economic, quality-of-life, and health outcomes to provide data for decision making. This advantage is particularly important when an empirical study is logistically infeasible. In the care for diabetes, the health consequences of changes in A1C, lipids, and blood pressure on long-term outcomes in type 2 diabetic patients have been modeled using the CDM. That study calculated the projected effects on life expectancy and QALE and total costs of complications of 10% improvements in baseline levels of total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, systolic blood pressure, A1C, and all four parameters combined. Despite the lack of studies using models to examine loss of control rather than improved control (through interventions being studied), we believe that this model can be easily applied to estimate the impact of the hurricane on long-term outcomes. The CDM is based on clinical trials/studies. This fact be viewed as a potential criticism of the model, as these data sources may not be suitable for every population or simulated setting nor accurately reflect the real-life situation in which factors such as noncompliance and various standards of care may have an influence. Another limitation that relates to the heterogeneity of the study population is that the customized CDM for the present study is not based on person-specific values to compute overall risk. To compute risk, the default CDM uses the UKPDS data, which have a diet run-in period for a population (no previous cardiovascular disease event or any serious diabetes complication). The clinical pathways/transition probabilities should differ across distinctive populations. However, no changes in model transition probability have been customized for the presenting study by only changing the model parameters.\nOur study is unique in demonstrating the impact of a disaster in the U.S. on a chronic disease condition that is highly prevalent. The factors presented in this study need to be taken into consideration in disaster planning and in addressing chronic health conditions in the aftermath of a disaster. If appropriate action is not taken, the increase in health care costs could be considerable.\nThe costs of publication of this article were defrayed in part by the payment of page charges.

common and serious one is flooding.\n\n Long and heavy rainfall during the last days of October and the first week of November 2008 resulted in a devastating flood unseen for over three decades in the capital city of Hanoi.\n\n It caused a substantial health impact on residents in and around the city and compromised the capacity of local health services.\n\n\nObjective\nThe aim of this study is to ascertain the vulnerability and health impacts of the devastating flood in Hanoi by identifying the differences in mortality, injuries, and morbidity patterns (dengue, pink eye, dermatitis, psychological problems, and hypertension) between flood affected and non-affected households.\n\n\nDesign\nA cross-sectional study was carried out involving 871 households in four selected communes (two heavily flood affected and two comparatively less affected) from two severely flooded districts of Hanoi.\n\n Participants were interviewed and information collected on the social, economic, and health impacts of the devastation within 1 month after the flood.\n\n\nResults\nThe self-reported number of deaths and injuries reported in this study within 1 month after the heavy rainfall were a bit higher in severely affected communes as compared to that of the less affected communes of our study.\n\n The findings showed higher incidences of dengue fever, pink eye, dermatitis, and psychological problems in communes severely affected by flood as compared to that of the controlled communes.\n\n\nConclusions\nFor people in flood prone areas (at risk for flooding), flood prevention

disaster-prone countries in the world. The country suffers from many kinds of natural disasters, of which the most common and serious one is flooding. Long and heavy rainfall during the last days of October and the first week of November 2008 resulted in a devastating flood unseen for over three decades in the capital city of Hanoi. It caused a substantial health impact on residents in and around the city and compromised the capacity of local health services.\nObjective\nThe aim of this study is to ascertain the vulnerability and health impacts of the devastating flood in Hanoi by identifying the differences in mortality, injuries, and morbidity patterns (dengue, pink eye, dermatitis, psychological problems, and hypertension) between flood affected and non-affected households.\nDesign\nA cross-sectional study was carried out involving 871 households in four selected communes (two heavily flood affected and two comparatively less affected) from two severely flooded districts of Hanoi. Participants were interviewed and information collected on the social, economic, and health impacts of the devastation within 1 month after the flood.\nResults\nThe self-reported number of deaths and injuries reported in this study within 1 month after the heavy rainfall were a bit higher in severely affected communes as compared to that of the less affected communes of our study. The findings showed higher incidences of dengue fever, pink eye, dermatitis, and psychological problems in communes severely affected by flood as compared to that of the controlled communes.\nConclusions\nFor people in flood prone areas (at risk for flooding), flood prevention and mitigation strategies need to be seriously thought through and acted upon, as these people are exposed to greater health problems such as psychological issues and communicable diseases such as pink eye or dermatitis.\nFlooding accounts for about 40% of all natural disasters worldwide and causes about half of all deaths. The greatest potential flood hazard is in Asia. Every year for the past two decades more than 400 million people on average have been directly exposed to floods. Between 1987 and 1997, 44% of all flood disasters worldwide affected Asia, claiming 228,000 lives (roughly 93% of all flood-related deaths worldwide). Vietnam is one of the most disaster-prone countries in the world. The country suffers from many kinds of natural disasters, of which the most common and serious one is a flood. In 2007, it was estimated that 400 people died from floods and the economic loss was estimated around 11.5 billion VND (about US$650 million). Threat of climate change, altered patterns of precipitation, and rise in sea level are believed to increase the frequency and intensity of floods in many regions of the world.\nThe health consequences of floods may be described in relation to time (e.g. as intermediate, mid-term, and long-term). The recognised immediate health effects of flooding include drowning, injury, acute asthma, skin rashes and clusters, outbreaks of gastroenteritis, and respiratory infections. The mid-term effects of flooding are infected wounds, complications of injury, poisoning, poor mental health, communicable diseases, and starvation. In the long-term chronic disease, disability, poor mental health, and poverty-related diseases including malnutrition are the potential legacy. The long-term effects of flooding on health may perhaps be even more important than other illnesses or injuries because the psychological problems may continue for long after the water has receded. Floods with long duration cause serious health problems for local people, particularly of the elderly and disabled family members living in poor conditions with limited food stocks, un-hygienic water sources, and poor sanitation. Epidemic diseases such as dengue fever, diarrhea, among many others also appeared after floods. However, as Few et al. note in their recent comprehensive review, there has been only limited systematic research on the health outcomes of flooding.\nLong and heavy rainfall during the last days of October and the first week of November 2008 resulted in the most devastating flood since 1973 in the capital city of Hanoi. Heavy rains in the inner part of Hanoi on October 31st caused 90 points inundated locally with an average depth of 0.3 m-0.8 m. Particularly, there were points inundated with the depth up to 1.2 m in places like Thai Ha, Truong Chinh, and Giap Bat roads; and from 1.0 to 2.5 m in places like Tan Mai and the Dinh Cong areas. According to a primary evaluation of the 10 days of heavy rainfall and flooding (from October 31 to November 9, 2008), 22 people died and 3 were injured. Even about a month after the heavy rainfall in Hanoi, some areas were still deeply inundated. The above mentioned damages of the flood in Hanoi in terms of the deaths and injuries were just very preliminary. It is expected that the long-term impacts on the economic, social, environmental, and health aspects of people living in Hanoi would be significant.\nIn order to ascertain the flood vulnerability, health risks, and social and economic impacts of the devastating flood in Hanoi, a cross-sectional study was conducted through a household survey. This paper used data collected from the MICRODIS household survey early 2009 in Hanoi, Vietnam, which is part of a wider research project involving 15 other countries from Europe and Asia. The MICRODIS is an Integrated Project funded under the EU Sixth Framework Programme - Thematic Priority 6.3 Global Change and Ecosystems (Contract number GOCE-CT-2007-036877). The aim of this paper is to identify the differences in mortality, injuries, and morbidity patterns (dengue, pink eye, dermatitis, psychological problems, and hypertension) between flood affected and non-affected households in Hanoi after the historic flood in 2008. The ultimate aim of this paper is to provide information for designing appropriate early response to flood and preventive strategies for flood prone areas.\nMethodology\nData source\nThe data in this paper were obtained from the MICRODIS project's household survey 2009. The survey was conducted in two districts - Hoang Mai (urban district) and Chuong My (rural district) - in Hanoi capital city of Vietnam. In each district, a severely flooded commune and a less affected commune (control commune) were selected with reference to the district's people committee; households were then randomly selected from the lists of households in each selected commune. The head of the household or his/her counterpart was the key respondent. There were 871 people interviewed at the household level by trained fourth year students of the Hanoi School of Public Health. Data quality was controlled by the field supervisors as well as by the investigators of this survey. The survey questionnaire was adapted from the MICRODIS integrated questionnaire and included three main themes: health, economic, and social. Each theme was adapted from internationally validated questionnaires that were later confirmed by the members of each working group of the MICRODIS project.\nMeasurement\nKey respondent was asked 'Have any of your family members ever had psychological problems, e.g. stress, nervous, anxious, sleeplessness, etc.' The answering options were yes/no. If the answer is yes, then each diseased person in the household was asked through the key respondent whether the psychological problem occurred before the heavy rains or after and, if it occurred before the heavy rains, then whether the condition got worse after the heavy rains/flood. A similar question was asked for hypertension with a special emphasis on diagnosis of hypertension by a health officer. For communicable diseases, the respondent was first asked 'Have any of your family members ever been diagnosed by a health officer as having the disease.' The answering options were yes/no. Then each diseased person in the household was asked through the key respondent whether the disease occurred within 1 month after the heavy rains/flood. Mortality and injuries of family members of study subjects were also measured by the self-reported method within 1 month since the heavy rains started. Information on socio-demographic status of study subjects included educational level, gender, religion, age, marital status, and income per person per month.\nInformation on five health conditions were collected through self-reported method (two non-communicable: psychological problem and hypertension and three communicable diseases: dengue fever, pink eye, and dermatitis) as follows: \nData analysis\nEpidata 3.0 was used for data entry. SPSS software version 17 was used to perform both descriptive and analytical statistics. A conventional significance level of p&lt;0.05 was used.\nEthical considerations\nBefore collecting data in the field, the protocol was submitted to the internal review board (IRB) at the Hanoi School of Public Health. The study was presented and discussed among provincial authorities for their approval. Approval was also received from key informants before carrying out the interview.\nResults\nCharacteristics of study population\nA total of 781 respondents participated in the MICRODIS household survey 2009. The description of the final sample is presented in Table 1. Among the respondents, the proportion of males was higher than that of the females, except for Thanh Tri commune where the proportion of females was a little bit higher (50.8% vs. 49.2%). The average number of persons per household was highest in Nam P. Tien (4.91), a severely flooded commune in rural area of Hanoi and lowest in Thanh Tri, a less affected commune in urban area of Hanoi. Almost all of the people in our sample population said that their religion is to pray to ancestors with about 12% of respondents in the Dong Son commune being Catholics. Buddhists formed about 1% of the respondents from Thanh Tri and Thinh Liet - urban communes of Hanoi - and also those from Dong Son and Nam P. Tien 4.5 and 3.1%, respectively, were Buddhists.\nCharacteristics of study population\n	Rural area of Hanoi	Urban area of Hanoi	 				 		Dong Son Non-flooded	Nam P.

Within rural areas, a significant difference in income between the severely affected commune and the less affected commune (33$ vs 26$ per person per month) was observed. With regards to marital status, about half of our studied population were married, about 40% were unmarried, and about 5% widowed.\nExperience with the heavy rainfall/flood\nResults from Table 2 shows that almost all people in our sample were present at the time of the heavy rainfalls/flood (greater than 97% in all four communes). About half of the people in Nam P. Tien had to migrate due to flooding and in Thinh Liet the number was about 20%. The proportion of people in the two less affected communes who had to migrate due to flooding was very low (1.6% in Dong Son and 2.3% in Thanh Tri). The majority of people who migrated due to flooding stayed in their relative's or friend's house within their commune. In addition, people living in communes that were severely affected by flood reported that they stayed in temporary shelters provided by the government such as in schools, community houses, etc.\nExperience with the historic flood in Hanoi in 2008\n	Rural area of Hanoi	Urban area of Hanoi	 				 		Dong Son Non-flooded	Nam P.

Ninety percent of the school goers in two severely affected communes said that school activities were affected (flooded and closed subsequently) by the flood. Amongst the less affected communes in Dong Son and Thanh Tri, about 66% of schools and 75% of school goers, respectively, said that school activities were affected by the rainfalls. Ninety percent of the respondents from the two severely affected communes and 50% of those from the less affected communes mentioned that daily routine work was affected subsequent to the flood.\nAccess to and use of usual health care service/medication\nAlmost half of the respondents in both severely flooded communes said that the access to and use of their usual health care/medication were compromised during 1 month since the heavy rains and/or flooding (Table 3). These proportions were much lower in two communes that were not severely flooded (7 or 8%). With regards to the question about the reasons why the access and usual health care/medication were compromised by the heavy rainfalls/flood, respondents could give multiple reasons. Among those who said that their access to usual health care or medication was compromised, about two-thirds mentioned that one of the reasons was damaged roads and one-third mentioned unavailability of transportation. One-fifth of the respondents in Thanh Tri and one-third of the respondents in Thinh Liet said that the health centre was destroyed. About 15% of respondents in the Nam P. Tien commune said that it was due to lack of medication or lack of money.\nAccess to health care services\n	Rural area of Hanoi	Urban area of Hanoi	 				 		Dong Son Non-flooded	Nam P.

Tien, two from Thinh Liet, and one death occurred in each less affected commune. Of the two deaths in Thinh Liet, one occurred during the day of the flood and one occurred within the week following the flood. One death in Dong Son, one death in Thanh Tri and two deaths in Nam P. Tien occured during the month following the flood. Two out of seven deaths were reported to be cancer, three others were due to stroke, and the rest (two) were from other causes; four of the seven deaths were reported to be confirmed by a physician or nurse. All seven deaths took place in the individual's respective homes.\nInjuries\nTwenty-seven injuries were reported 1 month after the heavy rainfall/flooding. Types of injuries are reported in Table 4. Three persons suffered bone fracture, one from Dong Son and two from Nam P. Tien. Twelve people suffered lacerations and/or contusions. Seven of these people were from Nam P. Tien, two of them from Thanh Tri, and three lived in Thinh Liet. Two-thirds of the injuries were reported due to falls. Thirteen injuries occurring in Nam P. Tien, nine were due to falls, one person was injured in Thinh Liet due to drowning, and one in Thanh Tri was injured in a traffic accident. Falls and drowning seem to be the attributable injuries to flooding.\nInjuries within 1 month after the historic flood\n	Rural area of Hanoi	Urban area of Hanoi	 				 		Dong Son Non-flooded	Nam P.

The key respondent was in charge of providing information for other family members. The results are presented in Table 5. There were significant differences between the respondents from severely affected commune and those from the less affected communes in terms of the family members suffering from psychological problems. In less affected communes about 90% of people who ever had suffered from psychological problems were reported to have had experienced it before the heavy rains and the flooding, while these proportions in the two severely affected communes of Nam P. Tien and Thinh Liet were 72 and 50%, respectively. Only about one-third of those suffering in less affected communes said that their psychological problems got worse during and after the flood, while the percentage of people in severely affected communes (Nam P. Tien and Thinh Liet) with worsening psychological problem during and after the flood were 84.1 and 63.1%, respectively. These differences are statistically significant.\nHealth conditions within 1 month after the historic flood\n	Rural area of Hanoi	Urban area of Hanoi	 				 		Dong Son Non-flooded	Nam P.

Although almost all reported cases of hypertension occurred before the heavy rain/flood, the percentage of people reporting that it got worse after the flood was significantly higher in the severely affected commune than that of the less affected commune in the urban district (20.3% in Thanh Tri and 42.9% in Thinh Liet).\nTwenty-five people of the sample who reported having ever been diagnosed by a doctor for dengue fever, 15 of them were found in Nam P. Tien, and 7 in Thinh Liet, 3 in Thanh Tri, and only one case occurred in Dong Son. The majority of all cases in the affected communes reported that they were diagnosed with dengue fever after the flood (86.7% in Nam P. Tien and 85.7% in Thinh Liet). Two out of three cases in Thanh Tri occurred after the flood. There were no statistically significant differences in the proportion of dengue cases in flood affected and less affected communes.\nWith regards to pink eye, the number of respondents mentioned that his/her family member ever having pink eye was quite low, about 4% in both the affected and less affected commune in urban area of Hanoi, these proportions were a bit higher in rural areas of Hanoi (14.4% in Dong Son and 22.4% in Nam P. Tien). In both flood affected communes, almost all people who ever had suffered from pink eye were reported to have got pink eye after the flood (92.8% in Nam P. Tien and 100% in Thinh Liet). These proportions in two less affected communes were significantly lower with 64.3% in Dong Son and 45.5% in Thanh Tri.\nWith regards to dermatitis, about 56% of respondents in Nam P. Tien reported that a person from the family had ever been diagnosed by a doctor with dermatitis. This number was significantly lower in its control commune, Dong Son (13.9%). The percentage of people in the urban district who had dermatitis was low in Thinh Liet (12.6%) with a significantly lower percentage in its control commune Thanh Tri (7.2%). And almost all dermatitis cases reported were diagnosed by the health staff after the flood.\nDiscussion\nChuong My, a rural district located in the extended area of Hanoi in August 2008 and Hoang Mai, an urban district located in the old area of Hanoi were selected to be the Hanoi's flood study sites because these were the most severely inundated districts in Hanoi city after the heavy rainfalls on the last days of October and first days of November 2008. The study population (Table 1) showed that there are some differences in demographic characteristics of subjects between the communes in the rural and urban district of Hanoi such as income per person per month, average number of persons per household, and marital status. These variations reflect the difference between urban and rural districts and it was the reason why we separated our data analysis. Within each district there seems to be similar demographic characteristics between severely flooded commune and its control, which is a good indicator of comparability at baseline between the two types of sites and for our later comparisons of flood impacts on health access and health conditions.\nOur study sample covers people who were present in Hanoi and witnessed heavy rainfalls/flooding that occurred in the whole area of Hanoi capital city. The number of people in Nam P. Tien who were displaced was quite high because the commune was seriously flooded. It is located in the flood dividing area of Hanoi city. One cultural characteristic of Vietnamese people is that they often have close relationships with relatives and friends and tend to live near each other. For that reason, the first option for those who had to evacuate their home was to move to a relative or friend's house nearby, followed by other options such as moving to the community house, schools, and so on. When planning preventive and alleviation strategies during the rainy season, such relocation options should be taken into consideration.\nFlooding has compromised access to crucial health services in many countries where infrastructure is poor and the population at risk has limited economic resources. Our study showed similar results. In this study we found that the usual health care services and medication for people were not available for 50% of residents in both urban and rural flood affected communes. This was mainly due to roads heavily damaged by rain and unavailable transportation facilities. An epidemiologic review revealed that in developing countries accurate information on the mortality impact of flood events is particularly limited. In this study, 7 deaths were reported in 781 households (3,910 people) within 1 month of the flood - though the causes of death (cancer, stroke, and others) were not necessarily a consequence of the flood. A similar result was found in the study of Kunii et al. who conducted a cross-sectional survey after the 1998 floods in Bangladesh and of 3,109 people from flood-affected households, seven (0.23%) died during (but not necessarily a consequence of) the flood - two from diarrhea, two from suspected heart attacks, and three from undetermined/unrecorded causes.\nWhen it comes to injuries, the result showed that falls and drowning were the major cause of injuries occurring within 1 month of the flood. Flood prevention and mitigation strategies should warn people in the flood prone area about these potential dangers.\nWith regards to health conditions, although this study is just a snapshot of the heath situation of residents in four studied communes within 1 month after the heavy rains/flooding in Hanoi, the findings revealed higher proportions of pink eye, dermatitis, and psychological problems in severely affected communes as compared to that of the controlled communes. These findings help for additional evidence to the current weak base when assessing the health impacts of flooding. Few et al. note in their recent comprehensive review there has been only limited systematic research on the health outcomes of flooding. Hajat et al. also highlight the lack of good quantitative data available on the health effects of flooding, resulting in the uncertainty about the full range of potential health impacts.\nA major limitation of our study was the necessity to collect data on health and mortality by the self-reported method, but as this study was just part of a larger project in which data was collected from 15 other countries in Asia and Europe within limited time, adoption of any other alternative was not feasible. In addition, with the nature of a cross-sectional study, causal relationship cannot be proven but results from this study suggested that people living in flood prone areas do face greater health problems than people in less affected areas. Although we cannot claim that our sample is representative of Vietnamese people living in flood prone areas, this study is one of the very first of its kind that has examined the health impacts of floods in Vietnam.\nIn conclusion, results from this study suggest that flood prevention and mitigation strategies need to be put in place in flood prone areas because these people are exposed to greater health problems such as psychological issues, and communicable diseases such as pink eye or dermatitis. It is important that those who provide medical care need to be aware of the increased medical and mental health needs of the people who have experienced floods. Suffering with psychological issues may continue long after the water has receded. In the future, if flood events become more common and severe, improving the services available to people at the time of a flood event and during the recovery period may be important to improve their mental health and to reduce the burden on medical services. Our experience shows that further research is needed for better health measures and stronger epidemiological designs like cohort studies to improve understanding of the risks of flooding and the long-term consequences on people's health.

Choice Experiment in Citrus Fruit Retail","abstract":"Amid the trend of sustainable development, reducing food waste is a global concern and campaigns to reduce food waste have been launched.\n For example, the term “food sharing” has originated from Germany and promotes sharing food instead of wasting.\n “The Guerilla Kitchen”, which originated from Netherlands, is an organization that also promotes avoiding wasting food.\n Consequently, more and more people are paying attention on this issue and we think it is necessary to understand people’s acceptance of suboptimal food, as discarded suboptimal food represents a significant proportion of food waste.\n Additionally, at least one-third of the food globally produced each year is classified as suboptimal and cannot be sold in the market because of a poor appearance, damaged packaging, or near expiration date, thus presenting challenges for environmental, social, and economic sustainability.\n Previous studies on suboptimal food have focused more on appearances and packaging dates and less on investigating traceable agricultural and price discounts, which is where food classified as suboptimal entails a discount.\n Moreover, citrus product attributes such as appearance, size, freshness indicators, traceable agricultural products, and price discounts were determined in terms of consumer preference through pre-measurement here, then using a choice experiment method to clarify which attributes consumers care about most (N = 485 respondents).\n Conditional logistic regression and a random parameter logit model (RPL) are employed to examine the various properties of a marginal willingness to pay (WTP).\n RPL was also used to deduce the respondents’ choices based on differences in appearance and freshness indicator.\n The results showed that consumers place greater emphasis on the freshness indicators (harvesting/packaging date labels) and appearance of suboptimal citrus fruits but do not focus on the size.\n Consumers are willing to purchase citrus fruit with a flawed appearance, although the price needs to be reduced from the original price.\n Although suboptimal food does not reduce health, people may still not buy it and this result in food wastage.\n As a result, it is essential to increase awareness regarding suboptimal foods and reduce food waste to support sustainable development.\n","id":"PMC7822445","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"MDPI","authors":[{"firstname":"Wen-Shin","surname":"Huang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Hung-Yu","surname":"Kuo","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Shi-Yuan","surname":"Tung","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Shi-Yuan","surname":"Tung","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Han-Shen","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Retail

and precipitation response to greenhouse gas forcing","abstract":"id='Par1'>As evidence of climate change strengthens, knowledge of its regional implications becomes an urgent need for decision making.\n Current understanding of regional precipitation changes is substantially limited by our understanding of the atmospheric circulation response to climate change, which to a high degree remains uncertain.\n This uncertainty is reflected in the wide spread in atmospheric circulation changes projected in multimodel ensembles, which cannot be directly interpreted in a probabilistic sense.\n The uncertainty can instead be represented by studying a discrete set of physically plausible storylines of atmospheric circulation changes.\n By mining CMIP5 model output, here we take this broader perspective and develop storylines for Southern Hemisphere (SH) midlatitude circulation changes, conditioned on the degree of global-mean warming, based on the climate responses of two remote drivers: the enhanced warming of the tropical upper troposphere and the strengthening of the stratospheric polar vortex.\n For the three continental domains in the SH, we analyse the precipitation changes under each storyline.\n To allow comparison with previous studies, we also link both circulation and precipitation changes with those of the Southern Annular Mode.\n Our results show that the response to tropical warming leads to a strengthening of the midlatitude westerly winds, whilst the response to a delayed breakdown (for DJF) or strengthening (for JJA) of the stratospheric vortex leads to a poleward shift of the westerly winds and the storm tracks.\n However, the circulation response is not zonally symmetric and the regional precipitation storylines for South America, South Africa, South of Australia and New Zealand exhibit quite specific dependencies on the two remote drivers, which are not well represented by changes in the Southern Annular Mode.\n","id":"PMC7250812","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Springer Berlin

moreover, depth and frictional changes affect tide, surge, and wave characteristics, altering the relative importance of other risk factors.\n Consequently, sea-level driven changes in wave characteristics, and to a lesser extent, tides, amplify the resulting design heights by an average of 48–56%, relative to design changes caused by SLR alone.\n Since many of the world’s most vulnerable coastlines are impacted by depth-limited waves, our results suggest that the overall influence of SLR may be greatly underestimated in many regions.\n","id":"PMC5216410","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Nature Publishing Group","authors":[{"firstname":"Arne","surname":"Arns","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Sönke","surname":"Dangendorf?","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Jürgen","surname":"Jensen","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Stefan","surname":"Talke","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Jens","surname":"Bender","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Charitha","surname":"Pattiaratchi","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"10.1002/2017GL075963","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Tidal response to sea-level rise in different types of estuaries: the importance of length, bathymetry, and geometry","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1175/2010JCLI3520.1","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Interpreting century-scale changes in southern North Sea storm surge climate derived from coupled model simulations","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1016/j.ocecoaman.2011.09.005","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Changing North Sea storm surge climate: an increasing hazard?","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1016/j.gloplacha.2013.02.006","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Long-term changes in sea-level components in Latin America and the Caribbean","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1175/JCLI-D-16-0553.1","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Projected significant increase in the number of extreme extratropical cyclones in the Southern Hemisphere","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1007/s00382-014-2426-8","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Extratropical cyclones and the projected decline of winter Mediterranean precipitation in the CMIP5 models","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1175/1520-0493(1995)123&lt;3458:FTOTUS&gt;2.0.CO;2","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Feature tracking on the unit sphere","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1175/1520-0493(1999)127&lt;1362:ACFFT&gt;2.0.CO;2","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Adaptive constraints for feature tracking","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1175/1520-0469(2002)059&lt;1041:NPOTNH&gt;2.0.CO;2","date":"1970-01-01","title":"New perspectives on the Northern Hemisphere winter storm tracks","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1175/2009BAMS2755.1","date":"1970-01-01","title":"The international best track archive for climate stewardship (IBTrACS) unifying tropical cyclone data","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1175/1520-0493(1996)124&lt;2914:SNEATT&gt;2.0.CO;2","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Spherical nonparametric estimators applied to the UGAMP model integration for AMIP","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1016/j.coastaleng.2007.05.007","date":"1970-01-01","title":"A multivariate model of sea storms using copulas","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1007/s00477-014-0916-1","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Dismissing return periods!","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1029/2009WR008388","date":"1970-01-01","title":"A comparative copula-based bivariate frequency analysis of observed and simulated storm events: a case study on Bartlett-Lewis modeled rainfall","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Schepsmeier, U. et al.

Epidemiological and laboratory findings","abstract":"Introduction\nIn October 2017, a blood sample from a resident of Kween District, Eastern Uganda, tested positive for Marburg virus.\n\n Within 24 hour of confirmation, a rapid outbreak response was initiated.\n\n Here, we present results of epidemiological and laboratory investigations.\n\n\nMethods\nA district task force was activated consisting of specialised teams to conduct case finding, case management and isolation, contact listing and follow up, sample collection and testing, and community engagement.\n\n An ecological investigation was also carried out to identify the potential source of infection.\n\n Virus isolation and Next Generation sequencing were performed to identify the strain of Marburg virus.\n\n\nResults\nSeventy individuals (34 MVD suspected cases and 36 close contacts of confirmed cases) were epidemiologically investigated, with blood samples tested for MVD.\n\n Only four cases met the MVD case definition; one was categorized as a probable case while the other three were confirmed cases.\n\n A total of 299 contacts were identified; during follow- up, two were confirmed as MVD.\n\n Of the four confirmed and probable MVD cases, three died, yielding a case fatality rate of 75%.\n\n All four cases belonged to a single family and 50% (2/4) of the MVD cases were female.\n\n All confirmed cases had clinical symptoms of fever, vomiting, abdominal pain and bleeding from body orifices.\n\n Viral sequences indicated that the Marburg virus strain responsible for this outbreak was closely related to virus strains previously shown to be circulating in Uganda.\n\n\nConclusion\nThis outbreak of MVD occurred as a family cluster with no additional transmission outside of the four related cases.\n\n Rapid case detection, prompt laboratory testing at the Uganda National VHF Reference Laboratory and presence of pre-trained, well-prepared national and district rapid response teams facilitated the containment and control of this outbreak within one month, preventing nationwide and global transmission of the disease.\n\n\n","id":"PMC6438581","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Public Library of

security, are designed to prevent and cope with major international public health threats.\n But poor implementation in countries hampers their effectiveness.\n In the wake of a number of major international health crises, such as the 2014 Ebola and 2016 Zika outbreaks, and the findings of a number of high-level assessments of the global response to these crises, it has become clear that there is a need for more joined-up thinking between health system strengthening activities and health security efforts for prevention, alert and response.\n WHO is working directly with its Member States to promote this approach, more specifically around how to better embed the IHR (2005) core capacities into the main health system functions.\n This paper looks at how and where the intersections between the IHR and the health system can be best leveraged towards developing greater health system resilience.\n This merging of approaches is a key component in pursuit of Universal

assessing global resilience to epidemic and pandemic outbreaks.\n\n However, existing preparedness assessments focus primarily on public health systems or specific legislative frameworks, and do not measure other essential capacities that enable and support public health preparedness and response.\n\n\nMethods\nWe developed an Epidemic Preparedness Index (EPI) to assess national-level preparedness.\n\n The EPI is global, covering 188 countries.\n\n It consists of five subindices measuring each country’s economic resources, public health communications, infrastructure, public health systems and institutional capacity.\n\n To evaluate the construct validity of the EPI, we tested its correlation with proxy measures for preparedness and response capacity, including the timeliness of outbreak detection and reporting, as well as vaccination rates during the 2009?H1N1 influenza pandemic.\n\n\nResults\nThe most prepared countries were concentrated in Europe and North America, while the least prepared countries clustered in Central and West Africa and Southeast Asia.\n\n Better prepared countries were found to report infectious disease outbreaks more quickly and to have vaccinated a larger proportion of their population during the 2009 pandemic.\n\n\nConclusion\nThe EPI measures a country’s capacity to detect and respond to infectious disease events.\n\n Existing tools, such as the Joint External Evaluation (JEE), have been designed to measure preparedness within a country over time.\n\n The EPI complements the JEE by providing a holistic view of preparedness and is constructed to support comparative risk assessment between countries.\n\n The index can be updated rapidly to generate global estimates of pandemic preparedness that can inform strategy and resource allocation.\n\n\n","id":"PMC6352812","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"BMJ Publishing
