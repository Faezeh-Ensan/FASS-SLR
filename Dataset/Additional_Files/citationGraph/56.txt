There is limited evidence about in utero infection and early positive neonatal testing. A 41-year-old G3P2 with a history of previous cesarean deliveries and diabetes mellitus presented with a 4-day history of malaise, low-grade fever, and progressive shortness of breath. A nasopharyngeal swab was positive for COVID-19, COVID-19 serology was negative. The patient developed respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation on day 5 of disease onset. The patient underwent a cesarean delivery, and neonatal isolation was implemented immediately after birth, without delayed cord clamping or skin-to-skin contact. The neonatal nasopharyngeal swab, 16 hours after delivery, was positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), and immunoglobulin (Ig)-M and IgG for SARS-CoV-2 were negative. Maternal IgM and IgG were positive on postpartum day 4 (day 9 after symptom onset). We report a severe presentation of COVID-19 during pregnancy. To our knowledge, this is the earliest reported positive PCR in the neonate, raising the concern for vertical transmission. We suggest pregnant women should be considered as a high-risk group and minimize exposures for these reasons.\n Key Points \nWe report a severe presentation of COVID-19 in pregnancy requiring invasive ventilatory support.\nThis is a case of positive RT-PCR in first day of life, suggesting possible vertical transmission.\nThere were no detectable maternal antibodies for COVID-19 until after delivery.\n The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a highly infectious disease that was first described by Huang et al,  whose report focused primarily on the main characteristics and outcomes of nonpregnant adults. The largest published series in pregnancy described 55 pregnant women infected with COVID-19, of whom only one had a severe presentation, and there were no deaths.  There is still much unknown regarding the impact of the disease on pregnancy, differences in clinical course, and outcomes in this population, as well as the risk of vertical transmission. \n Physiological changes during pregnancy, such as reduced functional residual volumes, diaphragm elevation, and altered cell immunity, lead to increased susceptibility to viral infections and worse outcomes.  In SARS and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), up to 35 and 41% of pregnant patients required mechanical ventilation, and mortality rates were as high as 18 and 25%, respectively.    In contrast, the majority of reported cases of COVID-19 infection in pregnant patients have shown a mild or asymptomatic course of the disease, with only few cases requiring intensive care unit (ICU) admission, and only a few reported cases requiring mechanical ventilation.      \n To date, there is no concrete evidence of whether there is in utero transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Two cases of neonates with positive real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing soon after delivery have been described.   However, these cases lack essential clinical data and information regarding adequate isolation, which raises the possibility of infection in the neonatal period. \nHerein, we describe a case of COVID-19 infection in a pregnant woman requiring mechanical ventilation and cesarean delivery, as well as a neonate with positive testing, 16 hours after birth.\nCase Report\nOn March 29, 2020, a 41-year-old woman (gravida 3, para 2) was transferred to our institution at 33 weeks of gestation due to respiratory insufficiency. Her medical history was remarkable for two previous cesarean deliveries and diabetes mellitus. She was treated with metformin and insulin until the beginning of the current pregnancy. She received prenatal care at another institution.\n The patient presented with a 4-day history of general malaise, fatigue, and low-grade fever, and later developed worsening shortness of breath, which prompted her to seek medical attention. She was admitted to an outside hospital and remained there for 3 days. She received a steroid course of lung maturity during her admission at the outside hospital. She was then transferred to our institution for further care. Of importance, her partner and two children were symptomatic in the 15 days prior to admission. The partner tested positive for RT-PCR SARS-CoV-2 while the patient was in the hospital. In the emergency department, the patient's pulse was 131 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 38 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 99% with a FiO2 of approximately 90%. Her body mass index (BMI) was 35 kg/m 2 . Laboratory tests showed metabolic acidosis on arterial blood gases, pancytopenia, elevated C-reactive protein, elevated ferritin, and slightly elevated D-dimer and glucose ( Table 1 ). A nasopharyngeal swab was obtained for SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR which was reported as positive on the next day, and for Viral Filmarray and PneumoVir panel, both reported negative for common viruses.

CT, computed tomography.\n\nThe patient was intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation due to severe respiratory insufficiency in the setting of suspected COVID-19. Patient was started on azithromycin, hydroxychloroquine, meropenem, vancomycin, and oseltamivir. The patient underwent a cesarean delivery due to maternal respiratory compromised status. The neonate weighed 2,970 g, with Apgar's scores of 6 and 8 at 1 and 5 minutes, respectively. The neonate was intubated in another room due to the high level of sedation of the mother. Delayed cord clamping or skin-to-skin contact was not performed due to general depressed state of the neonate. He was immediately separated from his mother and was not exposed to family members, who were at home under strict isolation measures. Due to the maternal condition, maternal medical regimen, breastfeeding was not initiated. He was placed in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) with no other COVID-19 cases, as this was the first pediatric case at our institution. Chest X-ray showed no abnormalities.\nBaseline and follow-up neonatal serology obtained at birth, and analyzed by solid-phase immunochromatographic assay (Zhejiang Orient Gene Biotech Co.), yielded negative immunoglobulin (Ig)-G and IgM titers. Nasopharyngeal swab of neonate for SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR, obtained 16 hours after delivery (as soon as the maternal PCR resulted), was reported positive. RT-PCR repeated 48 hours later for confirmation was also positive. Maternal serology on postpartum day 1 showed negative IgG and IgM levels, followed by positive IgG and IgM on repeat testing on postpartum day 4 (day 9 after symptom onset).\nThe newborn required ventilatory support for 12 hours, after which he was extubated and placed on continuous positive airway pressure, with favorable outcome and not requiring antibiotic treatment. At the sixth day of life, the newborn presented mild respiratory difficulty and sporadic cough requiring supplemental oxygen with nasal cannula. Imaging and laboratory testing remain normal.\nDiscussion\n We report a severe clinical presentation of COVID-19 during pregnancy, leading to respiratory failure, mechanical ventilation, and preterm delivery. This adds to a growing body of evidence which raises concerns about possible worse maternal outcomes in pregnancy, as seen with previous COVID-19 outbreaks.   The most commonly described course of disease in pregnancy is that of an asymptomatic infection or mild pneumonia, and most cases resolved without undergoing delivery.    Few cases required ICU admission and one case required invasive ventilation with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation.   It is unknown whether pregnancy-related immune regulation alters the disease course by suppressing the exaggerated inflammatory response seen in this disease and associated with a poorer prognosis.  It is important to mention that this patient had diabetes and class II obesity, both risk factors for severe COVID-19. We do not have enough reported data to ascertain that pregnancy does not lead to worse outcomes, particularly in high-risk pregnant patients.   \n In previous reports, most of the deliveries were performed by cesarean. In our patient, a preterm cesarean delivery was performed due to her history of two prior cesareans, completed antenatal steroid course, and severe maternal pulmonary insufficiency. Different recommendations for cesarean delivery during COVID-19 infection have been described, most of them related to common obstetric factors such as history of cesareans, preeclampsia or fetal distress. There is a lack of convincing evidence that cesarean delivery is protective. Vaginal delivery is not contraindicated in patients with COVID-19.   \n The risk of vertical transmission remains unknown. A major finding in this case is the positive testing on RT-PCR of neonatal nasopharyngeal swab as soon as 16 hours after delivery. We believe there is a low probability of infection during the cesarean or postnatally due to sterility of the procedure and isolation measures implemented immediately after birth, strongly raising the suspicion of in utero transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Prior studies have failed to demonstrate maternal-fetal transmission of SARS-CoV-2, including negative testing in amniotic fluid, umbilical cord blood, vaginal swabs, and breast milk.      A case series of nine pregnant women with COVID-19 demonstrated negative nasopharyngeal swabs on all neonates. Two neonates with positive RT-PCR testing as early as 30 hours after delivery have been reported; however, these cases lacked sufficient clinical data or precise information regarding isolation methods, and perinatal transmission could not be ruled out.   \n Recently, Dong et al and Zeng et al reported virus-specific IgM antibodies in neonatal blood immediately after birth, with negative testing on RT-PCR of nasopharyngeal swab, in neonates with SARS-CoV-2 infected mothers.   Given that IgM does not usually cross the placental barrier due to its structure, it is possible that IgM was produced in the fetus in response to vertical transmission of the virus. However this is not conclusive evidence, and may also be due to placental alterations allowing the passage of IgM, or false positive testing. \n We found negative serology in both mother and neonate on the day of birth, and later seroconversion of the mother, likely due to the acute presentation of COVID-19. These are consistent with the serological conversion curve described in other studies in which IgM seroconverts after day 5 of symptom onset. The evolution of serologic testing of both the mother and neonate are shown in Fig. 2 . The neonatal serology remained negative up to 5 days of life. This could be explained by the immaturity of the adaptive immunity in the neonatal period, especially seen in preterm neonates, which results in impaired cytokine and B-cell immunoglobulin production relative to adults.  \n\nTimeline illustrating serologic assay results evolution in mother and neonate. Ig, immunoglobulin; RT-PCR, real-time polymerase chain reaction.\n\n Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) has been described as a SARS-CoV-2 receptor in humans. There is conflicting evidence regarding the interaction of ACE2 and SARS-CoV-2 at the placental level. Dong et al  demonstrated transient ACE2 overexpression and increased activity in the placenta and reproductive organs in rats during pregnancy. In contrast, Zeng et al  described very low expression of ACE2 in almost all human cell types of the early maternal-fetal interface, suggesting the placenta had virtually no susceptible cells to the virus. \nLimitations\nOur report has some limitations. The lag-time to neonatal nasopharyngeal swab, due to the current national criteria for testing, raises the possibility of perinatal transmission, though this was minimized by the procedures described above. We did not evaluate the presence of virus in amniotic fluid, cord blood, or placental tissue that could further clarify pathogenesis.\nConclusion\nWe describe a severe maternal presentation of COVID-19 during the third trimester of pregnancy, leading to mechanical ventilation and preterm delivery, as well as positive RT-PCR, in the neonate. We believe these findings have important public implications both due to the severity of disease presentation, and the concern for vertical transmission. Given this information, pregnant women should be considered a vulnerable population in which exposure is to be avoided.\nConflict of Interest None declared.\nReferences\nClinical features of patients infected with 2019 novel coronavirus in Wuhan, China\nCoronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Pandemic and Pregnancy\npregnancy and perinatal outcomes of women with coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pneumonia: a preliminary analysis\nPotential maternal and infant outcomes from (Wuhan) coronavirus 2019-nCoV infecting pregnant women: lessons from SARS, MERS, and other human coronavirus infections\nClinical characteristics and intrauterine vertical transmission potential of COVID-19 infection in nine pregnant women: a retrospective review of medical records\nAn uncomplicated delivery in a patient with COVID-19 in the United States\nCOVID-19 in pregnancy: early lessons\nClinical course and risk factors for mortality of adult inpatients with COVID-19 in Wuhan, China: a retrospective cohort study\n[Clinical characteristics and outcomes of 112 cardiovascular disease patients infected by 2019-nCoV] (in Chinese)\nPerinatal transmission of COVID-19 associated SARS-CoV-2: should we worry?\nNovel coronavirus infection and pregnancy\nEarly release - lack of vertical transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, China\nPossible vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from an infected mother to her newborn\nAntibodies in infants born to mothers with COVID-19 pneumonia\nThe immune consequences of preterm birth\n","References depth 1":[{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Clinical features of patients infected with 2019 novel coronavirus in Wuhan, China","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[],"References depth 2":[{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"A familial cluster of pneumonia associated with the 2019 novel coronavirus indicating person-to-person transmission: a study of a family cluster","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1016/s0140-6736(20)30154-9","date":"1970-01-01","title":"A familial cluster of pneumonia associated with the 2019 novel coronavirus indicating person-to-person transmission: a study of a family cluster","abstract":"Background\nAn ongoing outbreak of pneumonia associated with a novel coronavirus was reported in Wuhan city, Hubei province, China.\n\n Affected patients were geographically linked with a local wet market as a potential source.\n\n No data on person-to-person or nosocomial transmission have been published to date.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this study, we report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, radiological, and microbiological findings of five patients in a family cluster who presented with unexplained pneumonia after returning to Shenzhen, Guangdong province, China, after a visit to Wuhan, and an additional family member who did not travel to Wuhan.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of genetic sequences from these patients were done.\n\n\nFindings\nFrom Jan 10, 2020, we enrolled a family of six patients who travelled to Wuhan from Shenzhen between Dec 29, 2019 and Jan 4, 2020. Of six family members who travelled to Wuhan, five were identified as infected with the novel coronavirus.\n\n Additionally, one family member, who did not travel to Wuhan, became infected with the virus after several days of contact with four of the family members.\n\n None of the family members had contacts with Wuhan markets or animals, although two had visited a Wuhan hospital.\n\n Five family members (aged 36–66 years) presented with fever, upper or lower respiratory tract symptoms, or diarrhoea, or a combination of these 3–6 days after exposure.\n\n They presented to our hospital (The University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen) 6–10 days after symptom onset.\n\n They and one asymptomatic child (aged 10 years) had radiological ground-glass lung opacities.\n\n Older patients (aged &gt;60 years) had more systemic symptoms, extensive radiological ground-glass lung changes, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and increased C-reactive protein and lactate dehydrogenase levels.\n\n The nasopharyngeal or throat swabs of these six patients were negative for known respiratory microbes by point-of-care multiplex RT-PCR, but five patients (four adults and the child) were RT-PCR positive for genes encoding the internal RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and surface Spike protein of this novel coronavirus, which were confirmed by Sanger sequencing.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these five patients' RT-PCR amplicons and two full genomes by next-generation sequencing showed that this is a novel coronavirus, which is closest to the bat severe acute respiatory syndrome (SARS)-related coronaviruses found in Chinese horseshoe bats.\n\n\nInterpretation\nOur findings are consistent with person-to-person transmission of this novel coronavirus in hospital and family settings, and the reports of infected travellers in other geographical regions.\n\n\nFunding\nThe Shaw Foundation Hong Kong, Michael Seak-Kan Tong, Respiratory Viral Research Foundation Limited, Hui

outcomes in patients with a number of different malignancies.\n\n The objective of this study was to assess the relationship between NLR and mortality in a population of adult critically ill patients.\n\n\nMethods\nWe performed an observational cohort study of unselected intensive care unit (ICU) patients based on records in a large clinical database.\n\n We computed individual patient NLR and categorized patients by quartile of this ratio.\n\n The association of NLR quartiles and 28-day mortality was assessed using multivariable logistic regression.\n\n Secondary outcomes included mortality in the ICU, in-hospital mortality and 1-year mortality.\n\n An a priori subgroup analysis of patients with versus without sepsis was performed to assess any differences in the relationship between the NLR and outcomes in these cohorts.\n\n\nResults\nA total of 5,056 patients were included.\n\n Their 28-day mortality rate was 19%.\n\n The median age of the cohort was 65 years, and 47% were female.\n\n The median NLR for the entire cohort was 8.9 (interquartile range, 4.99 to 16.21).\n\n Following multivariable adjustments, there was a stepwise increase in mortality with increasing quartiles of NLR (first quartile: reference category; second quartile odds ratio (OR) = 1.32; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.03 to 1.71; third quartile OR = 1.43; 95% CI, 1.12 to 1.83; 4th quartile OR = 1.71; 95% CI, 1.35 to 2.16).\n\n A similar stepwise relationship was identified in the subgroup of patients who presented without sepsis.\n\n The NLR was not associated with 28-day mortality in patients with sepsis.\n\n Increasing quartile of NLR was statistically significantly associated with secondary outcome.\n\n\nConclusion\nThe NLR is associated with outcomes in unselected critically ill patients.\n\n In patients with sepsis, there was no statistically significant relationship between NLR and mortality.\n\n Further investigation is required to increase understanding of the pathophysiology of this relationship and to validate these findings with data collected prospectively.\n\n\nElectronic supplementary material\nThe online version of this article

recently reported in Wuhan, Hubei province, China.\n As of 25 January 2020, at least 1,975 cases had been reported since the first patient was hospitalized on 12 December 2019. Epidemiological investigations have suggested that the outbreak was associated with a seafood market in Wuhan.\n Here we study a single patient who was a worker at the market and who was admitted to the Central Hospital of Wuhan on 26 December 2019 while experiencing a severe respiratory syndrome that included fever, dizziness and a cough.\n Metagenomic RNA sequencing4 of a sample of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from the patient identified a new RNA virus strain from the family Coronaviridae, which is designated here ‘WH-Human 1’ coronavirus (and has also been referred to as ‘2019-nCoV’).\n Phylogenetic analysis of the complete viral genome (29,903 nucleotides) revealed that the virus was most closely related (89.1% nucleotide similarity) to a group of SARS-like

features of patients infected with 2019 novel coronavirus in Wuhan, China","abstract":"Background\nA recent cluster of pneumonia cases in Wuhan, China, was caused by a novel betacoronavirus, the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).\n\n We report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatment and clinical outcomes of these patients.\n\n\nMethods\nAll patients with suspected 2019-nCoV were admitted to a designated hospital in Wuhan.\n\n We prospectively collected and analysed data on patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection by real-time RT-PCR and next-generation sequencing.\n\n Data were obtained with standardised data collection forms shared by WHO and the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium from electronic medical records.\n\n Researchers also directly communicated with patients or their families to ascertain epidemiological and symptom data.\n\n Outcomes were also compared between patients who had been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and those who had not.\n\n\nFindings\nBy Jan 2, 2020, 41 admitted hospital patients had been identified as having laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection.\n\n Most of the infected patients were men (30 [73%] of 41); less than half had underlying diseases (13 [32%]), including diabetes (eight [20%]), hypertension (six [15%]), and cardiovascular disease (six [15%]).\n\n Median age was 49·0 years (IQR 41·0–58·0).\n\n 27 (66%) of 41 patients had been exposed to Huanan seafood market.\n\n One family cluster was found.\n\n Common symptoms at onset of illness were fever (40 [98%] of 41 patients), cough (31 [76%]), and myalgia or fatigue (18 [44%]); less common symptoms were sputum production (11 [28%] of 39), headache (three [8%] of 38), haemoptysis (two [5%] of 39), and diarrhoea (one [3%] of 38).\n\n Dyspnoea developed in 22 (55%) of 40 patients (median time from illness onset to dyspnoea 8·0 days [IQR 5·0–13·0]).\n\n 26 (63%) of 41 patients had lymphopenia.\n\n All 41 patients had pneumonia with abnormal findings on chest CT.\n\n Complications included acute respiratory distress syndrome (12 [29%]), RNAaemia (six [15%]), acute cardiac injury (five [12%]) and secondary infection (four [10%]).\n\n 13 (32%) patients were admitted to an ICU and six (15%) died.\n\n Compared with non-ICU patients, ICU patients had higher plasma levels of IL2, IL7, IL10, GSCF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNF?.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe 2019-nCoV infection caused clusters of severe respiratory illness similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and was associated with ICU admission and high mortality.\n\n Major gaps in our knowledge of the origin, epidemiology, duration of human transmission, and clinical spectrum of disease need fulfilment by future studies.\n\n\nFunding\nMinistry of Science and Technology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, National Natural Science Foundation of China,

January 2020. We analyzed data on the first 425 confirmed cases in Wuhan to determine the epidemiologic characteristics of NCIP.\n\n\nMethods\nWe collected information on demographic characteristics, exposure history, and illness timelines of laboratory-confirmed cases of NCIP that had been reported by January 22, 2020. We described characteristics of the cases and estimated the key epidemiologic time-delay distributions.\n\n In the early period of exponential growth, we estimated the epidemic doubling time and the basic reproductive number.\n\n\nResults\nAmong the first 425 patients with confirmed NCIP, the median age was 59 years and 56% were male.\n\n The majority of cases (55%) with onset before January 1, 2020, were linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, as compared with 8.6% of the subsequent cases.\n\n The mean incubation period was 5.2 days (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.1 to 7.0), with the 95th percentile of the distribution at 12.5 days.\n\n In its early stages, the epidemic doubled in size every 7.4 days.\n\n With a mean serial interval of 7.5 days (95% CI, 5.3 to 19), the basic reproductive number was estimated to be 2.2 (95% CI, 1.4 to 3.9).\n\n\nConclusions\nOn the basis of this information, there is evidence that human-to-human transmission has occurred among close contacts since the middle of December 2019.

Limited data are available about coronavirus disease 2019 during pregnancy; however, information on illnesses associated with other highly pathogenic coronaviruses (ie, severe acute respiratory syndrome and the Middle East respiratory syndrome) might provide insights into coronavirus disease 2019’s effects during pregnancy.\n Coronaviruses cause illness ranging in severity from the common cold to severe respiratory illness and death.\n Currently the primary epidemiologic risk factors for coronavirus disease 2019 include travel from mainland China (especially Hubei Province) or close contact with infected individuals within 14 days of symptom onset.\n Data suggest an incubation period of ?5 days (range, 2–14 days).\n Average age of hospitalized patients has been 49–56 years, with a third to half with an underlying illness.\n Children have been rarely reported.\n Men were more frequent among hospitalized cases (54–73%).\n Frequent manifestations include fever, cough, myalgia, headache, and diarrhea.\n Abnormal testing includes abnormalities on chest radiographic imaging, lymphopenia, leukopenia, and thrombocytopenia.\n Initial reports suggest that acute respiratory distress syndrome develops in 17–29% of hospitalized patients.\n Overall case fatality rate appears to be ?1%; however, early data may overestimate this rate.\n In 2 reports describing 18 pregnancies with coronavirus disease 2019, all were infected in the third trimester, and clinical findings were similar to those in nonpregnant adults.\n Fetal distress and preterm delivery were seen in some cases.\n All but 2 pregnancies were cesarean deliveries and no evidence of in utero transmission was seen.\n","id":"PMC7093856","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Elsevier Inc.","authors":[{"firstname":"Sonja A.","surname":"Rasmussen","email":"skr9@ufl.edu","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"John C.","surname":"Smulian","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"John A.","surname":"Lednicky","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Tony S.","surname":"Wen","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Denise J.","surname":"Jamieson","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Current challenges in the management of sepsis in ICUs in resource-poor settings and suggestions for the future","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"SMFM Consult Series #47: Sepsis during pregnancy and the puerperium","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Circulating high sensitivity troponin T in severe sepsis and septic shock: distribution, associated factors, and relation to outcome","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Acute respiratory failure and mechanical ventilation in pregnant patient: A narrative review of literature","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Clinical management of severe acute respiratory infection when novel coronavirus (nCoV) infection is suspected.

of preterm infants and postnatal corticosteroids are used to treat bronchopulmonary dysplasia.\n\n\nObjective\nTo test if antenatal or postnatal corticosteroids would decrease resuscitation induced lung injury.\n\n\nMethods\n129 d gestational age lambs (n = 5-8/gp; term = 150 d) were operatively delivered and ventilated after exposure to either 1) no medication, 2) antenatal maternal IM Betamethasone 0.5 mg/kg 24 h prior to delivery, 3) 0.5 mg/kg Dexamethasone IV at delivery or 4) Cortisol 2 mg/kg IV at delivery.\n\n Lambs then were ventilated with no PEEP and escalating tidal volumes (VT) to 15 mL/kg for 15 min and then given surfactant.\n\n The lambs were ventilated with VT 8 mL/kg and PEEP 5 cmH20 for 2 h 45 min.\n\n\nResults\nHigh VT ventilation caused a deterioration of lung physiology, lung inflammation and injury.\n\n Antenatal betamethasone improved ventilation, decreased inflammatory cytokine mRNA expression and alveolar protein leak, but did not prevent neutrophil influx.\n\n Postnatal dexamethasone decreased pro-inflammatory cytokine expression, but had no beneficial effect on ventilation, and postnatal cortisol had no effect.\n\n Ventilation increased liver serum amyloid mRNA expression, which was unaffected by corticosteroids.\n\n\nConclusions\nAntenatal betamethasone decreased lung injury without decreasing lung inflammatory cells or systemic acute phase responses.\n\n Postnatal dexamethasone or cortisol, at the doses tested, did not have important effects on lung function or injury, suggesting that corticosteroids given at birth will not decrease resuscitation mediated injury.\n\n\n","id":"PMC2802354","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"BioMed Central","authors":[{"firstname":"Noah

modification by family history of allergies – a population based cross-sectional study","abstract":"Background\nStudies on the association of birth by caesarean section (C/S) and allergies have produced conflicting findings.\n\n Furthermore, evidence on whether this association may differ in those at risk of atopy is limited.\n\n This study aims to investigate the association of mode of delivery with asthma and atopic sensitization and the extent to which any effect is modified by family history of allergies.\n\n\nMethods\nAsthma outcomes were assessed cross-sectionally in 2216 children at age 8 on the basis of parents’ responses to the ISAAC questionnaire whilst skin prick tests to eleven aeroallergens were also performed in a subgroup of 746 children.\n\n Adjusted odds ratios of asthma and atopy by mode of delivery were estimated in multivariable logistic models while evidence of effect modification was examined by introducing interaction terms in the models.\n\n\nResults\nAfter adjusting for potential confounders, children born by C/S appeared significantly more likely than those born vaginally to report ever wheezing (OR 1.36, 95% CI 1.07-1.71), asthma diagnosis (OR 1.41, 95% CI 1.09-1.83) and be atopic (OR 1.67, 95% CI 1.08-2.60).\n\n There was modest evidence that family history of allergies may modify the effect of C/S delivery on atopy (p for effect modification=0.06) but this was not the case for the asthma outcomes.\n\n Specifically, while more than a two-fold increase in the odds of being a topic was observed in children with a family history of allergies if born by C/S (OR 2.62, 95% CI 1.38-5.00), no association was observed in children without a family history of allergies (OR 1.16, 95% CI 0.64-2.11).\n\n\nConclusions\nBirth by C/S is associated with asthma and atopic sensitization in childhood.\n\n The association of C/S and atopy appears more pronounced in children with family history of allergies.\n\n\n","id":"PMC3511167","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"BioMed

neonatal insults: a systematic review","abstract":"Background\nNeonatal interventions are largely focused on reduction of mortality and progression towards Millennium Development Goal 4 (child survival).\n\n However, little is known about the global burden of long-term consequences of intrauterine and neonatal insults.\n\n We did a systematic review to estimate risks of long-term neurocognitive and other sequelae after intrauterine and neonatal insults, especially in low-income and middle-income countries.\n\n\nMethods\nWe searched Medline, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, the Cochrane Library, and Embase for studies published between Jan 1, 1966, and June 30, 2011, that reported neurodevelopmental sequelae after preterm or neonatal insult.\n\n For unpublished studies and grey literature, we searched Dissertation Abstracts International and the WHO library.\n\n We reviewed publications that had data for long-term outcome after defined neonatal insults.\n\n We summarised the results with medians and IQRs, and calculated the risk of at least one sequela after insult.\n\n\nFindings\nOf 28?212 studies identified by our search, 153 studies were suitable for inclusion, documenting 22?161 survivors of intrauterine or neonatal insults.\n\n The overall median risk of at least one sequela in any domain was 39·4% (IQR 20·0–54·8), with a risk of at least one severe impairment in any insult domain of 18·5% (7·7–33·3), of at least one moderate impairment of 5·0% (0·0–13·3%), and of at least one mild impairment of 10·0% (1·4–17·9%).\n\n The pooled risk estimate of at least one sequela (weighted mean) associated with one or more of the insults studied (excluding HIV) was 37·0% (95% CI 27·0–48·0%) and this risk was not significantly affected by region, duration of the follow-up, study design, or period of data collection.\n\n The most common sequelae were learning difficulties, cognition, or developmental delay (n=4032; 59%); cerebral palsy (n=1472; 21%); hearing impairment (n=1340; 20%); and visual impairment (n=1228; 18%).\n\n Only 40 (26%) studies included data for multidomain impairments.\n\n These studies included 2815 individuals, of whom 1048 (37%) had impairments, with 334 (32%) having multiple impairments.\n\n\nInterpretation\nIntrauterine and neonatal insults have a high risk of causing substantial long-term neurological morbidity.\n\n Comparable cohort studies in resource-poor regions should be done to properly assess the burden of these conditions, and long-term outcomes, such as chronic disease, and to inform policy and programme investments.\n\n\nFunding\nThe Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation, Saving Newborn Lives, and the Wellcome

injury in very preterm lambs","abstract":"Background\nBronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is closely associated with ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI) in very preterm infants.\n\n The greatest risk of VILI may be in the immediate period after birth, when the lungs are surfactant deficient, still partially filled with liquid and not uniformly aerated.\n\n However, there have been very few studies that have examined this immediate post-birth period and identified the initial injury-related pathways that are activated.\n\n We aimed to determine if the early response genes; connective tissue growth factor (CTGF), cysteine rich-61 (CYR61) and early growth response 1 (EGR1), were rapidly induced by VILI in preterm lambs and whether ventilation with different tidal volumes caused different inflammatory cytokine and early response gene expression.\n\n\nMethods\nTo identify early markers of VILI, preterm lambs (132 d gestational age; GA, term ~147 d) were resuscitated with an injurious ventilation strategy (VT 20 mL/kg for 15 min) then gently ventilated (5 mL/kg) for 15, 30, 60 or 120 min (n = 4 in each).\n\n To determine if early response genes and inflammatory cytokines were differentially regulated by different ventilation strategies, separate groups of preterm lambs (125 d GA; n = 5 in each) were ventilated from birth with a VT of 5 (VG5) or 10 mL/kg (VG10) for 135 minutes.\n\n Lung gene expression levels were compared to levels prior to ventilation in age-matched control fetuses.\n\n\nResults\nCTGF, CYR61 and EGR1 lung mRNA levels were increased ~25, 50 and 120-fold respectively (p &lt; 0.05), within 30 minutes of injurious ventilation.\n\n VG5 and VG10 caused significant increases in CTGF, CYR61, EGR1, IL1-?, IL-6 and IL-8 mRNA levels compared to control levels.\n\n CTGF, CYR61, IL-6 and IL-8 expression levels were higher in VG10 than VG5 lambs; although only the IL-6 and CYR61 mRNA levels reached significance.\n\n\nConclusion\nCTGF, CYR61 and EGR1 may be novel early markers of lung injury and mechanical ventilation from birth using relatively low tidal volumes may be less injurious than using higher tidal volumes.\n\n\n","id":"PMC2662809","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"BioMed Central","authors":[{"firstname":"Megan

Unprepared for this emergency, hospitals have quickly reformulated paths of assistance in an effort to guarantee treatment for infected patients. Orthopaedic departments have been focused on elderly traumatology, especially the treatment of femoral neck fractures in patients with coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19). The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the orthopaedic management strategy for femoral fragility fractures in COVID-19-positive patients with the hypothesis that operative treatment may contribute to the overall stability of the patient.\nMethods:\nSixteen patients affected by proximal femoral fracture and a recent history of fever, shortness of breath, and desaturation were admitted to the emergency room.

Ten patients underwent surgery on the day after admission, whereas 3 patients had suspended their use of direct thrombin inhibitors and needed surgery to be delayed until the third day after admission. In all patients except 1, we noted an improvement in terms of O2 saturation and assisted respiration. In 9 patients, hemodynamic and respiratory stability was observed at an average of 7 days postoperatively. Four patients who underwent surgical treatment died of respiratory failure on the first day after surgery (1 patient), the third day after surgery (2 patients), or the seventh day after surgery (1 patient).\nConclusions:\nWe noted a stabilization of respiratory parameters in 12 COVID-19-positive patients who underwent surgery treatment of proximal femoral fractures. We believe that in elderly patients with COVID-19 who have proximal femoral fractures, surgery may contribute to the overall stability of the patient, seated mobilization, improvement in physiological ventilation, and general patient comfort in bed.\nLevel of Evidence:\nPrognostic Level IV. See Instructions for Authors for a complete description of levels of evidence.\nFrom February to April 2020, the coronavirus SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome)-CoV-2 spread rapidly in northern Italy, resulting in a severe emergency for the national health-care system. Despite the best efforts of the health-care network of Lombardy to manage a large number of patients, the rapid spread of infection quickly led to a saturation of intensive-care units throughout the region. As of April 1, 2020, &gt;9,171 cases have been diagnosed in the city of Bergamo alone. In our hospital, Humanitas Gavazzeni of Bergamo (Lombardy, Italy), both medical and surgical activities have been rapidly reformulated and are key to maximizing assistance to patients affected by viral interstitial pneumonia as a result of SARS-CoV-2. The orthopaedic unit has been focused on elderly traumatology, especially the treatment of femoral neck fractures in patients with coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19). The diagnostic and therapeutic paths to be taken for these patients with fractures in the pandemic emergency setting have been organized as follows: surgical treatment within 24 hours in an attempt to stabilize the patient, reduction of blood loss, and improvement of respiratory function with the goal of minimizing the need for admittance to the intensive-care unit. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the orthopaedic management strategy for femoral fragility fractures in COVID-19-positive patients with the hypothesis that surgery may contribute to the overall stability of the patient.\nMaterials and Methods\nThe present study was conducted according to the STROBE (Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology) checklist for case series. Informed consent was obtained from all individual participants who were included in the study. Nineteen patients with an average age of 85 years (range, 74 to 90 years) were admitted to the emergency orthopaedic room for the treatment of a proximal femoral fracture; the fractures were classified as OTA/AO type 31-A1 (8 fractures; 42.1%), 31-A2 (5 fractures; 26.3%), 31-B2 (5 fractures; 26.3%), or 31-B33 (1 fracture; 5.3%). Three patients had no history of fever or respiratory symptoms and were excluded from the study. Sixteen patients had reported fever and shortness of breath 3 to 7 days before hospitalization, and all had accidentally fallen at home with no signs of head injury. All 16 patients presented with symptoms of fever and oxygen desaturation on ambient air; 14 of them needed respiratory support. Clinical features, comorbidities, and the type of assisted ventilation administered at the time of hospitalization for symptomatic patients are shown in Table I. All patients were tested with thoracic computed tomography (CT) screening and oropharyngeal swabs (Fig. 1). The 3 asymptomatic patients with no signs of interstitial pneumonia on the CT scan and no requirement for ventilatory support were promptly transferred to a clinic close to our hospital (Humanitas Gavazzeni, Bergamo, Italy), to which patients are usually assigned for same-day procedures or relief hospitalization, to await the result of the swab test before treatment.\nComorbidities, Type of Mechanical Ventilation, and O2 Saturation in ER in Patients with COVID-19 and Proximal Femoral Fractures\nCase	Sex, Age (yr)	Type of Fracture	Comorbidities	pO2 Saturation, Ventilation	 	1	F, 89	31-A1	Diabetes type IIHypertensionMitral insufficiency	96%, 4 L/min Venturi mask	 	2	F, 89	31-B2	Diabetes type IIHypertensionHypothyroidismDepressive anxiety syndrome	97%, 3 L/min Venturi mask	 	3	M, 84	31-B3	HypertensionIschemic cardiopathy	90%, 15 L/min Venturi mask	 	4	M, 84	31-A1	HypertensionHepatitis C	94%, 12 L/min Venturi mask	 	5	M, 90	31-A2	HypertensionIschemic cardiopathyChronic heart failure	90%, 6 L/min Venturi mask	 	6	F, 90	31-A2	HypertensionPrevious cerebral ischemiaVascular dementiaChronic heart failure	90%, 10 L/min Venturi mask	 	7	M, 74	31-A2	HypertensionObesityDepressive anxiety syndrome	94%, ambient air	 	8	M, 82	31-A1	Chronic kidney diseaseBenign prostatic hyperplasia	94%, ambient air	 	9	M, 86	31-A1	HypertensionHypothyroidism	96%, 10 L/min Venturi mask	 	10	M, 88	31-B2	Diabetes type IIIschemic cardiopathyBenign prostatic hyperplasia	94%, 6 L/min Venturi mask	 	11	M, 85	31-A2	Ischemic cardiopathyBenign prostatic hyperplasia	96%, 10 L/min Venturi mask	 	12	M, 82	31-B2	HypertensionPrevious cerebral ischemia	97%, 10 L/min Venturi mask	 	13	F, 85	31-B2	Depressive anxiety syndrome	94%, 6 L/min Venturi mask	 	14	F, 79	31-A1	HypertensionHypothyroidismObesity	96%, 10 L/min Venturi mask	 	15	F, 80	31-A1	Diabetes type II	97%, 10 L/min Venturi mask	 	16	M, 82	31-A2	Diabetes type IIChronic kidney disease	94%, 6 L/min Venturi mask	 	\nPreoperative CT scan showing bilateral patchy consolidation and multiple ground-glass opacities.\nSixteen patients with a positive result for interstitial pneumonia or related respiratory symptoms on CT scanning were hospitalized in our unit, and prophylaxis with low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH), standard hydration, hydroxychloroquine (200 mg x 2 per day), and azythromycin (500 mg x 2 per day) was administered according to our hospital's protocol for patients with COVID-19. Three patients died on the wards, before surgery, as a result of severe respiratory insufficiency and multiple-organ-failure syndrome (MOFS). For the other 13 patients, as per the recommendations of the anesthesiologists and trauma team, the criteria for surgery were a peripheral oxygen saturation (pO2) of &gt;90% and a body temperature of &lt;38 C. Ten patients were operatively treated on the first day, 12 to 24 hours after admission. Three patients had suspended their use of direct thrombin inhibitors and needed surgery to be delayed until the third day after recovery. According to our usual clinical practice, all patients received regional anesthesia, a combination of neuraxial anesthesia and a peripheral femoral block to avoid any type of sedation. We performed reduction and osteosynthesis with an intramedullary nail (Gamma3; Stryker) for lateral femoral neck fractures (Fig. 2) and with an endoprosthesis (Corail; DePuy Synthes) for medial femoral neck fractures, with an average operative time of 30 and 50 minutes, respectively. All patients were encouraged to assume the sitting position on a wheelchair or armchair on the first day postoperatively, and they were assisted by physiotherapists to improve physiological ventilation. Postoperative pain management was based on a non-opioid multimodal strategy, and blood loss was minimized by avoiding fluid overload and managing patients who had hemoglobin values of &lt;=9 g/dL with concentrated red blood-cell transfusion.\nAnteroposterior radiograph of the left hip, showing reduction and osteosynthesis with an intramedullary nail for the treatment of a lateral femoral neck fracture.\nResults\nAll of the operatively managed patients had a positive result on oropharyngeal swabs. In all patients except 1 (Case 4), we noted improved O2 saturation and assisted respiratory support. Detailed data on the outcomes on the first, third, and seventh days postoperatively are shown in Table II. Nine patients demonstrated hemodynamic and respiratory stability at an average of 7 days (range, 5 to 10 days) postoperatively. Two patients (Cases 1 and 2) were dismissed to a rehabilitation center to continue treatment for COVID-19. Four patients who underwent operative treatment died on the ward for respiratory failure on the first day after surgery (Case 9), the third day after surgery (Cases 8 and 13), or the seventh day after surgery (Case 10).\nO2 Saturation and Assisted Respiratory Support Before Surgery and on First, Third, and Seventh Days After Surgery\nPatient	Type of Surgery	pO2 Saturation, Ventilation	 	1st Postop.

In a pandemic emergency scenario, patient comorbidities and life expectancy play a key role in medical therapy decision-making. Femoral fracture in elderly patients is a life-threatening condition, and delayed surgical treatment may negatively affect the clinical course by prolonging pain and bed rest, increasing use of medication, and necessitating intensive care.\nCOVID-19 is a new pandemic disease that has spread rapidly in northern Italy since the first Italian case in the country was isolated on February 20, 2020. According to data provided by the Minister of Public Health of Italy, at the end of March 2020, &gt;80,000 people had tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 with &gt;36,000 cases being in the region of Lombardy. Our city of Bergamo and its metropolitan area still have the highest number of infections, with &gt;9,000 cases. Rapid saturation of intensive-care units and the associated demand for additional space is still the most challenging problem faced by hospital coordination units. Since the first cases of SARS-CoV-2 appeared in the region of Lombardy, our hospital promptly restructured paths of assistance to maximize hospitalization for patients with COVID-19. Our Orthopaedic and Traumatology Unit has suspended elective surgery. In accordance with the anesthesiology team, we created 2 management pathways for trauma cases. All trauma patients in the orthopaedic emergency room (ER) were screened with thoracic CT scans and oropharyngeal swabs. Patients with no recent history (&gt;3 weeks) of fever or upper respiratory tract symptoms and CT scans that were not suggestive of interstitial pneumonia were transferred to a clinic close to our hospital (Humanitas Gavazzeni of Bergamo). We believe that locating a clean spot to hospitalize trauma patients who test negative for infection may help to reduce the risk of contamination. Instead of a hospital, we selected a clinic close to our center. Patients sent to this clinic were initially isolated in a room until the results of the oropharyngeal swab were obtained and confirmed that they were COVID-19-negative. We did not find any positive swabs in asymptomatic patients with negative thoracic CT scans, and all negative cases were treated urgently. Patients with COVID-19-suggestive symptoms (including fever, headache, rough cough, anosmia, ageusia, shortness of breath, dyspnea, and positive CT thoracic scan for interstitial pneumonia) were hospitalized in our unit.\nAt the time of hospitalization, 14 elderly patients with proximal femoral fractures presented with dyspnea and desaturation and needed ventilation support with a Venturi mask.\nItalian epidemiological data collected by the Istituto Superiore di Sanita, the most important government agency on public health, revealed a mean age of 78 years (median, 79 years; range, 26 to 100 years) for patients dying from COVID-19 infection. Of those patients, 24.5% had 2 comorbidities and 51.7% had &gt;=3 preexisting diseases. Beyond ethical dilemmas, our main concern during our emergency was to reformulate pathways of assistance, ensuring &quot;COVID-free&quot; paths for elderly patients in need of orthopaedic surgery and establishing operability criteria for vulnerable elderly patients affected by COVID-19 (Fig. 3). The orthopaedic literature has confirmed that the advantages of early treatment of proximal femoral fractures in the elderly include promoting early movement, reducing bed rest, achieving better quality of life, controlling pain, and preventing blood loss and overall mortality. However, severe pneumonia and respiratory insufficiency may represent a contraindication to anesthetic and surgical procedures because of the associated high risk. We decided, as per recommendations of our anesthesiology team, to proceed with early surgery in patients with a pO2 of &gt;90% and a body temperature of &lt;38 C. Spinal anesthesia was used for all patients in order to avoid any type of sedation and was combined with a peripheral femoral nerve block to decrease opioid consumption and to achieve better pain management in the postoperative period.\nAlgorithm for the treatment of COVID-19-positive patients with a lateral femoral neck fracture.\nConclusions\nWe noted a stabilization of respiratory parameters in 12 COVID-19-positive patients who underwent surgery treatment of proximal femoral fractures. Despite early surgical treatment, 4 patients died. We believe that in elderly patients with COVID-19 who have proximal femoral fractures, surgery may contribute to the overall stability of the patient, seated mobilization, improvement in physiological ventilation, and general patient comfort in bed. Nevertheless, elderly patients with COVID-19 with comorbidities and a proximal femoral fracture, especially those with a critical clinical presentation in the ER such as severe dyspnea (pO2 &lt;90%), hyperpyrexia (&gt;38 C), and signs of systemic organ dysfunction, are in a life-threatening condition and are not eligible for orthopaedic surgery.\nInvestigation performed at Humanitas Gavazzeni, Bergamo, Italy\nDisclosure: The authors indicated that no external funding was received for any aspect of this work.

immunogenicity data about the vaccine candidate BNT162b1 in younger adults have been reported previously from trials in Germany and the United States.\n\n\nMethods\nIn an ongoing, placebo-controlled, observer-blinded, dose-escalation, phase 1 trial conducted in the United States, we randomly assigned healthy adults 18 to 55 years of age and those 65 to 85 years of age to receive either placebo or one of two lipid nanoparticle–formulated, nucleoside-modified RNA vaccine candidates: BNT162b1, which encodes a secreted trimerized SARS-CoV-2 receptor–binding domain; or BNT162b2, which encodes a membrane-anchored SARS-CoV-2 full-length spike, stabilized in the prefusion conformation.\n\n The primary outcome was safety (e.\n\ng.\n\n, local and systemic reactions and adverse events);

Proper patient transfer, medical staff access procedures, and effective biosafety precautions are important to protect medical staff from COVID-19.\nSince December 2019, a new severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) infection disease (COVID-19) has been reported. The outbreak originated in Wuhan before spreading throughout China and the rest of the world. COVID-19 is a contagious pulmonary infectious disease with respiratory symptoms similar to those seen in the previously reported SARS epidemic in 2003. Respiratory droplets and close contact transmission are the main routes of transmission. There is also a possibility of aerosol transmission in a relatively closed environment when exposed to high concentrations of aerosol for a protracted period of time. Parturients have relatively depressed immunity and could theoretically be at higher risk from infection of this virus. Thus, SARS-CoV-2 virus infection during pregnancy is reported to be a serious threat to pregnant women and their fetuses. Nevertheless, the clinical manifestations of SARS-CoV-2-infected parturients and their babies remains unknown.\nAs of January 2020, the Renmin hospital of Wuhan University has been designated as the diagnostic and treatment centre for pregnant women infected with SARS-CoV-2. Herein, we retrospectively review 17 cases of the SARS-CoV-2 infected pregnant women who underwent Cesarean delivery.\nMethods\nPatients and diagnosis\nThis study was approved by the Institutional Review Board at Renmin hospital of Wuhan University (No. WDRY2020-K077, 2 Feb 2020). Cases of pregnant women with COVID-19 who were admitted to Renmin hospital of Wuhan University from 30 January to 23 February 2020 were reviewed. After obtaining written informed consent, all clinical data were independently collected by two investigators. The diagnosis of COVID-19 followed the diagnostic criteria established by the New Coronavirus Pneumonia Prevention and Control Program (sixth edition) issued by the National Health Commission of China. Nasal swab samples from high-risk pregnant women and their newborns were tested for SARS-CoV-2 virus using a kit (BioGerm, Shanghai, China) according to the World Health Organization guidelines for reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) (also recommended by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention in Beijing, China). Chest computed tomography (CT) scans of all infected pregnant women were performed and reviewed as part of their pre-partum assessment. These scans were reviewed for the usual characteristic signs of COVID-19, including peripheral and/or sub-pleural ground-glass opacities.\nOperating room preparation, personnel entry and exit procedures, and medical staff protection\nAppropriate personnel protection equipment (PPE) was used in different zones of the operation room. Biosafety level-3 (BSL-3) protective medical equipment was worn during the operation, including N95 masks, goggles, protective suits, disposable medical caps, and medical rubber gloves. For care of the patients who received general anesthesia and endotracheal intubation, the anesthesiologist used a powered air-purifying respirator.\nParturients were transferred between the isolation ward and the operating room by a negative pressure isolation transfer cabin that can carry one patient over a short distance in a stretcher and stretcher vehicle, and were transported by staff wearing BSL-3 protective medical equipment. The parturients also wore regular surgical masks throughout the process to reduce viral spread.\nOverall layout design of surgical workspaces\nStandard operating procedures for dressing biosafety level 3 protective medical equipment\nStandard operating procedures for undressing biosafety level 3 grade protective wear\nNegative pressure operating rooms were used for Cesarean delivery of parturients with COVID-19. Medical personnel entered and exited the operating room in strict accordance with the principles of clean area, contaminated pollution area, and two buffer zones (Fig. 1). Designated nurses ensured the implementation of standard procedures (Figs 2 and 3).\nAfter the surgery, the anesthesia workstation was disinfected for two hours with an anesthesia circuit sterilizer (containing 12% hydrogen peroxide). Chlorine-containing disinfectant (2,000 mg L-1) was used to clean the operating room floor and wipe the surface of reusable medical equipment (including the anesthesia workstation and monitors). Reusable medical devices (including surgical instruments) were soaked for 30 min in 2,000 mg L-1 chlorine-containing disinfectant, then sealed and collected into double-layer disposable medical waste bags in the cleaning room and sent to the designated disinfection department by specialized staff. After the operating room was cleaned, the air purification system was shut down after 30 min of continuous operation of negative pressure laminar flow. Then, an ultra-low volume of 3% hydrogen peroxide (20-30 mL m-3) was used to closed fumigate the operating room for two hours. Finally, the negative pressure ventilation of the operating room was turned on again.\nAnesthesia, surgery, and perioperative management\nThe anesthesia informed consent was signed by the patient or her relative in the isolation ward or operating room to avoid the possibility of virus spread.\nRoutine monitoring (continuous non-invasive blood pressure, electrocardiograph, and pulse oximetry) was performed after the patient entered the operating room. Continuous epidural anesthesia or combined spinal-epidural anesthesia (CSE) was the first choice to avoid endotracheal intubation (which could induce or exacerbate pulmonary complications in parturients with COVID-19). General anesthesia was an option for cases of maternal or fetal emergencies, or for those patients with contraindications to epidural or CSE techniques, or if intrathecal anesthesia failed.\nConduct of epidural anesthesia\nThe L3-4 or L2-3 interspace was selected as the epidural puncture site. 2% lidocaine was used as both the test dose and loading dose; 0.75% ropivacaine was used for maintenance of epidural anesthesia. A sensory and motor block plane from T6-T8 segments to S4-5 was maintained during Cesarean delivery.\nConduct of general anesthesia\nFor cases needing general anesthetic for Cesarean delivery, preoxygenation was rapidly accomplished with four maximal capacity breaths with 100% oxygen. Rapid inhalation induction of general anesthesia consisted of 8% sevoflurane in 100% oxygen while cricoid pressure was continuously applied, and following two to three minutes of gentle positive pressure ventilation. This was followed by intravenous injections of 2% lidocaine (1-1.5 mg kg-1), remifentanil (1-2 mg kg-1) and succinylcholine choline (1-2 mg kg-1) to ensure optimal intubating conditions. Sevoflurane was used to maintain anesthesia before delivery, with sufentanil (0.25-0.35 mug kg-1) and an infusion of propofol (50-100 mug kg1 min-1) used to maintain anesthesia after delivery.\nOutcomes of both mothers and newborns\nAll parturients presenting to hospital were queried as to whether they had a history of exposure to, or were diagnosed with COVID-19 within the prior 14 days. The method of delivery, American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status score, arterial blood gases, operation time, estimated blood loss, postoperative visual analogue score (VAS) for pain, any need for analgesia within the first 48 postpartum hours, as well as maternal complications and outcomes were also recorded.\nAfter delivery, the newborns' oral cavity, nose, and face were wiped and cleaned immediately with a sterile towel. The newborns were then transferred to a radiant warmer bed in a cordoned-off area in the operating room. The Apgar score was assessed at one, five, and ten minutes after delivery. After ligation of the umbilical cord, newborns were sent to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) by specialized nurses and no further contact with infected mothers was allowed. A blood gas from the newborn was measured in NICU. A SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR viral test (nasal swab) for neonates was performed twice, first on the day after delivery and then again on the day before discharged. Neonatal mortality, severe asphyxia, NICU length of stay, and other clinical outcomes were also recorded.\nPostoperative evaluation of medical staff\nAll medical staff who were involved in the Cesarean delivery were required to have a SARS-CoV-2 virus detection test (RT-PCR of nasal swabs) and CT scans once every two weeks.\nData presentation\nData were presented as mean (standard deviation), median [interquartile range], or n (%). As the overall number of cases was relatively small, no inferential statistical analysis was undertaken.\nResults\nDemographic data\nDemographic data (n = 17)\n	Epidural anesthesia (n = 14)	General anesthesia (n = 3)	 	Age, yr	29.5 (3.1)	28.7 (1.6)	 	Height, cm	160.3 (2.4)	161.0 (1.7)	 	Weight, kg	65.6 (3.4)	65.7 (2.89)	 	Gestational age			 	 &lt; 37 weeks, n (%)	3 (21)	0	 	 &gt;= 37 weeks, n (%)	11 (79)	3 (100)	 	Coexisting disorders	8 (57)	0	 	 Anemia, n (%)	5 (36)	0	 	 Hypertension, n (%)	1 (7)	0	 	 Diabetes, n (%)	2 (14)	0	 	\nData are presented as mean (standard deviation) or n (%), as indicated\nAnemia is defined as hemoglobin level of &lt; 11 g L-1; Hypertension is defined as a systolic blood pressure &gt; 140 mmHg and/or a diastolic blood pressure &gt; 90 mmHg (average of at least two measurements taken at least 15 min apart); Diabetes is defined as fasting blood glucose concentration &gt; 7.0 mmol L-1 or two-hour blood glucose concentration &gt; 11.1 mmol L-1\n\nSeventeen parturients with COVID-19 were included in this study.

Two of them were doctors who had been in contact with SARS-CoV-2-positive patients, while one patient's husband worked at the HUANAN Seafood Wholesale Market (once considered to be the source of the COVID-19 outbreak). Four patients (24%) presented with a mild fever without chills and none had a high fever (temperature &gt; 39  C). Other symptoms included four patients (24%) with cough, one (6%) with fatigue, two (12%) with &quot;chest distress&quot;, one (6%) with overt dyspnea, and one (6%) with diarrhea (Table 2).\nFive parturients (29%) with COVID-19 had lymphopenia (&lt; 1.0 cells x 109 L-1). Seven patients (41%) had elevated concentrations of C-reactive protein (&gt; 10 mg L-1). All patients had a normal level of alanine transaminase, aspartic transaminase, blood urea nitrogen, and creatinine (Table 2). All 17 patients tested positive by RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 and presented with multiple patchy ground-glass opacities on chest CT scan.\nAnesthesia management and surgery\nAnesthesia management and surgery (n = 17)\n	Epidural anesthesia (n = 14)	General anesthesia (n = 3)	 	Method of delivery			 	 Elective Cesarean delivery, n (%)	14 (100)	0	 	 Emergency Cesarean delivery, n (%)	0	3 (100)	 	ASA physical status			 	  I, n (%)	0	0	 	  II, n (%)	13 (93)	3 (100)	 	  III, n (%)	1(7)	0	 	  IV, n (%)	0	0	 	  V, n (%)	0	0	 	Arterial blood gas analysis			 	 pH	7.36 (0.03)	7.33 (0.02)	 	 PaO2, mmHg	117 (98)	125 (92)	 	 PaCO2, mmHg	32 (3)	27 (4)	 	 HCO3, mmol L-1	18.9 (1.5)	20.4 (0.4)	 	 BE, mmol L-1	-5.4 (1.7)	-3.5 (0.7)	 	 K+, mmol L-1	4.0 (0.3)	4.1 (0.1)	 	 Na+, mmol L-1	135 (4)	136.0 (0)	 	 Glu, mmol L-1	7.1 (1.8)	6.3 (0.2)	 	 Hb, g L-1	116.1 (13.1)	118.3 (0.6)	 	Duration of operation, min	68 (13)	80 (20)	 	Blood loss, mL	307 (92)	300 (100)	 	Postoperative VAS	2 [1-4]	3 [2-4]	 	Occurrence of complications			 	 Hypotension, n (%)	12 (86)	0	 	Post-Cesarean delivery length of stay, day	10 (4)	8 (3)	 	Clinical outcomes			 	 Discharge from hospital, n (%)	12 (86)	2 (67)	 	 Recovered, n (%)	12 (86)	2 (67)	 	\nData are presented as mean (standard deviation), median [interquartile range], or n (%) as indicated.

Three patients (18%) received general anesthesia (with endotracheal intubation) and the other 14 patients (82%) received continuous epidural anesthesia. An overview of the intraoperative arterial blood gas of the parturients is shown in Table 3. Twelve of the parturients (86%) undergoing epidural anesthesia experienced a higher rate of intraoperative hypotension (systolic blood pressure &lt; 80% of baseline) than that in the general anesthesia group. Intraoperative hemodynamic parameters were not improved by left-lateral position, intravenous liquid loading, and/or vasoconstrictor treatment. There were no other apparent clinical differences in other measurements between the general and epidural anesthesia groups. Fourteen patients quickly recovered from COVID-19 and were discharged from hospital after six to 13 days in the hospital. The three patients remaining are still in the hospital as of 1 March 2020 recovering from their Cesarean delivery and COVID-19.\nNeonatal outcomes\nNeonatal outcomes (n = 17)\n	Epidural anesthesia (n = 14)	General anesthesia (n = 3)	 	Neonatal death, n (%)	0	0	 	Severe neonatal asphyxia, n (%)	0	0	 	Apgar score			 	 1 min	9 [8-9]	9 [7-9]	 	 5 min	10 [9-10]	10 [9-10]	 	 10 min	10 [9-10]	10 [9-10]	 	Birth weight, g	3,280 (330)	2,780 (180)	 	Low-birth weight (&lt; 2,500 g), n (%)	0	0	 	Neonatal acidosis (umbilical artery pH &lt; 7.2), n (%)	0	0	 	Arterial blood gas			 	 pH	7.36 (0.06)	7.35 (0.05)	 	 PaO2, mmHg	69 (16)	77 (3)	 	 PaCO2, mmHg	35 (7)	40 (4)	 	 HCO3, mmol L-1	19.9 (2.2)	21.2 (0. 5)	 	 Hb, g L-1	182.1 (8.2)	171.7 (11.6)	 	SARS-CoV-2 positive, n (%)	0	0	 	Duration of neonate ICU, hr	13 (6)	16 (2)	 	Clinical outcomes			 	 Discharge from hospital, n (%)	14 (100)	3 (100)	 	In the hospital, n (%)	0	0	 	\nData are presented as mean (standard deviation), median [interquartile range], or n (%) as indicated\nBE = base excess; Glu = glucose; Hb = hemoglobin; ICU = intensive care unit; SARS-CoV-2 = severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus\nAll mothers had a singleton pregnancy. No intrapartum death, neonatal death, or serious neonatal asphyxia was observed. Three neonates were born prematurely, but none had a birthweight &lt; 2,500 g (Table 4). The Apgar scores ranged from 7 to 9 at one minute and 9 to 10 at five minutes (Table 4). All neonates were admitted to the NICU for further care and all SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR tests were negative. All 17 neonates were eventually discharged from hospital. There were no apparent differences in any parameters of the neonates when comparing the epidural anesthesia group with the general anesthesia group.\nPost-evaluation of medical staff infection\nA total of 12 obstetricians, ten anesthesiologists, and 26 nurses were involved in the Cesarean deliveries. All medical staff used BSL-3 protective equipment during the operation. Thus far, none have been infected with the SARS-CoV-2 according to the RT-PCR testing and CT scan findings.\nDiscussion\nHerein we report 17 cases of parturients with COVID-19 having Cesarean delivery. All those patients presented with ground-glass opacities on chest CT scans and laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 positivity. Epidural or general anesthesia was safe and effective for surgical patients. Careful patient transfer along with medical staff effective biosafety precautions were likely important to protect medical staff from SARS-CoV-2 infection.\nClinical features of SARS-CoV-2 infection share some similarity with previous reports of SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome virus (MERS-CoV) infections. Most of those patients present with fever, dry cough, dyspnea, along with bilateral ground-glass opacities on chest CT scan, and patients with severe illness rapidly developed acute respiratory distress syndrome and required intensive care unit admission. Nevertheless, COVID-19 patients rarely developed gastrointestinal signs and symptoms, whereas about 20-25% of patients with MERS-CoV or SARS-CoV infection had diarrhea. In our experience, the 17 parturients with COVID-19 showed non-classical clinical characteristics. There were only two cases with chest distress and only one case with dyspnea. Nevertheless, none were hypoxemic or required supplemental oxygen prior to the operation. Nine of the parturients did not have typical symptoms such as fever and cough; instead they only showed abnormalities on the chest CT scan. These nine patients had only mild symptoms or were asymptomatic.\nIn this report, the proportion of maternal critical illness appeared much lower than the average proportion of SARS-CoV-2 infection in Wuhan. One of the reasons may be that patients had a reduced range of activity and had less chance of exposure to SARS-CoV-2 during late pregnancy. Two recent studies have also shown that SARS-CoV-2 virus has not been detected in amniotic fluid, cord blood, or breast milk of pregnant women infected with SARS-CoV-2. This may explain why all the neonates in this study were free from infection. Our result is also consistent with the observation that the incidence of disease and disease severity were lower in neonates than in adults during the SARS epidemic, which may be related to the difficulty of vertical transmission of coronavirus, proper handling at birth, and timely isolation of the neonate after birth. A recent study showed that in addition to the lung, SARS-CoV-2 targets other organs such as kidney and testicles. It cannot be ruled out that SARS-CoV-2 may have an impact on the placenta. Thus, to ensure the safety of the parturients and newborns, we chose to perform elective Cesarean delivery.\nAlthough we recommend elective Cesarean delivery, there is a paucity of data to drive these recommendations. The final choice for the delivery method needs to consider the parturient's condition, the wishes of the parturient, and the advice of the obstetrician. The potential for transfer of the virus to the fetus during vaginal delivery is not known. If there is intrauterine fetal distress caused by hypoxia and other reasons, emergency Cesarean delivery should be performed immediately. In this study, three parturients underwent emergency Cesarean delivery because of fetal stress.\nAlthough no adverse maternal or neonatal outcomes were observed, COVID-19 can cause quick deterioration of lung function, so the ideal timing of Cesarean delivery is still crucial to ensuring maternal and fetal safety. Although both neuraxial and general anesthesia have been safely reported in pregnancy, because the lung is the main target organ of the virus, the choice of anesthetic regimens for Cesarean delivery is critical for pregnant women with COVID-19. Therefore, we recommend that neuraxial anesthesia wherever possible, based on it reducing the possibility of exacerbating pulmonary complications due to intubation. In our study, 14 of 17 pregnant women underwent epidural anesthesia, the onset time of sensory and motor block, the degree of motor block, the height of sensation, and the quality of anesthesia appeared to be the same as those of non-infected pregnant women. Nevertheless, it was noted that 86% of parturients undergoing epidural anesthesia experienced intraoperative hypotension. Importantly, because of the short duration and the hemodynamic changes, no adverse end-organ damage was apparent. As for why there appeared to be significant hypotension, a recent study suggested that SARS-CoV-2 can bind with the angiotensin-converting enzyme II (ACE2) receptor. The key of SARS-CoV-2 infection is its S protein binding with ACE2 receptor. These studies imply that the circulatory system is highly susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection. General anesthesia was used in three of our SARS-CoV-2-infected parturients. General anesthesia did not have any adverse effects on the neonatal outcomes and mothers' recovery from COVID-19.\nSARS-CoV-2 is easily spread from person to person via various routes. Respiratory droplets and close contact transmission are the main routes of transmission. There is a possibility of aerosol transmission in a relatively closed environment when exposed to high concentrations of aerosol for a long time. To solve the safety issues such as environmental pollution and infection of medical staff with COVID-19, all medical staff involved in the operation need to be identified. They should be trained in proper infection control management procedures and have a thorough understanding of nosocomial infection control and risk factors for COVID-19. In this series of patients, no medical staff involved in the operation were infected with COVID-19. Several factors may have influenced this positive result. First, a specific patient negative pressure transfer vehicle and a dedicated negative pressure operating room were used to prevent the spread of the virus, and sterilization was performed after surgery. Second, patients and medical staff followed the established biosafety procedures when entering and leaving the operating room. Dedicated personnel wore protective equipment and infection control in the negative pressure anterior chamber and buffer room to improve efficiency. Third, parturients wore a surgical mask in case they coughed during tracheal intubation, and suctioning reduced the spread of respiratory droplets and aerosols.\nIn summary, our experience is that both epidural and general anesthesia are safe and effective for pregnant women and newborns. Nevertheless, the incidence of hypotension appeared to be significantly higher than normal during epidural anesthesia. A negative pressure operating room, proper patient transfer, medical staff access procedures, and effective biosafety precautions were also important to protect the medical staff from SARS-CoV-2 infection. This experience may be helpful in planning for further obstetric anesthetic management of COVID-19 patients, particularly if the infection progresses to pandemic status. \nPublisher's Note\nSpringer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.\nRong Chen and Yuan Zhang have contributed equally to this work.\nZhong-yuan Xia and Qing-tao Meng share senior authorship.\nReferences\nClinical course and outcomes of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia in Wuhan, China: a single-centered, retrospective, observational study\nClinical findings in a group of patients infected with the 2019 novel coronavirus (SARS-Cov-2) outside of Wuhan, China: retrospective case series\nClinical features of patients infected with 2019 novel coronavirus in Wuhan, China\nPractical recommendations for critical care and anesthesiology teams caring for novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) patients\nChest computed tomography images of early coronavirus disease (COVID-19)\nA major outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome in Hong Kong\nEpidemiological, demographic, and clinical characteristics of 47 cases of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus disease from Saudi Arabia: a descriptive study\nClinical characteristics of 138 hospitalized patients with 2019 novel coronavirus-infected pneumonia in Wuhan, China\nClinical characteristics and intrauterine vertical transmission potential of COVID-19 infection in nine pregnant women: a retrospective review of medical records\nVertical transmission of human coronavirus.

Demographic data, symptoms, laboratory values, comorbidities, treatments, and clinical outcomes were all collected.\n\n Data were compared between survivors and non-survivors.\n\n The primary outcome was 28-day mortality, as of Feb 9, 2020. Secondary outcomes included incidence of SARS-CoV-2-related acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and the proportion of patients requiring mechanical ventilation.\n\n\nFindings\nOf 710 patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, 52 critically ill adult patients were included.\n\n The mean age of the 52 patients was 59·7 (SD 13·3) years, 35 (67%) were men, 21 (40%) had chronic illness, 51 (98%) had

was not clear, the working group in Hangzhou contacted the doctor responsible for treating the patient for clarification.\n\n\nResults\nOf the 62 patients studied (median age 41 years), only one was admitted to an intensive care unit, and no patients died during the study.\n\n According to research, none of the infected patients in Zhejiang province were ever exposed to the Huanan seafood market, the original source of the virus; all studied cases were infected by human to human transmission.\n\n The most common symptoms at onset of illness were fever in 48 (77%) patients, cough in 50 (81%), expectoration in 35 (56%), headache in 21 (34%), myalgia or fatigue in 32 (52%), diarrhoea in 3 (8%), and haemoptysis in 2 (3%).\n\n Only two patients (3%) developed shortness of breath on admission.\n\n The median time from exposure to onset of illness was 4 days (interquartile range 3-5 days), and from onset of symptoms to first hospital admission was 2 (1-4) days.\n\n\nConclusion\nAs of early February 2020, compared with patients initially infected with SARS-Cov-2 in Wuhan, the symptoms of patients in Zhejiang province are relatively mild.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7224340","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"BMJ Publishing Group

associated with a novel coronavirus was reported in Wuhan city, Hubei province, China.\n\n Affected patients were geographically linked with a local wet market as a potential source.\n\n No data on person-to-person or nosocomial transmission have been published to date.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this study, we report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, radiological, and microbiological findings of five patients in a family cluster who presented with unexplained pneumonia after returning to Shenzhen, Guangdong province, China, after a visit to Wuhan, and an additional family member who did not travel to Wuhan.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of genetic sequences from these patients were done.\n\n\nFindings\nFrom Jan 10, 2020, we enrolled a family of six patients who travelled to Wuhan from Shenzhen between Dec 29, 2019 and Jan 4, 2020. Of six family members who travelled to Wuhan, five were identified as infected with the novel coronavirus.\n\n Additionally, one family member, who did not travel to Wuhan, became infected with the virus after several days of contact with four of the family members.\n\n None of the family members had contacts with Wuhan markets or animals, although two had visited a Wuhan hospital.\n\n Five family members (aged 36–66 years) presented with fever, upper or lower respiratory tract symptoms, or diarrhoea, or a combination of these 3–6 days after exposure.\n\n They presented to our hospital (The University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen) 6–10 days after symptom onset.\n\n They and one asymptomatic child (aged 10 years) had radiological ground-glass lung opacities.\n\n Older patients (aged &gt;60 years) had more systemic symptoms, extensive radiological ground-glass lung changes, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and increased C-reactive protein and lactate dehydrogenase levels.\n\n The nasopharyngeal or throat swabs of these six patients were negative for known respiratory microbes by point-of-care multiplex RT-PCR, but five patients (four adults and the child) were RT-PCR positive for genes encoding the internal RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and surface Spike protein of this novel coronavirus, which were confirmed by Sanger sequencing.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these five patients' RT-PCR amplicons and two full genomes by next-generation sequencing showed that this is a novel coronavirus, which is closest to the bat severe acute respiatory syndrome (SARS)-related coronaviruses found in Chinese horseshoe bats.\n\n\nInterpretation\nOur findings are consistent with person-to-person transmission of this novel coronavirus in hospital and family settings, and the reports of infected travellers in other geographical regions.\n\n\nFunding\nThe Shaw Foundation Hong Kong, Michael Seak-Kan Tong, Respiratory Viral Research Foundation Limited, Hui

Coronavirus–Infected Pneumonia","abstract":"Background\nThe initial cases of novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV)–infected pneumonia (NCIP) occurred in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, in December 2019 and January 2020. We analyzed data on the first 425 confirmed cases in Wuhan to determine the epidemiologic characteristics of NCIP.\n\n\nMethods\nWe collected information on demographic characteristics, exposure history, and illness timelines of laboratory-confirmed cases of NCIP that had been reported by January 22, 2020. We described characteristics of the cases and estimated the key epidemiologic time-delay distributions.\n\n In the early period of exponential growth, we estimated the epidemic doubling time and the basic reproductive number.\n\n\nResults\nAmong the first 425 patients with confirmed NCIP, the median age was 59 years and 56% were male.\n\n The majority of cases (55%) with onset before January 1, 2020, were linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, as compared with 8.6% of the subsequent cases.\n\n The mean incubation period was 5.2 days (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.1 to 7.0), with the 95th percentile of the distribution at 12.5 days.\n\n In its early stages, the epidemic doubled in size every 7.4 days.\n\n With a mean serial interval of 7.5 days (95% CI, 5.3 to 19), the basic reproductive number was estimated to be 2.2 (95% CI, 1.4 to 3.9).\n\n\nConclusions\nOn the basis of this information, there is evidence that human-to-human transmission has occurred among close contacts since the middle of December 2019. Considerable efforts to reduce transmission will be required to control outbreaks if similar dynamics apply elsewhere.\n\n Measures to prevent or reduce transmission should be implemented in populations at risk.\n\n (Funded by the Ministry of Science and Technology of China and others.\n\n)\n","id":"PMC7121484","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Massachusetts Medical

2019 novel coronavirus: implications for virus origins and receptor binding","abstract":"Background\nIn late December, 2019, patients presenting with viral pneumonia due to an unidentified microbial agent were reported in Wuhan, China.\n\n A novel coronavirus was subsequently identified as the causative pathogen, provisionally named 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).\n\n As of Jan 26, 2020, more than 2000 cases of 2019-nCoV infection have been confirmed, most of which involved people living in or visiting Wuhan, and human-to-human transmission has been confirmed.\n\n\nMethods\nWe did next-generation sequencing of samples from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and cultured isolates from nine inpatients, eight of whom had visited the Huanan seafood market in Wuhan.\n\n Complete and partial 2019-nCoV genome sequences were obtained from these individuals.\n\n Viral contigs were connected using Sanger sequencing to obtain the full-length genomes, with the terminal regions determined by rapid amplification of cDNA ends.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these 2019-nCoV genomes and those of other coronaviruses was used to determine the evolutionary history of the virus and help infer its likely origin.\n\n Homology modelling was done to explore the likely receptor-binding properties of the virus.\n\n\nFindings\nThe ten genome sequences of 2019-nCoV obtained from the nine patients were extremely similar, exhibiting more than 99·98% sequence identity.\n\n Notably, 2019-nCoV was closely related (with 88% identity) to two bat-derived severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-like coronaviruses, bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21, collected in 2018 in Zhoushan, eastern China, but were more distant from SARS-CoV (about 79%) and MERS-CoV (about 50%).\n\n Phylogenetic analysis revealed that 2019-nCoV fell within the subgenus Sarbecovirus of the genus Betacoronavirus, with a relatively long branch length to its closest relatives bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21, and was genetically distinct from SARS-CoV.\n\n Notably, homology modelling revealed that 2019-nCoV had a similar receptor-binding domain structure to that of SARS-CoV, despite amino acid variation at some key residues.\n\n\nInterpretation\n2019-nCoV is sufficiently divergent from SARS-CoV to be considered a new human-infecting betacoronavirus.\n\n Although our phylogenetic analysis suggests that bats might be the original host of this virus, an animal sold at the seafood market in Wuhan might represent an intermediate host facilitating the emergence of the virus in humans.\n\n Importantly, structural analysis suggests that 2019-nCoV might be able to bind to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor in humans.\n\n The future evolution, adaptation, and spread of this virus warrant urgent investigation.\n\n\nFunding\nNational Key Research and Development Program of China, National Major Project for Control and Prevention of Infectious Disease in China, Chinese Academy of

phylogenetic analyses.\n\n\nMethods\nWe report data for a patient who was admitted to the Klinikum Schwabing (Munich, Germany) for severe acute respiratory infection.\n\n We did diagnostic RT-PCR and indirect immunofluorescence.\n\n From time of diagnosis, respiratory, faecal, and urine samples were obtained for virus quantification.\n\n We constructed a maximum likelihood tree of the five available complete MERS-CoV genomes.\n\n\nFindings\nA 73-year-old man from Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates, was transferred to Klinikum Schwabing on March 19, 2013, on day 11 of illness.\n\n He had been diagnosed with multiple myeloma in 2008, and had received several lines of treatment.\n\n The patient died on day 18, due to septic shock.\n\n MERS-CoV was detected in two samples of bronchoalveolar fluid.\n\n Viral loads were highest in samples from the lower respiratory tract (up to 1·2?×?106 copies per mL).\n\n Maximum virus concentration in urine samples was 2691 RNA copies per mL on day 13; the virus was not present in the urine after renal failure on day 14. Stool samples obtained on days 12 and 16 contained the virus, with up to 1031 RNA copies per g (close to the lowest detection limit of the assay).\n\n One of two oronasal swabs obtained on day 16 were positive, but yielded little viral RNA (5370 copies per mL).\n\n No virus was detected in blood.\n\n The full virus genome was combined with four other available full genome sequences in a maximum likelihood phylogeny, correlating branch lengths with dates of isolation.\n\n The time of the common ancestor was halfway through 2011. Addition of novel genome data from an unlinked case treated 6 months previously in Essen, Germany, showed a clustering of viruses derived from Qatar and the United Arab

coronavirus: estimation of pandemic risk","abstract":"Background\nThe new Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection shares many clinical, epidemiological, and virological similarities with that of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV.\n\n We aimed to estimate virus transmissibility and the epidemic potential of MERS-CoV, and to compare the results with similar findings obtained for prepandemic SARS.\n\n\nMethods\nWe retrieved data for MERS-CoV clusters from the WHO summary and subsequent reports, and published descriptions of cases, and took into account 55 of the 64 laboratory-confirmed cases of MERS-CoV reported as of June 21, 2013, excluding cases notified in the previous 2 weeks.\n\n To assess the interhuman transmissibility of MERS-CoV, we used Bayesian analysis to estimate the basic reproduction number (R0) and compared it to that of prepandemic SARS.\n\n We considered two scenarios, depending on the interpretation of the MERS-CoV cluster-size data.\n\n\nResults\nWith our most pessimistic scenario (scenario 2), we estimated MERS-CoV R0 to be 0·69 (95% CI 0·50–0·92); by contrast, the R0 for prepandemic SARS-CoV was 0·80 (0·54–1·13).\n\n Our optimistic scenario (scenario 1) yielded a MERS-CoV R0 of 0·60 (0·42–0·80).\n\n Because of recent implementation of effective contact tracing and isolation procedures, further MERS-CoV transmission data might no longer describe an entire cluster, but only secondary infections directly caused by the index patient.\n\n Hence, we calculated that, under scenario 2, eight or more secondary infections caused by the next index patient would translate into a 5% or higher chance that the revised MERS-CoV R0 would exceed 1—ie, that MERS-CoV might have pandemic potential.\n\n\nInterpretation\nOur analysis suggests that MERS-CoV does not yet have pandemic potential.\n\n We recommend enhanced surveillance, active contact tracing, and vigorous searches for the MERS-CoV animal hosts and transmission routes to human beings.\n\n\nFunding\nAgence Nationale de la Recherche (Labex Integrative Biology of Emerging Infectious Diseases), and the European Community's

retrospective review of medical records","abstract":"Background\nPrevious studies on the pneumonia outbreak caused by the 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) were based on information from the general population.\n\n Limited data are available for pregnant women with COVID-19 pneumonia.\n\n This study aimed to evaluate the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 in pregnancy and the intrauterine vertical transmission potential of COVID-19 infection.\n\n\nMethods\nClinical records, laboratory results, and chest CT scans were retrospectively reviewed for nine pregnant women with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia (ie, with maternal throat swab samples that were positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 [SARS-CoV-2]) who were admitted to Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, China, from Jan 20 to Jan 31, 2020. Evidence of intrauterine vertical transmission was assessed by testing for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in amniotic fluid, cord blood, and neonatal throat swab samples.\n\n Breastmilk samples were also collected and tested from patients after the first lactation.\n\n\nFindings\nAll nine patients had a caesarean section in their third trimester.\n\n Seven patients presented with a fever.\n\n Other symptoms, including cough (in four of nine patients), myalgia (in three), sore throat (in two), and malaise (in two), were also observed.\n\n Fetal distress was monitored in two cases.\n\n Five of nine patients had lymphopenia (&lt;1·0?×?10? cells per L).\n\n Three patients had increased aminotransferase concentrations.\n\n None of the patients developed severe COVID-19 pneumonia or died, as of Feb 4, 2020. Nine livebirths were recorded.\n\n No neonatal asphyxia was observed in newborn babies.\n\n All nine livebirths had a 1-min Apgar score of 8–9 and a 5-min Apgar score of 9–10. Amniotic fluid, cord blood, neonatal throat swab, and breastmilk samples from six patients were tested for SARS-CoV-2, and all samples tested negative for the virus.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe clinical characteristics of COVID-19 pneumonia in pregnant women were similar to those reported for non-pregnant adult patients who developed COVID-19 pneumonia.\n\n Findings from this small group of cases suggest that there is currently no evidence for intrauterine infection caused by vertical transmission in women who develop COVID-19 pneumonia in late pregnancy.\n\n\nFunding\nHubei Science and

novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).\n\n We report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatment and clinical outcomes of these patients.\n\n\nMethods\nAll patients with suspected 2019-nCoV were admitted to a designated hospital in Wuhan.\n\n We prospectively collected and analysed data on patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection by real-time RT-PCR and next-generation sequencing.\n\n Data were obtained with standardised data collection forms shared by WHO and the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium from electronic medical records.\n\n Researchers also directly communicated with patients or their families to ascertain epidemiological and symptom data.\n\n Outcomes were also compared between patients who had been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and those who had not.\n\n\nFindings\nBy Jan 2, 2020, 41 admitted hospital patients had been identified as having laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection.\n\n Most of the infected patients were men (30 [73%] of 41); less than half had underlying diseases (13 [32%]), including diabetes (eight [20%]), hypertension

binding","abstract":"Background\nIn late December, 2019, patients presenting with viral pneumonia due to an unidentified microbial agent were reported in Wuhan, China.\n\n A novel coronavirus was subsequently identified as the causative pathogen, provisionally named 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).\n\n As of Jan 26, 2020, more than 2000 cases of 2019-nCoV infection have been confirmed, most of which involved people living in or visiting Wuhan, and human-to-human transmission has been confirmed.\n\n\nMethods\nWe did next-generation sequencing of samples from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and cultured isolates from nine inpatients, eight of whom had visited the Huanan seafood market in Wuhan.\n\n Complete and partial 2019-nCoV genome sequences were obtained from these individuals.\n\n Viral contigs were connected using Sanger sequencing to obtain the full-length genomes, with the terminal regions determined by rapid amplification of cDNA ends.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these 2019-nCoV genomes and those of other coronaviruses was used to determine the evolutionary history of the virus and help infer its likely origin.\n\n Homology modelling was done to explore the likely receptor-binding properties of the virus.\n\n\nFindings\nThe ten genome sequences of 2019-nCoV obtained from the nine patients were extremely similar, exhibiting more than 99·98% sequence identity.\n\n Notably, 2019-nCoV was closely related (with 88% identity) to two bat-derived severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-like coronaviruses, bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21, collected in 2018 in Zhoushan, eastern China, but were more distant from SARS-CoV (about 79%) and MERS-CoV (about 50%).\n\n Phylogenetic analysis revealed that 2019-nCoV fell within the subgenus Sarbecovirus of the genus Betacoronavirus, with a relatively long branch length to its closest relatives bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21, and was genetically distinct from SARS-CoV.\n\n Notably, homology modelling revealed that 2019-nCoV had a similar receptor-binding domain structure to that of SARS-CoV, despite amino acid variation at some key residues.\n\n\nInterpretation\n2019-nCoV is sufficiently divergent

familial cluster of pneumonia associated with the 2019 novel coronavirus indicating person-to-person transmission: a study of a family cluster","abstract":"Background\nAn ongoing outbreak of pneumonia associated with a novel coronavirus was reported in Wuhan city, Hubei province, China.\n\n Affected patients were geographically linked with a local wet market as a potential source.\n\n No data on person-to-person or nosocomial transmission have been published to date.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this study, we report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, radiological, and microbiological findings of five patients in a family cluster who presented with unexplained pneumonia after returning to Shenzhen, Guangdong province, China, after a visit to Wuhan, and an additional family member who did not travel to Wuhan.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of genetic sequences from these patients were done.\n\n\nFindings\nFrom Jan 10, 2020, we enrolled a family of six patients who travelled to Wuhan from Shenzhen between Dec 29, 2019 and Jan 4, 2020. Of six family members who travelled to Wuhan, five were identified as infected with the novel coronavirus.\n\n Additionally, one family member, who did not travel to Wuhan, became infected with the virus after several days of contact with four of the family members.\n\n None of the family members had contacts with Wuhan markets or animals, although two had visited a Wuhan hospital.\n\n Five family members (aged 36–66 years) presented with fever, upper or lower respiratory tract symptoms, or diarrhoea, or a combination of these 3–6 days after exposure.\n\n They presented to our hospital (The University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen) 6–10 days after symptom onset.\n\n They and one asymptomatic child (aged 10 years) had radiological ground-glass lung opacities.\n\n Older patients (aged &gt;60 years) had more systemic symptoms, extensive radiological ground-glass lung changes, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and increased C-reactive protein and lactate dehydrogenase levels.\n\n The nasopharyngeal or throat swabs of these six patients were negative for known respiratory microbes by point-of-care multiplex RT-PCR, but five patients (four adults and the child) were RT-PCR positive for genes encoding the internal RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and surface Spike protein of this novel coronavirus, which were confirmed by Sanger sequencing.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these five patients' RT-PCR amplicons and two full genomes by next-generation sequencing showed that this is a novel coronavirus, which is closest to the bat severe acute respiatory syndrome (SARS)-related coronaviruses found in Chinese horseshoe bats.\n\n\nInterpretation\nOur findings are consistent with person-to-person transmission of this novel coronavirus in hospital and family settings, and the reports of infected travellers in other geographical regions.\n\n\nFunding\nThe Shaw Foundation Hong Kong, Michael Seak-Kan Tong, Respiratory Viral Research Foundation Limited, Hui

novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).\n\n We report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatment and clinical outcomes of these patients.\n\n\nMethods\nAll patients with suspected 2019-nCoV were admitted to a designated hospital in Wuhan.\n\n We prospectively collected and analysed data on patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection by real-time RT-PCR and next-generation sequencing.\n\n Data were obtained with standardised data collection forms shared by WHO and the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium from electronic medical records.\n\n Researchers also directly communicated with patients or their families to ascertain epidemiological and symptom data.\n\n Outcomes were also compared between patients who had been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and those who had not.\n\n\nFindings\nBy Jan 2, 2020, 41 admitted hospital patients had been identified as having laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection.\n\n Most of the infected patients were men (30 [73%] of 41); less than half had underlying diseases (13 [32%]), including diabetes (eight [20%]), hypertension (six [15%]), and cardiovascular disease (six [15%]).\n\n Median age was 49·0 years (IQR 41·0–58·0).\n\n 27 (66%) of 41 patients had been exposed to Huanan seafood market.\n\n One family cluster was

case report and literature review\nAn outbreak of novel coronavirus pneumonia occurred worldwide since December 2019, which had been named COVID-19 subsequently. It is extremely transmissive that infection in pregnant women were unavoidable. The delivery process will produce large amount of contaminated media, leaving a challenge for medical personnel to ensure both the safety of the mother and infant and good self-protection. Only rare cases of pregnant women with COVID-19 are available for reference. Here, we report a 30-year-old woman had reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction-confirmed COVID-19 at 36 weeks 2 days of gestation. Significant low and high variability of fetal heart rate baseline and severe variable decelerations were repeated after admission. An emergency cesarean section at 37 weeks 1 day of gestation under combined spinal and epidural anesthesia was performed with strict protection for all personnel. Anesthesia and operation went uneventfully. None of the participants were infected. We can conclude that when confronted with cesarean section in parturient with COVID-19, careful planning and detailed preparation can improve the safety of the mother and infant and reduce the risk of infection for medical staff to help preventing and controlling the epidemic.\nBackground\nIn early December 2019, a cluster of cases of pneumonia of a newly identified coronavirus was noted in Wuhan in China. The infection spread rapidly across the world. The coronavirus was initially termed 2019-nCoV and subsequently SARS-CoV-2, producing a disease that had been termed COVID-19. The novel coronavirus 2019 epidemic was characterized as a pandemic on WHO Director-General's opening remarks at the media briefing. It is certain that 2019-nCoV will infect parturients in such a cruel situation.\nPatients of mild COVID-19 may present with fever, fatigue, dry cough, but severe infection may progress rapidly to acute respiratory distress syndrome, septic shock, intractable acidosis and coagulopathy. Parturient with COVID-19 will make the disease more complicated, because the effects of maternal infection on the fetus and childbirth must be examined.\nKinds of infectious agents such as blood, amniotic fluid, and other body fluids are generated during cesarean section, creating a challenge for healthcare workers of keeping the mother and neonate safe while protecting themself against infection. However, there are few reports available for reference on exact anesthesia design for pregnant women confirmed with COVID-19. Here, we report a COVID-19-confirmed case of parturient in our institution, providing full details about the anesthesia process of emergency cesarean section.\nCase report\nThis patient consented to publication of the case and signed written informed consent. A 30-year-old, gravida 2, para 2 woman(163 cm, 75 kg) who had reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)-confirmed COVID-19 at 36 weeks 2 days of gestation without obstetric comorbidities was transferred from the local hospital to our institution. The patient was screened positive and hospitalized, secondary to her father-in-law was diagnosed with COVID-19. She was reported fever and occasional cough. Diagnosis of mild COVID-19 was made based on symptoms and pathogen inspection.\nChest imaging of the parturient. a X-ray showed the weight gain of the lungs and b computed tomography showed no abnormal density in the lungs\nThe patient was enclosed in an isolation ward of the fever unit in our hospital after admission. Pharyngeal swab specimens were collected and SARS-CoV-2 was detected through RT-PCR again. The laboratory test results showed a leukocyte count of 13.73 x 109/L with neutrophil 91% and lymphocyte 5.9%. Chest X-ray and computed tomography scan showed that the texture of both lungs increased, and no obvious exudation shadows were seen (Fig. 1). Nonstress test results of reactive type and ultrasound examination of placenta level 1 indicated intrauterine fetal health. However, significant variability of fetal heart rate baseline with the lowest 90-100 beats/min for 1 min and the highest 180-200 beats/min for about 3 min and severe variable decelerations occurred repeatedly on the third day of admission. Obstetric experts speculated that the patient could not deliver vaginally quickly and the termination of parturient by cesarean section was inevitable. Furthermore, multidisciplinary team, which consisted of departments of anesthesiology, obstetrics/gynecology, infectious disease, respiratory medicine and neonatology, finally decided that an emergency cesarean section was the most beneficial mode of delivery for both mother and the fetus.\nSurgery under strict protection. Negative pressure transfer vehicle-mounted patients entered the operating room (a); appearance of the negative pressure transfer device, the red arrow refers to the body of negative pressure chamber, the yellow arrow to the waterproof sealed zipper and the blue arrow to the transfer vehicle part (b); strictly protected anesthesiologist was performing spinal canal puncture (c); the midwife was transferring the newborn to the incubator (d)\nA large amount of body fluids containing SARS-Cov-2 would generate during the operation, so we had very strict protective measures. The patient wearing an N95 mask and lying in a negative pressure transfer vehicle was sent through a designated channel to a negative pressure operating room that had been tested in advance (Fig. 2a). The negative pressure transfer vehicle consists of a transfer vehicle and a negative pressure chamber which is made of high-strength transparent material with waterproof sealed zipper and used for the transportation of patients with respiratory infectious diseases such as SARS because it can produce a negative pressure of at least 15 Pa within 2 min and its filtration of aerosol particles of 0.3 mum is greater than 99.99% (Fig. 2b). All participants equipped with droplets, contact and airborne precautions performed an emergency section at 37 weeks 1 day of gestation under combined spinal and epidural anesthesia (CSEA).\nAnesthesia-related personnel hold emergency pre-anesthesia seminar to determine the exact anesthesia method and duties of tertiary anesthesiologist. A resident anesthesiologist who was ready to help outside the operating room was responsible for all the anesthesia preparation involving first-aid appliance, anesthetics, consumable items, anesthetic equipment; an experienced attending anesthesiologist performed CSEA separately and was in charge of intraoperative management; a chief anesthesiologist was located in the clean corridor to provide rescue in case of critical situation. The parturient was picked up after all personnel finished safeguard procedures and arrived at the predetermined position. The passageway where the patient got through was immediately sprayed with a disinfectant containing chlorine (500 mg/L chlorine dioxide solution) to kill the virus.\nWe provided emotional comfort to the anxious parturient. Her baseline blood pressure and heart rate were 121/74 mmHg and 94 beats/min, respectively. SpO2 was 96% (inhaled air). She was positioned in the right lateral decubitus position, and epidural anesthesia was attempted with an 18-gauge Tuohy needle via the median approach at L3-4. The loss-of-resistance technique was utilized to detect the epidural space. The dura mater was punctured with a 25-gauge pen-type spinal anesthesia needle through the channel of the Tuohy needle and ropivacaine (1.5 mL 0.75% ropivacaine and 1.5 mL cerebrospinal fluid dilution) was injected (Fig. 2c, d). After that, a 20-gauge nylon epidural catheter was threaded 4 cm towards head inside the epidural space in case additional local anesthetics were needed. Anesthesia was assessed bilaterally using cold and light touch, and a T6 block was reached after 5 min. The cesarean section was performed uneventfully without discomfort or poor muscle relaxation. The neonate was 2730 g, with Apgar score at 1 and 5 min of 7 and 9, respectively.\nThe patient referred back to the isolation ward accompanied by the attending anesthesiologist after surgery. The neonate was not infected. Both of them were discharged smoothly at day 5 postoperatively after SARS-CoV-2 detection of maternal pharyngeal swab specimen turned negative. All the surgical participants were directed to the designated hotel for isolation following a planned route after the cesarean section. SARS-CoV-2 detection and chest computed tomography were used for COVID-19 screening after 14 days. The participating medical staff had been released from quarantine and none of them was infected.\nDiscussion\nWe performed an emergency cesarean section in a patient with a highly infectious respiratory viral pathogenic disease. The multidisciplinary team worked together to formulate detailed plans and make sufficient preparations, leading to the uneventful completion of the operation under CSEA, safe the mother and the newborn, and zero infection for medical staff.\nThe reasons we preferred CSEA were as follows: first, although fetal heart rate (FHR) monitoring indicated that FHR was 120-140 beats/min with severe variable deceleration, it could be improved by the parturient lying on the left side and inhaling oxygen so we had ample time to perform the CSEA. Second, spinal anesthesia was superior to general anesthesia in reducing maternal and neonatal complications compared with general anesthesia. Finally, tracheal intubation was one of the operations with the highest risk of respiratory virus-borne disease infection, which could generate a large amount of virus-containing aerosols, droplets, sputum, etc. CSEA was conducted by an experienced attending anesthesiologist with skilled operation to shorten the virus exposure time.\nCOVID-19 spread very rapidly. It was declared a global pandemic by WHO, which neither previous SARS nor MERS could be considered. It might transmit through droplets, contact and respiratory aerosols within short-range during the cesarean section. Although the mother did not have obvious hypoxia and dyspnea, the newborn had mild neonatal asphyxia in the absence of premature delivery, amniotic fluid pollution, umbilical cord torsion, and placental disease. It could be assumed that COVID-19 could also have adverse effects on the fetus even if the mother's condition was relatively mild.\nSummary of delivery cases of pregnant women with coronavirus infection\nCase	Study (Year)	Coronavirus	Manifestation	Gestation age on birth /delivery way	Infection at birth	Maternal/infant outcome	Simulation /protection	Anesthesia details	Staff infection	 	1	Robert et al.

MERS, Middle East Respiratory Syndromes\nThis patient brought us such a challenge, how could we not only ensure the security of the mother and fetus, but also protect ourselves from being infected. We reviewed related literature in PUBMED (Table 1) on April 16, 2020 only to find a case report which provided details of cesarean section anesthesia for a parturient with MERS and another case report emphasizing mainly on the key points of anesthesia for emergency cesarean section of parturient confirmed with COVID-19. Besides, parturient with MERS in the case report had been full recovery before surgery while our patient was undergoing infection during operation and was highly contagious; there is no mention of the importance of preparation and teamwork which is the heart of our effort in the case report of cesarean section with COVID-19. Case 4 mentioned that a nurse got infected with unprotected exposure of 50 cm for 2 min when she was caring for a pregnant woman with MERS infection, which alerted us medical personnel would be infected with a little carelessness.\nOperation flowchart before admission, and on the day of cesarean section\nThe desired outcome was due to our thoughtful plan and full preparation. We had prepared a lot for this. The specific process and details are given in Fig. 3. The most noteworthy point was numerous scenario simulation exercises of COVID-19 cesarean section, which impressed us deeply on the specific process and promoted improvement of details, which made us sophisticated and calm when we actually faced the infected patient, along with good communication and coordination of all involved departments.\nOur cesarean section details indeed filled some of the blanks in the clinical anesthesia of COVID-19 pregnant women. However, there is still no experience on COVID-19 associated with severe infection, extreme fetal distress, or infection during the second trimester of parturient. How to ensure the safety of mothers, infants and healthcare workers in complex situations has yet to be explored.\nConclusion\nConfronted with a cesarean section which owns a high risk of infection, a thorough anesthesia plan, comprehensive pre-anesthesia preparation and tacit multidisciplinary cooperation can improve the safety of mothers and infants, and reduce the risk of infection of medical staff, conducive to epidemic prevention and control. COVID-19 patients with life-threatening situation and obstetric comorbidities need more experience accumulation of cesarean section anesthesia.\nPublisher's Note\nSpringer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.\nAuthor contributions\nSpecific details of anesthesia and surgery was provided by LW.

person-to-person or nosocomial transmission have been published to date.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this study, we report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, radiological, and microbiological findings of five patients in a family cluster who presented with unexplained pneumonia after returning to Shenzhen, Guangdong province, China, after a visit to Wuhan, and an additional family member who did not

Of six family members who travelled to Wuhan, five were identified as infected with the novel coronavirus.\n\n Additionally, one family member, who did not travel to Wuhan, became infected with the virus after several days of contact with four of the family members.\n\n None of the family members had contacts with Wuhan markets or animals, although two had visited a Wuhan hospital.\n\n Five family members (aged 36–66 years) presented with fever, upper or lower respiratory tract symptoms, or diarrhoea, or a combination of these 3–6 days after exposure.\n\n They presented to our hospital (The University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen) 6–10 days after symptom onset.\n\n They and one asymptomatic child (aged 10 years) had radiological ground-glass lung opacities.\n\n Older patients (aged &gt;60 years) had more systemic symptoms, extensive radiological ground-glass lung changes, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and increased C-reactive protein and lactate dehydrogenase levels.\n\n The nasopharyngeal or throat swabs of these six patients were negative for known respiratory microbes by point-of-care multiplex RT-PCR, but five patients (four adults and the child) were RT-PCR positive for genes encoding the internal RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and surface Spike protein of this novel coronavirus, which were confirmed by Sanger sequencing.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these five patients' RT-PCR amplicons and two full genomes by next-generation sequencing showed that this is a novel coronavirus, which is closest to the bat severe acute respiatory syndrome

outcomes in patients with a number of different malignancies.\n\n The objective of this study was to assess the relationship between NLR and mortality in a population of adult critically ill patients.\n\n\nMethods\nWe performed an observational cohort study of unselected intensive care unit (ICU) patients based on records in a large clinical database.\n\n We computed individual patient NLR and categorized patients by quartile of this ratio.\n\n The association of NLR quartiles and 28-day mortality was assessed using multivariable logistic regression.\n\n Secondary outcomes included mortality in the ICU, in-hospital mortality and 1-year mortality.\n\n An a priori subgroup analysis of patients with versus without sepsis was performed to assess any differences in the relationship

We analyzed data on the first 425 confirmed cases in Wuhan to determine the epidemiologic characteristics of NCIP.\n\n\nMethods\nWe collected information on demographic characteristics, exposure history, and illness timelines of laboratory-confirmed cases of NCIP that had been reported by January 22, 2020. We described characteristics of the cases and estimated the key epidemiologic time-delay distributions.\n\n In the early period of exponential growth, we estimated the epidemic doubling time and the basic reproductive number.\n\n\nResults\nAmong the first 425 patients with confirmed NCIP, the median age was 59 years and 56% were male.\n\n The majority of cases (55%) with onset before January 1, 2020, were linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, as compared with 8.6% of the subsequent cases.\n\n The mean incubation period was 5.2 days (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.1 to 7.0), with the 95th percentile of the distribution at 12.5 days.\n\n In its early stages, the epidemic doubled in size every 7.4 days.\n\n With a mean serial interval of 7.5 days (95% CI, 5.3 to 19), the basic reproductive number was estimated to be 2.2 (95% CI, 1.4 to 3.9).\n\n\nConclusions\nOn the basis of this information, there is evidence that human-to-human transmission has occurred among close contacts since the middle of December 2019. Considerable efforts to reduce transmission will be required to control outbreaks if similar dynamics apply elsewhere.\n\n Measures to prevent or reduce transmission should be implemented in populations at risk.\n\n (Funded by the Ministry of Science and Technology of China and others.\n\n)\n","id":"PMC7121484","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Massachusetts Medical Society","authors":[{"firstname":"Qun","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xuhua","surname":"Guan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Peng","surname":"Wu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xiaoye","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lei","surname":"Zhou","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yeqing","surname":"Tong","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ruiqi","surname":"Ren","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Kathy S.M.","surname":"Leung","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Eric H.Y.","surname":"Lau","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jessica Y.","surname":"Wong","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xuesen","surname":"Xing","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Nijuan","surname":"Xiang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yang","surname":"Wu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Chao","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Qi","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Dan","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Tian","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jing","surname":"Zhao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Man","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Wenxiao","surname":"Tu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Chuding","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lianmei","surname":"Jin","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Rui","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Qi","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Suhua","surname":"Zhou","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Rui","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Hui","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yinbo","surname":"Luo","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yuan","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ge","surname":"Shao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Huan","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhongfa","surname":"Tao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yang","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhiqiang","surname":"Deng","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Boxi","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhitao","surname":"Ma","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yanping","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Guoqing","surname":"Shi","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Tommy T.Y.","surname":"Lam","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Joseph T.","surname":"Wu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"George F.","surname":"Gao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Benjamin J.","surname":"Cowling","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Bo","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Bo","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Gabriel M.","surname":"Leung","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zijian","surname":"Feng","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}],"References depth 2":[{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"The 2019-nCoV Outbreak Joint Field Epidemiology Investigation Team, Li Q.

January 2020. We analyzed data on the first 425 confirmed cases in Wuhan to determine the epidemiologic characteristics of NCIP.\n\n\nMethods\nWe collected information on demographic characteristics, exposure history, and illness timelines of laboratory-confirmed cases of NCIP that had been reported by January 22, 2020. We described characteristics of the cases and estimated the key epidemiologic time-delay distributions.\n\n In the early period of exponential growth, we estimated the epidemic doubling time and the basic reproductive number.\n\n\nResults\nAmong the first 425 patients with confirmed NCIP, the median age was 59 years and 56% were male.\n\n The majority of cases (55%) with onset before January 1, 2020, were linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, as compared with 8.6% of the subsequent cases.\n\n The mean incubation period was 5.2 days (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.1 to 7.0), with the 95th percentile of the distribution at 12.5 days.\n\n In its early stages, the epidemic doubled in size every 7.4 days.\n\n With a mean serial interval of 7.5 days (95% CI, 5.3 to 19), the basic reproductive number was estimated to be 2.2 (95% CI, 1.4 to 3.9).\n\n\nConclusions\nOn the basis of this information, there is evidence that human-to-human transmission has occurred among close contacts since the middle of December 2019.

Therapeutic Options","abstract":"Strokes within pediatric populations are considered to be the 10th leading cause of death in the United States of America, with over half of such events occurring in children younger than one year of life.\n The multifactorial etiopathology that has an influence on stroke development and occurrence signify the importance of the timely recognition of both modifiable and non-modifiable factors for adequate diagnostic and treatment approaches.\n The early recognition of a stroke and stroke risk in children has the potential to advance the application of neuroprotective, thrombolytic, and antithrombotic interventions and rehabilitation strategies to the earliest possible timepoints after the onset of a stroke, improving the outcomes and quality of life for affected children and their families.\n The recent development of molecular genetic methods has greatly facilitated the analysis and diagnosis of single-gene disorders.\n In this review, the most significant single gene disorders associated with pediatric stroke are presented, along with specific therapeutic options whenever they exist.\n Besides monogenic disorders that may present with stroke as a first symptom, genetic polymorphisms may contribute to the risk of pediatric and perinatal stroke.\n The most frequently studied genetic risk factors are several common polymorphisms in genes associated with thrombophilia; these genes code for proteins that are part of the coagulation cascade, fibrolysis, homocystein metabolism, lipid metabolism, or platelets.\n Single polymorphism frequencies may not be sufficient to completely explain the stroke causality and an analysis of several genotype combinations is a more promising approach.\n The recent steps forward in our understanding of the disorders underlying strokes has given us a next generation of therapeutics and therapeutic targets by which to improve stroke survival, protect or rebuild neuronal connections in the brain, and enhance neural function.\n Advances in DNA sequencing and the development of new tools to correct human gene mutations have brought genetic analysis and gene therapy into the focus of investigations for new therapeutic options for stroke patients.\n","id":"PMC8835808","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"MDPI","authors":[{"firstname":"Milena","surname":"Jankovic","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Bojana","surname":"Petrovic","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Bojana","surname":"Petrovic","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ivana","surname":"Novakovic","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Slavko","surname":"Brankovic","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Natasa","surname":"Radosavljevic","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Natasa","surname":"Radosavljevic","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Dejan","surname":"Nikolic","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Cesar","surname":"Borlongan","email":"NULL","contributions":"3"},{"firstname":"Cesar","surname":"Borlongan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Cesar","surname":"Borlongan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1016/j.pediatrneurol.2012.09.016","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Genetic

coronaviruses: A narrative review for clinicians","abstract":"Introduction\nThe past two decades have been marked by three epidemics linked to emerging coronaviruses.\n\n The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the existence of neurological manifestations associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection and raised the question of the neuropathogenicity of coronaviruses.\n\n The aim of this review was to summarize the current data about neurological manifestations and diseases linked to human coronaviruses.\n\n\nMaterial and methods\nArticles have been identified by searches of PubMed and Google scholar up to September 25, 2020, using a combination of coronavirus and neurology search terms and adding relevant references in the articles.\n\n\nResults\nWe found five cohorts providing prevalence data of neurological symptoms among a total of 2533 hospitalized COVID-19 patients, and articles focusing on COVID-19 patients with neurological manifestations including a total of 580 patients.\n\n Neurological symptoms involved up to 73% of COVID-19 hospitalized patients, and were mostly headache, myalgias and impaired consciousness.\n\n Central nervous system (CNS) manifestations reported in COVID-19 were mostly non-specific encephalopathies that represented between 13% and 40% of all neurological manifestations; post-infectious syndromes including acute demyelinating encephalomyelitis (ADEM, n = 13), acute necrotizing encephalopathy (ANE, n = 4), Bickerstaff's encephalitis (n = 5), generalized myoclonus (n = 3) and acute transverse myelitis (n = 7); other encephalitis including limbic encephalitis (n = 9) and miscellaneous encephalitis with variable radiologic findings (n = 26); acute cerebrovascular diseases including ischemic strokes (between 1.3% and 4.7% of COVID-19 patients), hemorrhagic strokes (n = 17), cerebral venous thrombosis (n = 8) and posterior reversible encephalopathy (n = 5).\n\n Peripheral nervous system (PNS) manifestations reported in COVID-19 were the following: Guillain–Barré syndrome (n = 31) and variants including Miller Fisher syndrome (n = 3), polyneuritis cranialis (n = 2) and facial diplegia (n = 2); isolated oculomotor neuropathy (n = 6); critical illness myopathy (n = 6).\n\n Neuropathological studies in COVID-19 patients demonstrated different patterns of CNS damage, mostly ischemic and hemorrhagic changes with few cases of inflammatory injuries.\n\n Only one case suggested SARS-CoV-2 infiltration in endothelial and neural cells.\n\n We found 10 case reports or case series describing 22 patients with neurological manifestations associated with other human coronaviruses.\n\n Among them we found four MERS patients with ADEM or Bickerstaff's encephalitis, two SARS patients with encephalitis who had a positive SARS-CoV PCR in cerebrospinal fluid, five patients with ischemic strokes associated with SARS, eight MERS patients with critical illness neuromyopathy and one MERS patient with Guillain–Barré Syndrome.\n\n An autopsy study on SARS-CoV patients demonstrated the presence of the virus in the brain of eight patients.\n\n\nConclusion\nThe wide range of neurological manifestations and diseases associated with SARS-CoV-2 is consistent with multiple pathogenic pathways including post-infectious mechanisms, septic-associated encephalopathies, coagulopathy or endothelitis.\n\n There was no definite evidence to support direct neuropathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2.\n","id":"PMC7832485","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Elsevier Masson

the demands on sensory processing (visual vs.\n auditory), sublexical phonological input (words and pseudowords vs.\n nonverbal stimuli), and semantic content (words and objects vs.\n pseudowords and

the integration of sublexical and lexical cues.\n In anterior dorsal SMG, activation was higher for both pseudoword reading and object naming compared with word reading, which is more consistent with executive demands than phonological processing.\n The dissociation of these four “functionally-distinct” regions, all within left SMG, has implications for differentiating between different types of

emerging virus involved in cases and case clusters of severe acute respiratory infection in the Arabian Peninsula, Tunisia, Morocco, France, Italy, Germany, and the UK.\n\n We provide a full description of a fatal case of MERS-CoV infection and associated phylogenetic analyses.\n\n\nMethods\nWe report data for a patient who was admitted to the Klinikum Schwabing (Munich, Germany) for severe acute respiratory infection.\n\n We did diagnostic RT-PCR and indirect immunofluorescence.\n\n From time of diagnosis, respiratory, faecal, and urine samples were obtained for virus quantification.\n\n We constructed a maximum likelihood tree of the five available complete MERS-CoV genomes.\n\n\nFindings\nA 73-year-old man from Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates, was transferred to Klinikum Schwabing on March 19, 2013, on day 11 of illness.\n\n He had been diagnosed with multiple myeloma in 2008, and had received several lines of treatment.\n\n The patient died on day 18, due to septic shock.\n\n MERS-CoV was detected in two samples of bronchoalveolar fluid.\n\n Viral loads were highest in samples from the lower respiratory tract (up to 1·2?×?106 copies per mL).\n\n Maximum virus concentration in urine samples was 2691 RNA copies per mL on day 13; the virus was not present in the urine after renal failure on day 14. Stool samples obtained on days 12 and 16 contained the virus, with up to 1031 RNA copies per g (close to the lowest detection limit of the assay).\n\n One of two oronasal swabs obtained on day 16 were positive, but yielded little viral RNA (5370 copies per mL).\n\n No virus was detected in blood.\n\n The full virus genome was combined with four other available full genome sequences in a maximum likelihood phylogeny, correlating branch lengths with dates of isolation.\n\n The time of the common ancestor was halfway through 2011. Addition of novel genome data from an unlinked case treated 6 months previously in Essen, Germany, showed a clustering of viruses derived from Qatar and the United Arab Emirates.\n\n\nInterpretation\nWe have provided the first complete viral load profile in a case of MERS-CoV infection.\n\n MERS-CoV might have shedding patterns that are different from those of severe acute respiratory syndrome and so might need alternative diagnostic approaches.\n\n\nFunding\nEuropean Union; German Centre for Infection Research; German Research Council; and German Ministry for Education and Research.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7164791","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Elsevier Ltd.","authors":[{"firstname":"Christian","surname":"Drosten","email":"drosten@virology-bonn.de","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Michael","surname":"Seilmaier","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Victor M","surname":"Corman","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Wulf","surname":"Hartmann","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Gregor","surname":"Scheible","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Stefan","surname":"Sack","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Wolfgang","surname":"Guggemos","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Rene","surname":"Kallies","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Doreen","surname":"Muth","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Sandra","surname":"Junglen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Marcel A","surname":"Müller","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Walter","surname":"Haas","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Hana","surname":"Guberina","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Tim","surname":"Röhnisch","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Monika","surname":"Schmid-Wendtner","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Souhaib","surname":"Aldabbagh","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ulf","surname":"Dittmer","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Hermann","surname":"Gold","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Petra","surname":"Graf","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Frank","surname":"Bonin","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Andrew","surname":"Rambaut","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Clemens-Martin","surname":"Wendtner","email":"clemens.wendtner@klinikum-muenchen.de","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1056/NEJMoa1211721","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Isolation of a novel coronavirus from a man with pneumonia in Saudi Arabia.","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1016/S1473-3099(13)70164-6","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus neutralising serum antibodies in dromedary camels: a comparative serological study","abstract":"Background\nA new betacoronavirus—Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV)—has been identified in patients with severe acute respiratory infection.\n\n Although related viruses infect bats, molecular clock analyses have been unable to identify direct ancestors of MERS-CoV.\n\n Anecdotal exposure histories suggest that patients had been in contact with dromedary camels or goats.\n\n We investigated possible animal reservoirs of MERS-CoV by assessing specific serum antibodies in livestock.\n\n\nMethods\nWe took sera from animals in the Middle East (Oman) and from elsewhere (Spain, Netherlands, Chile).\n\n Cattle (n=80), sheep (n=40), goats (n=40), dromedary camels (n=155), and various other camelid species (n=34) were tested for specific serum IgG by protein microarray using the receptor-binding S1 subunits of spike proteins of MERS-CoV, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, and human coronavirus OC43.

In their study, all nine women had a caesarean section in the third trimester. The neonatal outcomes were favourable and all neonatal throat swabs performed, tested negative for the virus.\nAnother clinical series of 11 women with COVID 19 infection who had successful deliveries (10 caesarean and 1 vaginal) has been reported: in all the newborns, the 2019-nCoV nucleic acid test was negative. \nChen et al. concluded their paper by underlining that 'there is currently no evidence for intrauterine infection caused by vertical transmission in women who develop COVID-19 pneumonia in late pregnancy'. This finding is, however, based on very few reported cases, particularly for vaginally delivered newborns. Accordingly, a recent consensus stated that there is no clear evidence regarding optimal delivery timing, the safety of vaginal delivery or whether caesarean delivery prevents vertical transmission at the time of delivery. The route of delivery and delivery timing should therefore be individualised, based on obstetrical indications and maternal-fetal status. \nDue to the recent outbreak of the infection in Italy, particularly in Lombardy, a number of infected women have already delivered. Regione Lombardia, Northern Italy, has established a network of six designated COVID-19 maternity hospitals to offer adequate assistance and epidemiological surveillance to symptomatic, infected pregnant women.\nThe goal of this study was to report the mode of delivery and immediate neonatal outcome in SARS-CoV-2-infected women observed in the early phase of the epidemic in Lombardy.\nMethods\nWe performed a retrospective multicentre study of COVID-19-infected women who were admitted and delivered during 1-20 March 2020. Most deliveries of infected women occurred in the designated COVID-19 hubs, but some were delivered in special hospitals because they were in an advanced active phase of labour. The designated Hub-Maternity Hospitals were: Milan-Mangiagalli and Sacco, Bergamo-Pope Giovanni XXIII; Brescia-Civil Hospital; Monza-S. Gerardo Hospital/MBBM Foundation; Pavia-San Matteo. Spokes Maternity Hospitals were: Milan-Melloni and S. Giuseppe; Seriate-Bolognini; Treviglio-Civil Hospital. The Maternity Hospital of Padua and the Maternity Hospital of Modena were not hub hospitals of the Lombardy Region but their cases were also reported for this study.\nPregnant women who delivered during the study period with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 infection prior to or within 36 hours after delivery.\nCriteria for entry to the study were:  \nThe investigators reported all women consecutively observed who met the inclusion criteria.\nAll centres carefully revised all delivery charts of the study period and all cases who had a confirmed nasopharyngeal swab with an RT-PCR positive test for SARS-CoV-2 infection were included. The clinical triage was performed according to WHO guidelines. Diagnosis of COVID 19 infection was based on the results of maternal and child nasopharyngeal swab samples according to Italian national procedures. All women were treated according to the national guidelines for COVID-19 in pregnancy and treatment was then tailored to the individual based on evolution of signs, symptoms, laboratory data and radiological findings. There were no additional obstetric diagnostic procedures or monitoring besides normal clinical practice, apart from a confirmative chest X-ray and 48-hour monitoring of white blood cell count and CRP.\nFetal growth and well-being were assessed at admission and the fetal heart rate was monitored continuously during labour and delivery.\nDuring labour, surgical masks for the labouring woman, her accompanying person and the midwife and/or doctor were worn. More strict personal protective equipment (PPE) was worn during delivery, as the expulsive efforts of bearing down may cause the woman to emit infected droplets.\nWhen the positive infected status of the mother was known at delivery, breast feeding was allowed according to international guidelines if the mother was asymptomatic or had only minor symptoms. Women were instructed how to wear and dispose of surgical masks, in combination with frequent hand-cleaning with alcohol-based hand rub or soap and water.\nData were collected from the clinical records using a standardised questionnaire on maternal general characteristics, any medical or obstetric co-morbidity, course of pregnancy, clinical signs and symptoms, treatment of COVID 19 infection, mode of delivery, neonatal data and breastfeeding. In relation to the neonatal outcome, we recorded only whether there was a positive or negative test for COVID-19. Women and newborns were followed up until discharge from hospital or until 25 March, whichever came first.\nFor the recorded variables, averages, range or proportion and corresponding 95% CI were computed, as appropriate. Statistically significant differences among groups were tested using the common Chi-square test for heterogeneity.\nNo core outcome set was used in the research. This research was done without patient involvement. Patients were not invited to comment on the study design and were not consulted to develop patient-relevant outcomes or interpret the results. Patients were not invited to contribute to the writing or editing of this document for readability or accuracy.\nThe study protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Boards.\nThis study received no funding.\nResults\nA total of 42 women eligible for the study delivered in the participating centres; 32 women delivered at hub hospitals and 10 in the specialised ones.\nDiagnosis of COVID-19 infection was known before admission to hospital in 10 cases, in the delivery room in 27 cases and in 5 cases within 36 hours following delivery, while the women were still in hospital.\nIn all, 24/42 (57.1%, 95% CI 41.0-72.3) women delivered vaginally, with three cases undergoing induction of labour for obstetric reasons.\nAn elective caesarean section was performed in 18/42 (42.9%, 95% CI 27.7-59.0) cases: in 8 cases the indication was unrelated to COVID-19 infection but in 10 cases the indications were worsening dyspnoea or other COVID-19-related symptoms. In women who attempted vaginal delivery, no emergency caesarean section occurred.\nThe characteristics, signs, symptoms and treatment of COVID-19 infection of this cohort are presented in Table 1 according to mode of delivery. Mean maternal age was 32.9 (range 21-44). Fever was the most common symptom. Pneumonia was diagnosed in 19/42 (45.2%, 95% CI 29.8-61.3) cases. Seven of these 19 (36.8%, 95% CI 16.3-61.6) required oxygen support and four of the 19 (21.1%, 95% CI 6.1-45.6) were admitted to a critical care unit.

Two women had a new diagnosis of COVID-19 infection in the postpartum period and breastfed without a surgical mask; both newborns had a positive test for COVID-19 infection at day 1 and 3, respectively.\nIn another case after vaginal delivery, the newborn of an infected woman had a positive test. Additional details about this case deserve mention. One newborn from a COVID-19 mother delivered vaginally at term in good condition, was immediately separated from the mother because of a severe maternal postpartum haemorrhage. Within a few hours, the child developed gastrointestinal symptoms. After 3 days, he developed respiratory symptoms and was transferred to the neonatal intensive care unit, where he recovered after 1 day of mechanical ventilation. The first test for SARS-CoV-2 was equivocal a few hours after delivery, but positive 3 days later. The mother did not breastfeed. No associated healthcare providers had a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 infection. No other newborn tested positive.\nDiscussion\nMain findings\nThis paper reports the obstetric outcome of a cohort of COVID-19-affected pregnant women and the rate of SARS-CoV-2 positivity in newborns according to mode of delivery and breastfeeding status.\nThe general results show that vaginal delivery occurred in about the 60% of women. A low risk of intrapartum SARS-Cov-2 transmission to the newborn cannot be excluded.\nThe majority of pregnant women affected by the COVID-19 respiratory syndromes suffered mild or moderate symptoms. Fever, cough and mild dyspnoea were the most common symptoms (80%), but pneumonia was diagnosed in about the 40% of women.\nStrengths and limitations\nAmong the strengths of this analysis, we included in our study all consecutive positive women delivered in or admitted to the postpartum COVID-19 ward, in all maternity units of the COVID-network in Lombardy and Units of Padua and Modena, so as to be sure to include all symptomatic cases who tested positive on the nasopharyngeal sampling. The reported cases represent approximately 0.6% of the total deliveries occurring in the same area during the 20 days of the study.\nAmong the limitations we should underline that due to the limited follow up, the non-immediate maternal and newborn outcome was not considered.\nInterpretation\nIn our study, the maternal conditions were generally mild to moderate. Radiologically confirmed pneumonia was diagnosed in 42% of cases and four of these 19 cases required admission to a critical care unit. As suggested by others, the findings of our cohort support the hypothesis that COVID-19 respiratory syndrome may be less severe for maternal prognosis than were SARS and MERS.\nLymphopaenia and high CRP values were part of the clinical scenario that induced clinicians to deliver patients by caesarean section.\nOf note, two cases were delivered &lt;34 weeks of gestation because of worsening respiratory function. Five women delivered spontaneously before term (one before 34 weeks of gestation). These observations are compatible with no increase in the risk of preterm birth, consistent with the findings of a previously published series reporting no cases of preterm birth before 33 weeks of gestation. \nVertical and intrapartum transmission are among the most serious complications of viral diseases during pregnancy. In the previously quoted published series of a total of 30 women, delivery in all but one case was by caesarean section. No newborn infection was reported. Vertical transmission does not seem to occur after infection with other pathogenic coronaviruses such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV- infection, although it has been suggested that coronaviruses may cause early pregnancy loss. \nPrevious data on virus transmission are based substantially on women delivered by caesarean section. Vertical transmission of viral infection generally occurs during intrauterine life by transfer across the placenta, or during delivery by ingestion or aspiration of cervicovaginal secretions, and in the postpartum period via breastfeeding . The risk of ingestion or aspiration of cervical secretion or with contact with perineal-infected tissue is of course higher in the case of vaginal delivery. Among the 24 women who delivered vaginally, one newborn was infected, probably due to postpartum contamination (see below). In a second case after vaginal delivery, a potential intrapartum infection might have occurred but it was not possible to exclude infection immediately postpartum.\nIt should be emphasised that we can only consider the risk of transmission among women who were infected during the third trimester or at term and the risk of intrapartum transmission, because all infections in Northern Italy are recent and the women infected in early pregnancy are still pregnant.\nWe report five women who were diagnosed to be COVID-19-positive because of fever in the postpartum period. In two cases in which skin-to-skin contact after birth and breastfeeding was allowed without a mask because infection was not known, the COVID-19 test of the newborn was positive at day 1 and 3 after birth. Although no viral load has been detected in breast milk by Chan et al., close maternal contact may represent a potential route of transmission. In these two cases, because viral testing was not carried out immediately after birth, vertical transmission cannot be excluded.\nTo our knowledge, two other cases of SARS-CoV-2-infected newborns have been reported in which the diagnosis was made respectively 36 hours following delivery and at 17 days of life. In both cases, a postpartum neonatal infection acquired through an infected contact was suggested. In both these cases, because viral testing was not performed immediately after birth, the route of transmission cannot be definitely established.\nElevated IGM antibodies against coronavirus have been also reported by Dong et al.in a case after caesarean section. Three additional newborns with elevated IGM antibodies to SARS-COv-2 virus, but with a a negative RT-PCR throat swab test, have been also reported. Caution in interpreting these findings has been suggested, including the possibility that IGM positivity could represent a laboratory artefact. \nConclusion\nThe frequency of COVID-19 symptoms and positive laboratory and radiological findings observed in this cohort are in line with this syndrome generally being mild or moderate in pregnancy and many infected pregnant women very likely being totally asymptomatic or developing symptoms only after delivery. Vaginal delivery is appropriate in mild cases and caesarean section should be reserved for women with severe respiratory problems, where delivering the baby will allow improved ventilation. Although postpartum infection cannot be excluded, our study also suggests that vaginal delivery may be associated with a low risk of intrapartum SARS-Cov-2 transmission to the newborn. Further data on this finding is needed.\nThe observed occurrence of COVID-19 symptoms only after delivery suggests that, in areas characterised by a high prevalence of infection, safe procedures for midwives and doctors are to be recommended in any labour as well as adopting mask and safe procedures in all breastfeeding women.\nDisclosure of interests\nNone declared.

outbreak caused by the 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) were based on information from the general population.\n\n Limited data are available for pregnant women with COVID-19 pneumonia.\n\n This study aimed to evaluate the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 in pregnancy and the intrauterine vertical transmission potential of COVID-19 infection.\n\n\nMethods\nClinical records, laboratory results, and chest CT scans were retrospectively reviewed for nine pregnant women with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia (ie, with maternal throat swab samples that were positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 [SARS-CoV-2]) who were admitted to Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, China, from Jan 20 to Jan 31, 2020. Evidence of intrauterine vertical transmission was assessed by testing for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in amniotic fluid, cord blood, and neonatal throat swab samples.\n\n Breastmilk samples were also collected and tested from patients after the first lactation.\n\n\nFindings\nAll nine patients had a caesarean section in their third trimester.\n\n Seven patients presented with a fever.\n\n Other symptoms, including cough (in four of nine patients), myalgia (in three), sore throat (in two), and malaise (in two), were also observed.\n\n Fetal distress was monitored in two cases.\n\n Five of nine patients had lymphopenia (&lt;1·0?×?10? cells per L).\n\n Three patients had increased aminotransferase concentrations.\n\n None of the patients developed severe COVID-19 pneumonia or died, as of Feb 4, 2020. Nine livebirths were recorded.\n\n No neonatal asphyxia was observed in newborn babies.\n\n All nine livebirths had a 1-min Apgar score of 8–9 and a 5-min Apgar score of 9–10. Amniotic fluid, cord blood, neonatal throat swab, and breastmilk samples from six patients were tested for SARS-CoV-2, and all samples tested negative for the virus.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe clinical characteristics of COVID-19 pneumonia in pregnant women were similar to those reported for non-pregnant adult patients who developed COVID-19 pneumonia.\n\n Findings from this small group of cases suggest that there is currently no evidence for intrauterine infection caused by vertical transmission in women who develop COVID-19 pneumonia in late pregnancy.\n\n\nFunding\nHubei Science and Technology Plan, Wuhan University Medical Development Plan.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7159281","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Elsevier Ltd.","authors":[{"firstname":"Huijun","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Juanjuan","surname":"Guo","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Chen","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Fan","surname":"Luo","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xuechen","surname":"Yu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Wei","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jiafu","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Dongchi","surname":"Zhao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Dan","surname":"Xu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Qing","surname":"Gong","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jing","surname":"Liao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Huixia","surname":"Yang","email":"yanghuixia@bjmu.edu.cn","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Wei","surname":"Hou","email":"houwei@whu.edu.cn","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yuanzhen","surname":"Zhang","email":"zhangyuanzhen@whu.edu.cn","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1128/JCM.00941-20","date":"2020-05-06","title":"Performance Characteristics of the Abbott Architect SARS-CoV-2 IgG Assay and Seroprevalence in Boise, Idaho","abstract":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the novel respiratory illness caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is associated with severe morbidity and mortality.\n The rollout of diagnostic testing in the United States was slow, leading to numerous cases that were not tested for SARS-CoV-2 in February and March 2020 and necessitating the use of serological testing to determine past infections.\n Here, we evaluated the Abbott SARS-CoV-2 IgG test for detection of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies by testing 3 distinct patient populations.\n","id":"PMC7383515","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"American Society for Microbiology","authors":[{"firstname":"Andrew","surname":"Bryan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Gregory","surname":"Pepper","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Mark H.","surname":"Wener","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Susan L.","surname":"Fink","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Chihiro","surname":"Morishima","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Anu","surname":"Chaudhary","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Keith R.","surname":"Jerome","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Patrick C.","surname":"Mathias","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Alexander L.","surname":"Greninger","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Alexander J.","surname":"McAdam","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Alexander J.","surname":"McAdam","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1038/2101070a0","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Elevation of Cord over Maternal IgG Immunoglobulin: Evidence for an Active Placental IgG Transport","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1136/adc.47.253.382","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Serum IgM in Diagnosis of Infection in the Newborn","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1001/jama.2020.4861","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Antibodies in Infants Born to Mothers With COVID-19 Pneumonia","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]}]},{"doi":"10.1001/jama.2020.4868","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Can SARS-CoV-2 infection be acquired in utero?
