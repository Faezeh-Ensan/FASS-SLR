By Jan 7, 2020, Chinese scientists had isolated a novel coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2; previously known as 2019-nCoV), from these patients with virus-infected pneumonia, which was later designated coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in February, 2020, by WHO. \nAlthough the outbreak is likely to have started from a zoonotic transmission event associated with a large seafood market that also traded in live wild animals, it soon became clear that efficient person-to-person transmission was also occurring. The clinical spectrum of SARS-CoV-2 infection appears to be wide, encompassing asymptomatic infection, mild upper respiratory tract illness, and severe viral pneumonia with respiratory failure and even death, with many patients being hospitalised with pneumonia in Wuhan. Although some case series have been published, many patients in these series remained hospitalised at time of publication. To our knowledge, no previous studies have been done among patients with definite outcomes. The estimation of risk factors for severe disease and death in these earlier case series are therefore not very robust. Additionally, details of the clinical and virological course of illness have not yet been well described.\nHere, we present details of all patients admitted to the two designated hospitals in Wuhan:Jinyintan Hospital and Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital:with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 and a definite clinical outcome (death or discharge) as of Jan 31, 2020. We aim to explore risk factors of in-hospital death for patients and describe the clinical course of symptoms, viral shedding, and temporal changes of laboratory findings during hospitalisation.\nResearch in context\n Evidence before this study \nWe searched PubMed on Feb 23, 2020, for articles that documented the risk factors of mortality and viral shedding in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), resulting from infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), using the search terms (&quot;novel coronavirus&quot; OR &quot;SARS-CoV-2&quot; OR &quot;COVID-19&quot;) AND (&quot;death&quot; OR &quot;mortality&quot; OR &quot;viral shedding&quot;) with no language or time restrictions. Age, comorbidities, lymphocytopenia and elevated alanine aminotransferase, d-dimer, creatine kinase, high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I, prothrombin time, and disease severity were reported to be associated with intensive care unit admission. However, no published works were found about the risk factors of mortality for adult patients with COVID-19. One study compared the sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection in throat and nasopharyngeal swab in 17 patients with COVID-19.\n Added value of this study \nIn this retrospective cohort study of adult inpatients in two hospitals in Wuhan, China, we found increasing odds of in-hospital death associated with older age (odds ratio 1 10, 95% CI 1 03-1 17; p=0 0043), higher Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score (5 65, 2 61-12 23; p&lt;0 0001), and d-dimer levels greater than 1 0 mug/mL (18 42, 2 64-128 55; p=0 0033) on admission. Duration of viral shedding ranged between 8 and 37 days. The median duration of viral shedding was 20 0 days (IQR 17 0-24 0) in survivors, but continued until death in fatal cases.\n Implications of all the available evidence \nOlder age, elevated d-dimer levels, and high SOFA score could help clinicians to identify at an early stage those patients with COVID-19 who have poor prognosis. Prolonged viral shedding provides the rationale for a strategy of isolation of infected patients and optimal antiviral interventions in the future.\nMethods\nStudy design and participants\nThis retrospective cohort study included two cohorts of adult inpatients (&gt;=18 years old) from Jinyintan Hospital and Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital (Wuhan, China). All adult patients who were diagnosed with COVID-19 according to WHO interim guidance were screened, and those who died or were discharged between Dec 29, 2019 (ie, when the first patients were admitted), and Jan 31, 2020, were included in our study. Since these two hospitals were the only designated hospitals for transfer of patients with COVID-19 from other hospitals in Wuhan until Feb 1, 2020, our study enrolled all adult inpatients who were hospitalised for COVID-19 and had a definite outcome (dead or discharged) at the early stage of the outbreak.\nBefore Jan 11, 2020, SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection results were not available in the electronic medical records, from which data for this study were obtained retrospectively; therefore, this study includes 29 of the 41 patients originally reported on. \nThe study was approved by the Research Ethics Commission of Jinyintan Hospital (KY-2020-01.01) and the requirement for informed consent was waived by the Ethics Commission as described previously. \nData collection\nEpidemiological, demographic, clinical, laboratory, treatment, and outcome data were extracted from electronic medical records using a standardised data collection form, which was a modified version of the WHO/International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium case record form for severe acute respiratory infections. All data were checked by two physicians (FZ and ZL) and a third researcher (GF) adjudicated any difference in interpretation between the two primary reviewers.\nLaboratory procedures\nMethods for laboratory confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 infection have been described elsewhere. Briefly, four institutions:the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, the Chinese Academy of Medical Science, the Academy of Military Medical Sciences, and the Wuhan Institute of Virology, Chinese Academy of Sciences:were responsible for SARS-CoV-2 detection in respiratory specimens by next-generation sequencing or real-time RT-PCR methods. From Jan 11, 2020, SARS-CoV-2 RNA were detected by local Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, local health institutions, and Jingyintan Hospital and Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital. Throat-swab specimens were obtained for SARS-CoV-2 PCR re-examination every other day after clinical remission of symptoms, including fever, cough, and dyspnoea, but only qualitative data were available. The criteria for discharge were absence of fever for at least 3 days, substantial improvement in both lungs in chest CT, clinical remission of respiratory symptoms, and two throat-swab samples negative for SARS-CoV-2 RNA obtained at least 24 h apart.\nRoutine blood examinations were complete blood count, coagulation profile, serum biochemical tests (including renal and liver function, creatine kinase, lactate dehydrogenase, and electrolytes), myocardial enzymes, interleukin-6 (IL-6), serum ferritin, and procalcitonin. Chest radiographs or CT scan were also done for all inpatients. Frequency of examinations was determined by the treating physician.\nDefinitions\nFever was defined as axillary temperature of at least 37 3 C. Sepsis and septic shock were defined according to the 2016 Third International Consensus Definition for Sepsis and Septic Shock. Secondary infection was diagnosed when patients showed clinical symptoms or signs of pneumonia or bacteraemia and a positive culture of a new pathogen was obtained from lower respiratory tract specimens (qualified sputum, endotracheal aspirate, or bronchoalveolar lavage fluid) or blood samples after admission. Ventilator-associated pneumonia was diagnosed according to the guidelines for treatment of hospital-acquired and ventilator-associated pneumonia. Acute kidney injury was diagnosed according to the KDIGO clinical practice guidelines and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) was diagnosed according to the Berlin Definition. Acute cardiac injury was diagnosed if serum levels of cardiac biomarkers (eg, high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I) were above the 99th percentile upper reference limit, or if new abnormalities were shown in electrocardiography and echocardiography. The illness severity of COVID-19 was defined according to the Chinese management guideline for COVID-19 (version 6.0). Coagulopathy was defined as a 3-second extension of prothrombin time or a 5-second extension of activated partial thromboplastin time. Hypoproteinaemia was defined as blood albumin of less than 25 g/L. Exposure history was defined as exposure to people with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection or to the Wuhan seafood market.\nStatistical analysis\nContinuous and categorical variables were presented as median (IQR) and n (%), respectively. We used the Mann-Whitney U test, chi2 test, or Fisher's exact test to compare differences between survivors and non-survivors where appropriate. To explore the risk factors associated with in-hospital death, univariable and multivariable logistic regression models were used. Considering the total number of deaths (n=54) in our study and to avoid overfitting in the model, five variables were chosen for multivariable analysis on the basis of previous findings and clinical constraints. Previous studies have shown blood levels of d-dimer and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) scores to be higher in critically ill or fatal cases, whereas lymphopenia and cardiovascular disease have been less commonly observed in non-critical or surviving patients with SARS-COV-2 infection. Similar risk factors, including older age, have been reported associated with adverse clinical outcomes in adults with SARS and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS). Some laboratory findings, including alanine aminotransferase (ALT), lactate dehydrogenase, high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I, creatine kinase, d-dimer, serum ferritin, and IL-6, might be unavailable in emergency circumstances. Therefore, we chose lymphocyte count, d-dimer, SOFA score, coronary heart disease, and age as the five variables for our multivariable logistic regression model.\nWe excluded variables from the univariable analysis if their between-group differences were not significant, if their accuracy was unconfirmed (eg, exposure, which was self-reported), if the number of events was too small to calculate odds ratios, and if they had colinearity with the SOFA score.\nWe compared patient characteristics between the two hospitals and used a generalised linear model to adjust for possible differences in patients' characteristics and treatment between the two study centres.\nA two-sided alpha of less than 0 05 was considered statistically significant. Statistical analyses were done using the SAS software (version 9.4), unless otherwise indicated.\nRole of the funding source\nThe funder of the study had no role in study design, data collection, data analysis, data interpretation, or writing of the report. The corresponding authors (BC and HC) had full access to all the data in the study and had final responsibility for the decision to submit for publication.\nResults\nDemographic, clinical, laboratory, and radiographic findings of patients on admission\n		Total (n=191)	Non-survivor (n=54)	Survivor (n=137)	p value	 	Demographics and clinical characteristics	 	Age, years	56 0 (46 0-67 0)	69 0 (63 0-76 0)	52 0 (45 0-58 0)	&lt;0 0001	 	Sex	..	..	..	0 15	 		Female	72 (38%)	16 (30%)	56 (41%)	..

After excluding 613 patients that were still hospitalised or not confirmed by SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection as of Jan 31, 2020, and nine inpatients without available key information in their medical records, we included 191 inpatients (135 from Jinyintan Hospital and 56 from Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital) in the final analysis. 54 patients died during hospitalisation and 137 were discharged. The median age of the 191 patients was 56 0 years (IQR 46 0-67 0), ranging from 18 years to 87 years, and most patients were male (table 1 ). Comorbidities were present in nearly half of patients, with hypertension being the most common comorbidity, followed by diabetes and coronary heart disease (table 1). The most common symptoms on admission were fever and cough, followed by sputum production and fatigue (table 1). Lymphocytopenia occurred in 77 (40%) patients. 181 (95%) patients received antibiotics and 41 (21%) received antivirals (lopinavir/ritonavir; table 2 ). Systematic corticosteroid and intravenous immunoglobulin use differed significantly between non-survivors and survivors (table 2). The comparison of characteristics, treatment, and outcomes of patients from the two hospitals are shown in the appendix (pp 2-4).\nThe median time from illness onset (ie, before admission) to discharge was 22 0 days (IQR 18 0-25 0), whereas the median time to death was 18 5 days (15 0-22 0; table 2). 32 patients required invasive mechanical ventilation, of whom 31 (97%) died. The median time from illness onset to invasive mechanical ventilation was 14 5 days (12 0-19 0). Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation was used in three patients, none of whom survived. Sepsis was the most frequently observed complication, followed by respiratory failure, ARDS, heart failure, and septic shock (table 2). Half of non-survivors experienced a secondary infection, and ventilator-associated pneumonia occurred in ten (31%) of 32 patients requiring invasive mechanical ventilation. The frequency of complications were higher in non-survivors than survivors (table 2).\nRisk factors associated with in-hospital death\n		Univariable OR (95% CI)	p value	Multivariable OR (95% CI)	p value	 	Demographics and clinical characteristics	 	Age, years*	1 14 (1 09-1 18)	&lt;0 0001	1 10 (1 03-1 17)	0 0043	 	Female sex (vs male)	0 61 (0 31-1 20)	0 15	..	..

IL-6=interleukin-6.\nPer 1 unit increase.\nIn univariable analysis, odds of in-hospital death was higher in patients with diabetes or coronary heart disease (table 3 ). Age, lymphopenia, leucocytosis, and elevated ALT, lactate dehydrogenase, high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I, creatine kinase, d-dimer, serum ferritin, IL-6, prothrombin time, creatinine, and procalcitonin were also associated with death (table 3).\nWe included 171 patients with complete data for all variables (53 non-survivors and 118 survivors) in the multivariable logistic regression model. We found that older age, higher SOFA score, and d-dimer greater than 1 mug/mL at admission were associated with increased odds of death (table 3). When adjusting for study centre, our generalised linear model showed similar results (appendix p 5).\nClinical courses of major symptoms and outcomes and duration of viral shedding from illness onset in patients hospitalised with COVID-19\nFigure shows median duration of symptoms and onset of complications and outcomes. ICU=intensive care unit. SARS-CoV-2=severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. ARDS=acute respiratory distress syndrome. COVID-19=coronavirus disease 2019.\nFor survivors, the median duration of viral shedding was 20 0 days (IQR 17 0-24 0) from illness onset, but the virus was continuously detectable until death in non-survivors (table 2; figure 1 ). The shortest observed duration of viral shedding among survivors was 8 days, whereas the longest was 37 days. Among 29 patients who received lopinavir/ritonavir and were discharged, the median time from illness onset to initiation of antiviral treatment was 14 0 days (IQR 10 0-17 0) and the median duration of viral shedding was 22 0 days (18 0-24 0). The median duration of viral shedding was 19 0 days (17 0-22 0) in patients with severe disease status and 24 0 days (22 0-30 0) in patients with critical disease status.\nTemporal changes in laboratory markers from illness onset in patients hospitalised with COVID-19\nFigure shows temporal changes in d-dimer (A), lymphocytes (B), IL-6 (C), serum ferritin (D), high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I (E), and lactate dehydrogenase (F). Differences between survivors and non-survivors were significant for all timepoints shown, except for day 4 after illness onset for d-dimer, IL-6, and high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I. For serum ferritin (D), the median values after day 16 exceeded the upper limit of detection, as indicated by the dashed line. COVID-19=coronavirus disease 2019. IL-6=interleukin-6.\nMajor laboratory markers were tracked from illness onset (figure 2 ). Baseline lymphocyte count was significantly higher in survivors than non-survivors; in survivors, lymphocyte count was lowest on day 7 after illness onset and improved during hospitalisation, whereas severe lymphopenia was observed until death in non-survivors. Levels of d-dimer, high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I, serum ferritin, lactate dehydrogenase, and IL-6 were clearly elevated in non-survivors compared with survivors throughout the clinical course, and increased with illness deterioration (figure 2). In non-survivors, high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I increased rapidly from day 16 after disease onset, whereas lactate dehydrogenase increased for both survivors and non-survivors in the early stage of illness, but decreased from day 13 for survivors.\nMedian time from illness onset to dyspnoea was similar in survivors and non-survivors, with a median duration of dyspnoea of 13 0 days (9 0-16 5) for survivors (table 2; figure 1). In survivors, the median duration of fever was 12 0 days (8 0-13 0) and cough persisted for 19 0 days (IQR 12 0-23 0; figure 1). 62 (45%) survivors still had cough on discharge and 39 (72%) non-survivors still had cough at the time of death. The dynamic profiles of fever, cough, and dyspnoea are shown in the appendix (p 6). Sepsis developed at a median of 9 0 days (7 0-13 0) after illness onset among all patients, followed by ARDS (12 0 days [8 0-15 0]), acute cardiac injury (15 0 days [10 0-17 0]), acute kidney injury (15 0 days [13 0-19 5]), and secondary infection (17 0 days [13 0-19 0]). The initiation time and duration of systematic corticosteroid use was also similar between the two groups. Among non-survivors, the median time from illness onset was 10 0 days (7 0-14 0) to sepsis, 12 0 days (8 0-15 0) to ARDS, 14 5 days (9 5-17 0) to acute cardiac injury, and 17 0 days (13 0-19 0) to secondary infection (figure 1; table 2). Among survivors, secondary infection, acute kidney injury, and acute cardiac injury were observed in one patient each, occurring 9 days (acute kidney injury), 14 days (secondary infection), and 21 days (acute cardiac injury) after illness onset.\nThe median time from dyspnoea to intubation was 10 0 days (IQR 5 0-12 5) for patients who received invasive mechanical ventilation and the time from invasive mechanical ventilation to occurrence of ventilator-associated pneumonia was 8 0 days (2 0-9 0; figure 1).\nDiscussion\nThis retrospective cohort study identified several risk factors for death in adults in Wuhan who were hospitalised with COVID-19. In particular, older age, d-dimer levels greater than 1 mug/mL, and higher SOFA score on admission were associated with higher odds of in-hospital death. Additionally, elevated levels of blood IL-6, high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I, and lactate dehydrogenase and lymphopenia were more commonly seen in severe COVID-19 illness. Sustained viral detection in throat samples was observed in both survivors and non-survivors.\nPreviously, older age has been reported as an important independent predictor of mortality in SARS and MERS. The current study confirmed that increased age was associated with death in patients with COVID-19. Previous studies in macaques inoculated with SARS-CoV found that older macaques had stronger host innate responses to virus infection than younger adults, with an increase in differential expression of genes associated with inflammation, whereas expression of type I interferon beta was reduced. The age-dependent defects in T-cell and B-cell function and the excess production of type 2 cytokines could lead to a deficiency in control of viral replication and more prolonged proinflammatory responses, potentially leading to poor outcome. \nSOFA score is a good diagnostic marker for sepsis and septic shock, and reflects the state and degree of multi-organ dysfunction. Although bacterial infections are usually regarded as a leading cause of sepsis, viral infection can also cause sepsis syndrome. Previously, we determined that sepsis occurred in nearly 40% of adults with community-acquired pneumonia due to viral infection. In the current study, we found that more than half of patients developed sepsis. Additionally, we found that more than 70% of patients had white blood cell count below 10 0 x 109 per L or procalcitonin below 0 25 ng/mL, and no bacterial pathogens were detected in these patients on admission. Sepsis was a common complication, which might be directly caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection, but further research is needed to investigate the pathogenesis of sepsis in COVID-19 illness.\nCardiac complications, including new or worsening heart failure, new or worsening arrhythmia, or myocardial infarction are common in patients with pneumonia. Cardiac arrest occurs in about 3% of inpatients with pneumonia. Risk factors of cardiac events after pneumonia include older age, pre-existing cardiovascular diseases, and greater severity of pneumonia at presentation. Coronary heart disease has also been found to be associated with acute cardiac events and poor outcomes in influenza and other respiratory viral infections. In this study, increased high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I during hospitalisation was found in more than half of those who died. The first autopsy of a 53-year-old woman with chronic renal failure in Jinyintan Hospital showed acute myocardial infarction (data not published; personal communication with a pathologist from the Chinese Academy of Science). About 90% of inpatients with pneumonia had increased coagulation activity, marked by increased d-dimer concentrations. In this study, we found d-dimer greater than 1 mug/mL is associated with fatal outcome of COVID-19. High levels of d-dimer have a reported association with 28-day mortality in patients with infection or sepsis identified in the emergency department. Contributory mechanisms include systemic pro-inflammatory cytokine responses that are mediators of atherosclerosis directly contributing to plaque rupture through local inflammation, induction of procoagulant factors, and haemodynamic changes, which predispose to ischaemia and thrombosis. In addition, angiotensin converting enzyme 2, the receptor for SARS-CoV-2, is expressed on myocytes and vascular endothelial cells, so there is at least theoretical potential possibility of direct cardiac involvement by the virus. Of note, interstitial mononuclear inflammatory infiltrates in heart tissue has been documented in fatal cases of COVID-19, although viral detection studies were not reported. \nThe level and duration of infectious virus replication are important factors in assessing the risk of transmission and guiding decisions regarding isolation of patients. Because coronavirus RNA detection is more sensitive than virus isolation, most studies have used qualitative or quantitative viral RNA tests as a potential marker for infectious coronavirus. For SARS-CoV, viral RNA was detected in respiratory specimens from about a third of patients as long as 4 weeks after disease onset. Similarly, the duration of MERS-CoV RNA detection in lower respiratory specimans persisted for at least 3 weeks, whereas the duration of SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection has not been well characterised. In the current study, we found that the detectable SARS-CoV-2 RNA persisted for a median of 20 days in survivors and that it was sustained until death in non-survivors. This has important implications for both patient isolation decision making and guidance around the length of antiviral treatment. In severe influenza virus infection, prolonged viral shedding was associated with fatal outcome and delayed antiviral treatment was an independent risk factor for prolonged virus detection. Similarly, effective antiviral treatment might improve outcomes in COVID-19, although we did not observe shortening of viral shedding duration after lopinavir/ritonavir treatment in the current study. Randomised clinical trials for lopinavir/ritonavir (ChiCTR2000029308) and intravenous remdesivir (NCT04257656, NCT04252664) in treatment of COVID-19 are currently in progress.\nOur study has some limitations. First, due to the retrospective study design, not all laboratory tests were done in all patients, including lactate dehydrogenase, IL-6, and serum ferritin. Therefore, their role might be underestimated in predicting in-hospital death. Second, patients were sometimes transferred late in their illness to the two included hospitals. Lack of effective antivirals, inadequate adherence to standard supportive therapy, and high-dose corticosteroid use might have also contributed to the poor clinical outcomes in some patients. Third, the estimated duration of viral shedding is limited by the frequency of respiratory specimen collection, lack of quantitative viral RNA detection, and relatively low positive rate of SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection in throat-swabs. Fourth, by excluding patients still in hospital as of Jan 31, 2020, and thus relatively more severe disease at an earlier stage, the case fatality ratio in our study cannot reflect the true mortality of COVID-19. Last but not least, interpretation of our findings might be limited by the sample size. However, by including all adult patients in the two designated hospitals for COVID-19, we believe our study population is representative of cases diagnosed and treated in Wuhan.\nTo the best of our knowledge, this is the largest retrospective cohort study among patients with COVID-19 who have experienced a definite outcome. We found that older age, higher SOFA score, and elevated d-dimer at admission were risk factors for death of adult patients with COVID-19. The prolonged viral shedding provides the rationale for testing novel coronavirus antiviral interventions in efforts to improve outcomes.\n This online publication has been corrected.

associated with a novel coronavirus was reported in Wuhan city, Hubei province, China.\n\n Affected patients were geographically linked with a local wet market as a potential source.\n\n No data on person-to-person or nosocomial transmission have been published to date.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this study, we report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, radiological, and microbiological findings of five patients in a family cluster who presented with unexplained pneumonia after returning to Shenzhen, Guangdong province, China, after a visit to Wuhan, and an additional family member who did not travel to Wuhan.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of genetic sequences from these patients were done.\n\n\nFindings\nFrom Jan 10, 2020, we enrolled a family of six patients who travelled to Wuhan from Shenzhen between Dec 29, 2019 and Jan 4, 2020. Of six family members who travelled to Wuhan, five were identified as infected with the novel coronavirus.\n\n Additionally, one family member, who did not travel to Wuhan, became infected with the virus after several days of contact with four of the family members.\n\n None of the family members had contacts with Wuhan markets or animals, although two had visited a Wuhan hospital.\n\n Five family members (aged 36–66 years) presented with fever, upper or lower respiratory tract symptoms, or diarrhoea, or a combination of these 3–6 days after exposure.\n\n They presented to our hospital (The University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen) 6–10 days after symptom onset.\n\n They and one asymptomatic child (aged 10 years) had radiological ground-glass lung opacities.\n\n Older patients (aged &gt;60 years) had more systemic symptoms, extensive radiological ground-glass lung changes, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and increased C-reactive protein and lactate dehydrogenase levels.\n\n The nasopharyngeal or throat swabs of these six patients were negative for known respiratory microbes by point-of-care multiplex RT-PCR, but five patients (four adults and the child) were RT-PCR positive for genes encoding the internal RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and surface Spike protein of this novel coronavirus, which were confirmed by Sanger sequencing.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these five patients' RT-PCR amplicons and two full genomes by next-generation sequencing showed that this is a novel coronavirus, which is closest to the bat severe acute respiatory syndrome (SARS)-related coronaviruses found in Chinese horseshoe bats.\n\n\nInterpretation\nOur findings are consistent with person-to-person transmission of this novel coronavirus in hospital and family settings, and the reports of infected travellers in other geographical regions.\n\n\nFunding\nThe Shaw Foundation Hong Kong, Michael Seak-Kan Tong, Respiratory Viral Research Foundation Limited, Hui

outcomes in patients with a number of different malignancies.\n\n The objective of this study was to assess the relationship between NLR and mortality in a population of adult critically ill patients.\n\n\nMethods\nWe performed an observational cohort study of unselected intensive care unit (ICU) patients based on records in a large clinical database.\n\n We computed individual patient NLR and categorized patients by quartile of this ratio.\n\n The association of NLR quartiles and 28-day mortality was assessed using multivariable logistic regression.\n\n Secondary outcomes included mortality in the ICU, in-hospital mortality and 1-year mortality.\n\n An a priori subgroup analysis of patients with versus without sepsis was performed to assess any differences in the relationship between the NLR and outcomes in these cohorts.\n\n\nResults\nA total of 5,056 patients were included.\n\n Their 28-day mortality rate was 19%.\n\n The median age of the cohort was 65 years, and 47% were female.\n\n The median NLR for the entire cohort was 8.9 (interquartile range, 4.99 to 16.21).\n\n Following multivariable adjustments, there was a stepwise increase in mortality with increasing quartiles of NLR (first quartile: reference category; second quartile odds ratio (OR) = 1.32; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.03 to 1.71; third quartile OR = 1.43; 95% CI, 1.12 to 1.83; 4th quartile OR = 1.71; 95% CI, 1.35 to 2.16).\n\n A similar stepwise relationship was identified in the subgroup of patients who presented without sepsis.\n\n The NLR was not associated with 28-day mortality in

recently reported in Wuhan, Hubei province, China.\n As of 25 January 2020, at least 1,975 cases had been reported since the first patient was hospitalized on 12 December 2019. Epidemiological investigations have suggested that the outbreak was associated with a seafood market in Wuhan.\n Here we study a single patient who was a worker at the market and who was admitted to the Central Hospital of Wuhan on 26 December 2019 while experiencing a severe respiratory syndrome that included fever, dizziness and a cough.\n Metagenomic RNA sequencing4 of a sample of

coronavirus in Wuhan, China","abstract":"Background\nA recent cluster of pneumonia cases in Wuhan, China, was caused by a novel betacoronavirus, the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).\n\n We report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatment and clinical outcomes of these patients.\n\n\nMethods\nAll patients with suspected 2019-nCoV were admitted to a designated hospital in Wuhan.\n\n We prospectively collected and analysed data on patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection by real-time RT-PCR and next-generation sequencing.\n\n Data were obtained with standardised data collection forms shared by WHO and the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium from electronic medical records.\n\n Researchers also directly communicated with patients or their families to ascertain epidemiological and symptom data.\n\n Outcomes were also compared between patients who had been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and those who had not.\n\n\nFindings\nBy Jan 2, 2020, 41 admitted hospital patients had been identified as having laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection.\n\n Most of the infected patients were men (30 [73%] of 41); less than half had underlying diseases (13 [32%]), including diabetes (eight [20%]), hypertension (six [15%]), and cardiovascular disease (six [15%]).\n\n Median age was 49·0 years (IQR 41·0–58·0).\n\n 27 (66%) of 41 patients had been exposed to Huanan seafood market.\n\n One family cluster was found.\n\n Common symptoms at onset of illness were fever (40 [98%] of 41 patients), cough (31 [76%]), and myalgia or fatigue (18 [44%]); less common symptoms were sputum production (11 [28%] of 39), headache (three [8%] of 38), haemoptysis (two [5%] of 39), and diarrhoea (one [3%] of 38).\n\n Dyspnoea developed in 22 (55%) of 40 patients (median time from illness onset to dyspnoea 8·0 days [IQR 5·0–13·0]).\n\n 26 (63%) of 41 patients had lymphopenia.\n\n All 41 patients had pneumonia with abnormal findings on chest CT.\n\n Complications included acute respiratory distress syndrome (12 [29%]), RNAaemia (six [15%]), acute cardiac injury (five [12%]) and secondary infection (four [10%]).\n\n 13 (32%) patients were admitted to an ICU and six (15%) died.\n\n Compared with non-ICU patients, ICU patients had higher plasma levels of IL2, IL7, IL10, GSCF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNF?.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe 2019-nCoV infection caused clusters of severe respiratory illness similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and was associated with ICU admission and high mortality.\n\n Major gaps in our knowledge of the origin, epidemiology, duration of human transmission, and clinical spectrum of disease need fulfilment by future studies.\n\n\nFunding\nMinistry of Science and Technology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, National Natural Science Foundation of China, and Beijing Municipal Science and Technology

Demographic data, symptoms, laboratory values, comorbidities, treatments, and clinical outcomes were all collected.\n\n Data were compared between survivors and non-survivors.\n\n The primary outcome was 28-day mortality, as of Feb 9, 2020. Secondary outcomes included incidence of SARS-CoV-2-related acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and the proportion of patients requiring mechanical ventilation.\n\n\nFindings\nOf 710 patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, 52 critically ill adult patients were included.\n\n The mean age of the 52 patients was 59·7 (SD 13·3) years, 35 (67%) were men, 21 (40%) had chronic illness, 51 (98%) had fever.\n\n 32 (61·5%) patients had died at 28 days, and the median duration from admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) to death was 7 (IQR 3–11) days for non-survivors.\n\n Compared with survivors, non-survivors were older (64·6 years [11·2] vs 51·9 years [12·9]), more likely to develop ARDS (26 [81%] patients vs 9 [45%] patients), and more likely to receive mechanical ventilation (30 [94%] patients vs 7 [35%] patients), either invasively or non-invasively.\n\n Most patients had organ function damage, including 35 (67%) with ARDS, 15 (29%) with acute kidney injury, 12 (23%) with cardiac injury, 15 (29%) with liver dysfunction, and one (2%) with pneumothorax.\n\n 37 (71%) patients required mechanical ventilation.\n\n Hospital-acquired infection occurred in seven (13·5%) patients.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe mortality of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia is considerable.\n\n The survival time of the non-survivors is likely to be within 1–2 weeks after ICU admission.\n\n Older patients (&gt;65 years) with comorbidities and ARDS are at increased risk of death.\n\n The severity of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia poses great strain on critical care resources in hospitals, especially if they are not adequately staffed or resourced.\n\n\nFunding\nNone.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7102538","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Elsevier

of small cytokines and generally have low molecular weight ranging from 7 to 15kDa.\n Chemokines and their receptors are able to control the migration and residence of all immune cells.\n Some chemokines are considered pro-inflammatory, and their release can be induced during an immune response at a site of infection, while others are considered homeostatic and are involved in controlling of cells migration during tissue development or maintenance.\n The physiologic importance of this family of mediators is resulting from their specificity ? members of the chemokine family induce recruitment of well-defined leukocyte subsets.\n There are two major chemokine sub-families based upon cysteine residues position: CXC and CC.\n As a general rule, members of the CXC chemokines are chemotactic for neutrophils, and CC chemokines are chemotactic for monocytes and sub-set of lymphocytes, although there are some exceptions.\n This review discusses the potential role of chemokines in

Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) was first identified in Saudi Arabia and the Middle East in September, 2012, with 44 laboratory-confirmed cases as of May 23, 2013. We report detailed clinical and virological data for two related cases of MERS-CoV disease, after nosocomial transmission of the virus from one patient to another in a French hospital.\n\n\nMethods\nPatient 1 visited Dubai in April, 2013; patient 2 lives in France and did not travel abroad.\n\n Both patients had underlying immunosuppressive disorders.\n\n We tested specimens from the upper (nasopharyngeal swabs) or the lower (bronchoalveolar lavage, sputum) respiratory tract and whole blood, plasma, and serum specimens for MERS-CoV by real-time RT-PCR targeting the upE and Orf1A genes of MERS-CoV.\n\n\nFindings\nInitial clinical presentation included fever, chills, and myalgia in both patients, and for patient 1, diarrhoea.\n\n Respiratory symptoms rapidly became predominant with acute respiratory failure leading to mechanical ventilation and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO).\n\n Both patients developed acute renal failure.\n\n MERS-CoV was detected in lower respiratory tract specimens with high viral load (eg, cycle threshold [Ct] values of 22·9 for upE and 24 for Orf1a for a bronchoalveolar lavage sample from patient 1; Ct values of 22·5 for upE and 23·9 for Orf1a for an induced sputum sample from patient 2), whereas nasopharyngeal specimens were weakly positive or inconclusive.\n\n The two patients shared the same room for 3 days.\n\n The incubation period was estimated at 9–12 days for the second case.\n\n No secondary transmission was documented in hospital staff despite the absence of specific protective measures before the diagnosis of MERS-CoV was suspected.\n\n Patient 1 died on May 28, due to refractory multiple organ failure.\n\n\nInterpretation\nPatients with respiratory symptoms returning from the Middle East or exposed to a confirmed case should be isolated and investigated for MERS-CoV with lower respiratory tract sample analysis and an assumed incubation period of 12 days.\n\n Immunosuppression should also be taken into account as a risk factor.\n\n\nFunding\nFrench Institute for Public Health Surveillance, ANR grant Labex Integrative Biology of Emerging Infectious

host cells","abstract":"id='Par1'>In face of the everlasting battle toward COVID-19 and the rapid evolution of SARS-CoV-2, no specific and effective drugs for treating this disease have been reported until today.\n Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), a receptor of SARS-CoV-2, mediates the virus infection by binding to spike protein.\n Although ACE2 is expressed in the lung, kidney, and intestine, its expressing levels are rather low, especially in the lung.\n Considering the great infectivity of COVID-19, we speculate that SARS-CoV-2 may depend on other routes to facilitate its infection.\n Here, we first discover an interaction between host cell receptor CD147 and SARS-CoV-2 spike protein.\n The loss of CD147 or blocking CD147 in Vero E6 and BEAS-2B cell lines by anti-CD147 antibody, Meplazumab, inhibits SARS-CoV-2 amplification.\n Expression of human CD147 allows virus entry into non-susceptible BHK-21 cells, which can be neutralized by CD147 extracellular fragment.\n Viral loads are detectable in the lungs of human CD147 (hCD147) mice infected with SARS-CoV-2, but not in those of virus-infected wild type mice.\n Interestingly, virions are observed in lymphocytes of lung tissue from a COVID-19 patient.\n Human T cells with a property of ACE2 natural deficiency can be infected with SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus in a dose-dependent manner, which is specifically inhibited by Meplazumab.\n Furthermore, CD147 mediates virus entering host cells by endocytosis.\n Together, our study reveals a novel virus entry route, CD147-spike protein, which provides an important target for developing specific and effective drug against COVID-19.","id":"PMC7714896","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Nature Publishing Group

limited and systematic screening of pilgrims showed no infections.\n\n\nConclusions\nWell conducted multinational follow-up studies using the same methodology of testing are necessary for accurate surveillance of respiratory viral infections among Hajj pilgrims.\n\n Post-Hajj cohort studies would further evaluate the impact of the Hajj on the acquisition of respiratory viruses.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7110954","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Elsevier Ltd.","authors":[{"firstname":"Jaffar

Meta-Analysis of Randomized Controlled Trials","abstract":"\nWhat Is Known and Objective.\n To reevaluate the benefits and risks of corticosteroid treatment in adult patients with septic shock.\n Methods.\n This study was performed based on PRISMA guidelines.\n Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of corticosteroids versus placebo were retrieved from PubMed, MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Science, the Cochrane Central RCTs, and ClinicalTrials.\ngov from January 1980 to April 2018. We also conducted a trial sequential analysis to indicate the possibility of type I or II errors and calculate the information size.\n Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation approach (GRADE) was applying to assess the certainty of evidence at the primary outcome level.\n Results.\n Twenty-one RCTs were identified and analyzed.\n Patients treated with corticosteroid had a 7% reduction in relative risk in 28-day all-cause mortality compared to controls (RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.88 to 0.99).\n However, there were no significant differences for the intensive care unit (ICU) mortality (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.09) or in-hospital mortality (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.11).\n Corticosteroids shortened the length of ICU stay by 1.04 days (RR -1.04, 95% CI -1.72 to -0.36) and the length of hospital stay by 2.49 days (RR -2.49, 95% CI -4.96 to -0.02).\n Corticosteroids increased the risk of hyperglycemia (RR 1.11, 95% CI 1.06 to 1.16) but not gastroduodenal bleeding (RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.37) or superinfection (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.15).\n However, some date on secondary outcomes were unavailable because they were not measured or not reported in the included studies which may cause a lack of power or selective outcome reporting.\n The information size was calculated at 10044 patients.\n Trial sequential analysis showed that the meta-analysis was conclusive and the risk of type 2 error was minimal.\n What Is New and Conclusion.\n Corticosteroids are likely to be effective in reducing 28-day mortality and attenuating septic shock without increasing the rate of life-threatening complications.\n TSA showed that the risk of type II error in this meta-analysis was minimal and the result was conclusive.\n","id":"PMC6590573","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Hindawi","authors":[{"firstname":"X.-J.","surname":"Lian","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"D.-Z.","surname":"Huang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Y.-S.","surname":"Cao","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Y.-X.","surname":"Wei","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Z.-Z.","surname":"Lian","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"T.-H.","surname":"Qin","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"P.-C.","surname":"He","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Y.-H.","surname":"Liu","email":"lyh0718@126.com","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"S.-H.","surname":"Wang","email":"wshdoctor@139.com","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"S.-H.","surname":"Wang","email":"wshdoctor@139.com","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1016/j.ajem.2018.11.040","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Can corticosteroids reduce the mortality of patients with severe sepsis?

OBservational studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) statements—do not capture the complexity of pharmacoepidemiological research.\n We have therefore extended the RECORD statement to include reporting guidelines specific to pharmacoepidemiological research (RECORD-PE).\n This article includes the RECORD-PE checklist (also available on www.\nrecord-statement.\norg) and explains each checklist item with examples of good reporting.\n We anticipate that increasing use of the RECORD-PE guidelines by researchers and endorsement and adherence by journal editors will improve the standards of reporting of pharmacoepidemiological research undertaken using routinely collected data.\n This improved transparency will benefit the research community, patient care, and ultimately improve public health.\n","id":"PMC6234471","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"BMJ Publishing Group Ltd.","authors":[{"firstname":"Sinéad

of treatment selection, conditional on observed baseline covariates.\n Weighting subjects by the inverse probability of treatment received creates a synthetic sample in which treatment assignment is independent of measured baseline covariates.\n Inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) using the propensity score allows one to obtain unbiased estimates of average treatment effects.\n However, these estimates are only valid if there are no residual systematic differences in observed baseline characteristics between treated and control subjects in the sample weighted by the estimated inverse probability of treatment.\n We report on a systematic literature review, in which we found that the use of IPTW has increased rapidly in recent years, but that in the most recent year, a majority of studies did not formally examine whether weighting balanced measured covariates between treatment groups.\n We then proceed to describe a suite of quantitative and qualitative methods that allow one to assess whether measured baseline covariates are balanced between treatment groups in the weighted sample.\n The quantitative methods use the weighted standardized difference to compare means, prevalences, higher?order moments, and interactions.\n The qualitative methods employ graphical methods to compare the distribution of continuous baseline covariates between treated and control subjects in the weighted sample.\n Finally, we illustrate the application of these methods in an empirical case study.\n We propose a formal set of balance diagnostics that contribute towards an evolving concept of ‘best practice’ when using IPTW to estimate causal treatment effects using observational data.\n © 2015 The Authors.\n Statistics in Medicine Published by John Wiley

treatments or exposures.\n A popular method of using the propensity score is inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW).\n When using this method, a weight is calculated for each subject that is equal to the inverse of the probability of receiving the treatment that was actually received.\n These weights are then incorporated into the analyses to minimize the effects of observed confounding.\n Previous research has found that these methods result in unbiased estimation when estimating the effect of treatment on survival outcomes.\n However, conventional methods of variance estimation were shown to result in biased estimates of standard error.\n In this study, we conducted an extensive set of Monte Carlo simulations to examine different methods of variance estimation when using a weighted Cox proportional hazards model to estimate the effect of treatment.\n We considered three variance estimation methods: (i) a naïve model?based variance estimator; (ii) a robust sandwich?type variance estimator; and (iii) a bootstrap variance estimator.\n We considered estimation of both the average treatment effect and the average treatment effect in the treated.\n We found that the use of a bootstrap estimator resulted in approximately correct estimates of standard errors and confidence intervals with the correct coverage rates.\n The other estimators resulted in biased estimates of standard errors and confidence intervals with incorrect coverage rates.\n Our simulations were informed by a case study examining the effect of statin prescribing on mortality.\n © 2016

corticosteroids, and assessed the pattern of clinical disease, viral load, risk factors for poor clinical outcome, and the usefulness of virological diagnostic methods.\n\n\nFindings\nFever and pneumonia initially improved but 64 (85%) patients developed recurrent fever after a mean of 8.9 (SD 3.1) days, 55 (73%) had watery diarrhoea after 7.5 (2.3) days, 60 (80%) had radiological worsening after 7.4 (2.2) days, and respiratory symptoms worsened in 34 (45%) after 8.6 (3.0) days.\n\n In 34 (45%) patients, improvement of initial pulmonary lesions was associated with appearance of new radiological lesions at other sites.\n\n Nine (12%) patients developed spontaneous pneumomediastinum and 15 (20%) developed acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in week 3. Quantitative reverse-transcriptase (RT) PCR of nasopharyngeal aspirates in 14 patients (four with ARDS) showed peak viral load at day 10, and at day 15 a load lower than at admission.\n\n Age and chronic hepatitis B virus infection treated with lamivudine were independent significant risk factors for progression to ARDS (p=0.001).\n\n SARS-associated coronavirus in faeces was seen on RT-PCR in 65 (97%) of 67 patients at day 14. The mean time to seroconversion was 20 days.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe consistent clinical progression, shifting radiological infiltrates, and an inverted V viral-load profile suggest that worsening in week 2 is unrelated to uncontrolled viral replication but may be related to immunopathological damage.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7112410","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Elsevier Ltd.","authors":[{"firstname":"JSM","surname":"Peiris","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"CM","surname":"Chu","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"VCC","surname":"Cheng","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"KS","surname":"Chan","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"IFN","surname":"Hung","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"LLM","surname":"Poon","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"KI","surname":"Law","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"BSF","surname":"Tang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"TYW","surname":"Hon","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"CS","surname":"Chan","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"KH","surname":"Chan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"JSC","surname":"Ng","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"BJ","surname":"Zheng","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"WL","surname":"Ng","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"RWM","surname":"Lai","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Y","surname":"Guan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"KY","surname":"Yuen","email":"kyyuen@hkucc.hku.hk","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"NULL","surname":"NULL","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Profile of specific antibodies to the SARS-associated coronavirus","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Serology of severe acute respiratory syndrome: implications for surveillance and outcome","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"SARS-CoV antibody prevalence in all Hong Kong patient contacts","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Early diagnosis of SARS coronavirus infection by real time RT-PCR","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Detection of SARS coronavirus in patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome by conventional and real-time quantitative reverse transcription-PCR assays","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Detection of SARS coronavirus in patients with suspected SARS","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Preclinical evaluation of two real-time, reverse transcription-PCR assays for detection of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"World Health Organization (2003) PCR primers for SARS developed by WHO network laboratories [monograph on the Internet].

There have been more than 600,000 patients with confirmed Covid-19 worldwide by the end of March 2020. One of the key issues has been the very high volume of patients presenting to health centers or hospitals during the outbreak. It clearly overwhelms the human and mechanistic capacities available, especially the need for critical care support. As such, risk stratification measures would clearly be helpful. Therefore, early and effective predictors of clinical outcomes are urgent needed for risk stratification of Covid-19 patients. D-dimer originates from the formation and lysis of cross-linked fibrin and reflects activation of coagulation and fibrinolysis. It has been reported that Covid-19 was associated with hemostatic abnormalities, and markedly elevated D-dimer levels were observed in those nonsurvivors. However, the prognosis value and the optimal cutoff value for D-dimer on admission to predict mortality have not been well evaluated.\nMETHODS\nStudy design and participants\nThe study was a retrospective study conducted in Wuhan Asia General Hospital (Wuhan, China), which was a designated hospital for Covid-19 patients. Adult (aged 18 years or older) patients with laboratory-confirmed Covid-19 between January 12, 2020, and March 15, 2020, were retrospectively screened. The diagnosis of Covid-19 was according to World Health Organization interim guidance and confirmed by RNA detection of the SARS-CoV-2 in onsite clinical laboratory. A total of 343 participants who had a D-dimer level on admission and had a definite outcome (dead or survival) were enrolled. The study was approved and the requirement for informed consent was waived by the Ethics Commission (WAGHMEC-KY-202004).\nData collection\nAll clinical, laboratory, and outcome data were extracted from electronic medical records using a standardized data collection form. All data were checked by two physicians (S.Y. and X.L.), and a third researcher (Z.L.) adjudicated any difference in interpretation between the two primary reviewers.\nLaboratory assay and intervention\nBlood samples were collected within 24 hours after admission to perform routine laboratory tests, such as blood count, coagulation profile, and serum biochemical tests (including renal and liver function) in an onsite laboratory. D-dimer was determined on CS5100 automatic coagulation analyzer (Sysmex, Kobe, Japan) by using a latex-enhanced photometric immunoassay (Siemens, Marburg, Germany). Inter- and intra-day variability coefficients were 3.41% and 4.22%. The laboratory reference range was 0 to 0.5 microg/mL. The D-dimer result was expressed in microg/mL fibrinogen equivalent unit. All measurements were done within 2 hours after blood sampling.\nStatistical analysis\nContinuous and categorical variables were presented as mean +- standard deviation or median (interquartile range [IQR]), as appropriate. Categorical variables were presented as n (%). Event frequencies were compared with chi-squared test. Other comparisons between two groups were made with unpaired Student t test or Mann-Whitney U test. The optimal D-dimer cutoff point and C-statistic of routine tests were evaluated by receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve. The outcomes were compared by Kaplan-Meier survival analysis. Hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidential interval (95% CI) were calculated by log-rank tests. The prognostic values of D-dimer and clinical variables were analyzed with Cox-proportional hazard models. A value of P &lt; .05 was accepted as statistically significant. The statistical software package MedCalc Statistical Software (version 16.2, Ostend, Belgium) was used for analyses.\nRESULTS\nBaseline characteristics and establishing optimum cutoff value for D-dimer\nBaseline characteristics of 343 patients with Covid-19\nTable 1	 	\nVariable	Totaln = 343	D-dimer &lt; 2.0n = 276	D-dimer &gt;= 2.0n = 67	P Value	 	Age (IQR), y	62.0 (48.0, 69.0)	59.0 (43.5, 68.0)	70.0 (62.2, 76.0)	&lt;.001	 	Age &gt; 65, n (%), y	129 (37.6)	88 (33.0)	41 (53.9)	&lt;.001	 	Female, n (%)	174 (50.7)	145 (54.3)	29 (38.2)	.22	 	Underlying conditions, n (%)	120 (35.0)	79 (29.6)	41 (53.9)	&lt;.001	 	Diabetes, n (%)	47 (13.7)	31 (11.6)	16 (21.1)	.007	 	Hypertension, n (%)	76 (22.2)	50 (18.7)	26 (34.2)	&lt;.001	 	Coronary heart disease, n (%)	19 (5.5)	11 (4.1)	8 (10.5)	.02	 	COPD, n (%)	8 (2.3)	4 (1.5)	4 (5.3)	.05	 	Cancer, n (%)	9 (2.6)	5 (1.9)	4 (5.3)	.08	 	Stroke history, n (%)	8 (2.3)	2 (0.7)	6 (7.9)	&lt;.001	 	Chronic kidney disease, n (%)	4 (1.2)	4 (1.5)	0 (0.0)	1.0	 	Atrial fibrillation, n (%)	4 (1.2)	2 (0.7)	2 (2.6)	.17	 	Chronic liver disease, n (%)	6 (1.7)	5 (1.9)	1 (1.3)	1.0	 	Routine tests on admission	 	White blood cell, 109/L	6.66 +- 4.27	6.47 +- 4.38	7.44 +- 3.72	.09	 	Lymphocyte, 109/L (IQR)	1.36 (0.88, 1.76)	1.44 (1.03, 1.83)	0.83 (0.58, 1.24)	&lt;.001	 	Neutrophil, 109/L (IQR)	3.68 (2.80, 5.06)	3.51 (2.71, 4.81)	4.71 (3.42, 7.32)	&lt;.001	 	Hemoglobin, 109/L (IQR)	127 (115, 137)	127 (117, 139)	122 (110, 134)	.003	 	Platelet, 109/L	242.8 +- 92.3	249.3 +- 88.6	216 +- 102.7	.009	 	CRP, mg/L (IQR)	3.22 (0.34, 22.5)	1.69 (0.32, 16.6)	13.6(1.77, 62.8)	&lt;.001	 	Direct bilirubin	4.82 +- 1.46	4.83 +- 1.49	4.76 +- 1.34	.74	 	ALT, U/mL	28 (16, 49)	28 (16, 47)	30.5 (17, 60)	.34	 	Creatinine, mumol/L (IQR)	72 (59, 85)	70 (59, 83)	76 (64, 99)	.026	 	Prothrombin time, s (IQR)	11.7(11.2, 12.3)	11.6 (11.1, 12.2)	12.3 (11.6, 13.1)	&lt;.001	 	aPTT, s	29.4 +- 4.5	29.6 +- 4.3	28.8 +- 5.2	.21	 	Fibrinogen, g/L (IQR)	4.1(3.1, 5.1)	4.1(3.1, 5.1)	4.3(3.2, 5.6)	.54	 	D-dimer, mug/mL (IQR)	0.54 (0.20, 1.41)	0.41 (0.15, 0.69)	4.76 (2.99, 11.9)	&lt;.001	 	D-dimer &lt;=0.5 mug/mL, n (%)	164	/	/	/	 	Hospital stay, d	29 (21, 30)	29 (22, 30)	29 (19, 30)	.31	 	Nonsurvivors, n (%)	13 (3.8)	1 (0.4)	12 (15.8)	&lt;.001	 	\nNote:Data are mean +- standard deviation, median (IQR), n (%).

A total of 37.6% (129/343) patients were older than 65 years and 50.3% (174/343) patients were female. Listed in Table 1 are the basic clinical characteristics of the patients, including age, gender, comorbidities, and routine laboratory results on admission. A total of 13 all-cause deaths occurred during hospitalization. The optimum cutoff value for D-dimer to predict all-cause deaths was 2.0 microg/mL using ROC curve (Figure 1 ) with a sensitivity of 92.3% and a specificity of 83.3%. Area under the ROC curve for all-cause deaths was 0.89. Among routine laboratory tests, D-dimer has the highest C-index to predict in-hospital mortality in Covid-19 patients (Table 2 ). Besides, The C-indices indicates lymphocyte, prothrombin time, and C-reaction protein are also strong predictors for these patients (Table 2).\nAccording to the optimum cutoff value, 276 patients' D-dimer levels on admission were less than 2.0 microg/mL, and 67 patients had D-dimer levels over 2.0 microg/mL. Compared with those patients with D-dimer levels below 2.0 mug/mL, patients with D-dimer levels &gt;=2.0 microg/mL had a higher incidence of underlying disease, such as diabetes (P = .007), hypertension (P &lt; .001), coronary heart disease (P = .02), and stroke history (P &lt; .001). Additionally, lower level of lymphocyte (P &lt; .001), hemoglobin (P = .003), platelet count (P = .009), and higher level of neutrophil (P &lt; .001), C-reactive protein (P &lt; .001), and prothrombin time (P &lt; .001) were also observed in those with D-dimer levels &gt;=2.0 microg/mL.\nHigh D-dimer levels to predict mortality\nKaplan-Meier survival curves for D-dimer levels on admission.

Kaplan-Meier survival curves (Figure 2 ) for D-dimer levels showed that D-dimer level &gt;=2.0microg/mL was the significant predictor of subsequent deaths (P &lt; .001; HR, 51.5; 95% CI, 12.9-206.7). Statistical significance of separation between two groups was achieved at 7 days. Cox proportional hazard analysis showed that high D-dimer level was also a significant determinant (P = .003, adjusted HR, 22.4; 95% CI, 2.86-175.7) after adjustment of gender, age, with or without underlying disease.\nDISCUSSION\nThe main finding of this study is that D-dimer on admission greater than 2.0 microg/mL was the independent predictor of in hospital death for patients with Covid-19. This finding provides a well-established cutoff value to identify those patients with Covid-19 who have poor prognosis at an early stage.\nD-dimer elevation has been reported to be one of the most common laboratory findings noted in Covid-19 patients requiring hospitalization. Guan and colleagues analyzed 1099 patients with laboratory-confirmed Covid-19 from more than 550 hospitals in China, and found the nonsurvivors had a significantly higher D-dimer (median, 2.12 mug/mL) than that of survivors (median, 0.61 mug/mL). Similarly, Ning et al also observed abnormal coagulation results, especially markedly elevated D-dimer in deaths with Covid-19. Fei et al conducted a retrospective study involved 191 patients with Covid-19, and found that D-dimer greater than 1 microg/mL on admission was associated with in-hospital death (HR, 18.42; 95% CI, 2.64-128.55). Huang and colleagues showed D-dimer levels on admission were higher in patients needing critical care support than those who did not require it (median, 0.5 microg/mL). However, these previous studies did not provide well evaluated cutoff for D-dimer. Therefore, a recent guidance on recognition and management of coagulopathy in Covid-19 from International Society of Thrombosis and Haemostasis &quot;arbitrarily defined markedly raised D-dimers on admission as three-four folds increas.e&quot; In current study, a clear cutoff value (2.0 microg/mL, fourfold increase) for D-dimer was well established by ROC curve. Notably, of 12 nonsurvivors with D-dimers &gt;=2.0 microg/mL, 7 had no severity symptoms on admission. Thus, for patients who have markedly raised D-dimers (cutoff, 2.0 microg/mL; four-fold increase), admission to hospital and closely monitoring should be considered even in the absence of other severity symptoms.\nElevation of D-dimer indicated a hypercoagulable state in patient with Covid-19, which might be attributed to several reasons as follows. First, virus infections are usually accompanied by an aggressive pro-inflammatory response and insufficient control of an anti-inflammatory response. It might induce the dysfunction of endothelial cells, resulting in excess thrombin generation. Second, the hypoxia found in severe Covid-19 can stimulate thrombosis through not only increasing blood viscosity, but also a hypoxia-inducible transcription factor-dependent signaling pathway. Third, hospitalized patients, especially severe patients with Covid-19, were more prone to have older ages, underlying conditions, long-term bed rest, and invasive treatment, which were all risk factors of hypercoagulation or thrombosis. As evidence, the lung organ dissection of critical patient with Covid-19 have reported occlusion and microthrombosis formation in pulmonary small vessels. Fourth, some patients might develop to sepsis-induced coagulopathy or even disseminated intravascular coagulation. Elevated D-dimer was always associated with unfavorable events. Previously, the lack of specificity has been regarded as a disadvantage of D-dimer. However, low specificity has been transformed into one of its advantages in the evaluation of prognosis.\nThis study has several limitations. First, our study might have selection bias because it was a single-center, retrospective study, even if it had sufficient power to detect the significant differences between groups in mortality. Despite our efforts to include all qualified patients, some patients still excluded in enrollment because of absence of D-dimer levels on admission. Second, because of differences in patient size and medical resources, the lengths from illness onset to admission of the included patients might not be representative, which might influence D-dimer levels on admission. In addition, the half-life of D-dimer was approximately 8 hours; therefore, dynamic measurement of D-dimer will reveal more information. Third, the fully adjusted model analysis for HR was not performed, given the low number of events. Fourth, a multiple-parameter prediction model including D-dimer and other variables might provide better predictive ability for Covid-19 patients.\nCONCLUSION\nD-dimer on admission greater than 2.0 microg/mL (fourfold increase) could effectively predict in-hospital mortality in patients with Covid-19, which indicated D-dimer could be an early and helpful marker to improve management of Covid-19 patients.\nCONFLICTS OF INTEREST\nThe authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest regarding this article.\nThis work was supported by the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission (WX19Q03).\nAUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONS\nLitao Zhang drafted the manuscript; Litao Zhang, Xinsheng Yan, Haiyan Liu, Xintian Liu, and Zejin Liu collected and analyzed the data; Litao Zhang and Qingkun Fan interpreted the data; and Litao Zhang and Zhenlu Zhang designed the study.\nREFERENCES\nClinical features of patients infected with 2019 novel coronavirus in Wuhan, China\nClinical characteristics of 138 hospitalized patients with 2019 novel coronavirus-infected pneumonia in Wuhan, China\nCoronavirus disease (COVID-19) Pandemic.2020. https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019.\nJohns Hopkins University CSSE.

Of six family members who travelled to Wuhan, five were identified as infected with the novel coronavirus.\n\n Additionally, one family member, who did not travel to Wuhan, became infected with the virus after several days of contact with four of the family members.\n\n None of the family members had contacts with Wuhan markets or animals, although two had visited a Wuhan hospital.\n\n Five family members (aged 36–66 years) presented with fever, upper or lower respiratory tract symptoms, or diarrhoea, or a combination of these 3–6 days after exposure.\n\n They presented to our hospital (The University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen) 6–10 days after symptom onset.\n\n They and one asymptomatic child (aged 10 years) had radiological ground-glass lung opacities.\n\n Older patients (aged &gt;60 years) had more systemic symptoms, extensive radiological ground-glass lung changes, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and increased C-reactive protein and lactate dehydrogenase levels.\n\n The nasopharyngeal or throat swabs of these six patients were negative for known respiratory microbes by point-of-care multiplex RT-PCR, but five patients (four adults and the child) were RT-PCR positive for genes encoding the internal RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and surface Spike protein of this novel coronavirus, which were confirmed by Sanger sequencing.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these five patients' RT-PCR amplicons and two full genomes by next-generation sequencing showed that this is a novel coronavirus, which is closest to the bat severe acute respiatory syndrome (SARS)-related coronaviruses found in Chinese horseshoe bats.\n\n\nInterpretation\nOur findings are consistent with person-to-person transmission of this novel coronavirus in hospital and family settings, and the reports of infected travellers in other geographical regions.\n\n\nFunding\nThe Shaw Foundation Hong Kong, Michael Seak-Kan Tong, Respiratory Viral Research Foundation Limited, Hui

January 2020. We analyzed data on the first 425 confirmed cases in Wuhan to determine the epidemiologic characteristics of NCIP.\n\n\nMethods\nWe collected information on demographic characteristics, exposure history, and illness timelines of laboratory-confirmed cases of NCIP that had been reported by January 22, 2020. We described characteristics of the cases and estimated the key epidemiologic time-delay distributions.\n\n In the early period of exponential growth, we estimated the epidemic doubling time and the basic reproductive number.\n\n\nResults\nAmong the first 425 patients with confirmed NCIP, the median age was 59 years and 56% were male.\n\n The majority of cases (55%) with onset before January 1, 2020, were linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, as compared with 8.6% of the subsequent cases.\n\n The mean incubation period was 5.2 days (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.1 to 7.0), with the 95th percentile of the distribution at 12.5 days.\n\n In its early stages, the epidemic doubled in size every 7.4 days.\n\n With a mean serial interval of 7.5 days (95% CI, 5.3 to 19), the basic reproductive number was estimated to be 2.2 (95% CI, 1.4 to 3.9).\n\n\nConclusions\nOn the basis of this information, there is evidence that human-to-human transmission has occurred among close contacts since the middle of December 2019.

outcomes in patients with a number of different malignancies.\n\n The objective of this study was to assess the relationship between NLR and mortality in a population of adult critically ill patients.\n\n\nMethods\nWe performed an observational cohort study of unselected intensive care unit (ICU) patients based on records in a large clinical database.\n\n We computed individual patient NLR and categorized patients by quartile of this ratio.\n\n The association of NLR quartiles and 28-day mortality was assessed using multivariable logistic regression.\n\n Secondary outcomes included mortality in the ICU, in-hospital mortality and 1-year mortality.\n\n An a priori subgroup analysis of patients with versus without sepsis was performed to assess any differences in the relationship

city.\n\n The most common symptoms were fever (43.8% on admission and 88.7% during hospitalization) and cough (67.8%).\n\n Diarrhea was uncommon (3.8%).\n\n The median incubation period was 4 days (interquartile range, 2 to 7).\n\n On admission, ground-glass opacity was the most common radiologic finding on chest computed tomography (CT) (56.4%).\n\n No radiographic or CT abnormality was found in 157 of 877 patients (17.9%) with nonsevere disease and in 5 of 173 patients (2.9%) with severe disease.\n\n Lymphocytopenia was present in 83.2% of the patients on admission.\n\n\nConclusions\nDuring the first 2 months of the current outbreak, Covid-19 spread rapidly throughout China and caused varying degrees of illness.\n\n Patients often presented without fever, and many did not have abnormal radiologic findings.\n\n (Funded by the National Health Commission of China and

SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia in Wuhan, China: a single-centered, retrospective, observational study","abstract":"Background\nAn ongoing outbreak of pneumonia associated with the severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) started in December, 2019, in Wuhan, China.\n\n Information about critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection is scarce.\n\n We aimed to describe the clinical course and outcomes of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this single-centered, retrospective, observational study, we enrolled 52 critically ill adult patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia who were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) of Wuhan Jin Yin-tan hospital (Wuhan, China) between late December, 2019, and Jan 26, 2020. Demographic data, symptoms, laboratory values, comorbidities, treatments, and clinical outcomes were all collected.\n\n Data were compared between survivors and non-survivors.\n\n The primary outcome was 28-day mortality, as of Feb 9, 2020. Secondary outcomes included incidence of SARS-CoV-2-related acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and the proportion of patients requiring mechanical ventilation.\n\n\nFindings\nOf 710 patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, 52 critically ill adult patients were included.\n\n The mean age of the 52 patients was 59·7 (SD 13·3) years, 35 (67%) were men, 21 (40%) had chronic illness, 51 (98%) had fever.\n\n 32 (61·5%) patients had died at 28 days, and the median duration from admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) to death was 7 (IQR 3–11) days for non-survivors.\n\n Compared with survivors, non-survivors were older (64·6 years [11·2] vs 51·9 years [12·9]), more likely to develop ARDS (26 [81%] patients vs 9 [45%] patients), and more likely to receive mechanical ventilation (30 [94%] patients vs 7 [35%] patients), either invasively or non-invasively.\n\n Most patients had organ function damage, including 35 (67%) with ARDS, 15 (29%) with acute kidney injury, 12 (23%) with cardiac injury, 15 (29%) with liver dysfunction, and one (2%) with pneumothorax.\n\n 37 (71%) patients required mechanical ventilation.\n\n Hospital-acquired infection occurred in seven (13·5%) patients.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe mortality of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia is considerable.\n\n The survival time of the non-survivors is likely to be within 1–2 weeks after ICU admission.\n\n Older patients (&gt;65 years) with comorbidities and ARDS are at increased risk of death.\n\n The severity of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia poses great strain on critical care resources in hospitals, especially if they are not adequately staffed or resourced.\n\n\nFunding\nNone.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7102538","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Elsevier

changes in the micro-circulation are present in diabetes mellitus irrespective of the organ studied, and the pathogenesis is complex.\n Endothelial dysfunction, characterized by an imbalance between endothelium-derived vasodilator and vasoconstrictor substances, plays an important role in the pathogenesis of diabetic microangiopathy.\n Increased circulating levels of endothelin-1 (ET-1), a potent vasoconstrictor peptide, has been found in patients with diabetes, and a positive correlation between plasma ET-1 levels and microangiopathy in patients with type 2 diabetes has been demonstrated.\n In addition to its direct vasoconstrictor effects, enhanced levels of ET-1 may contribute to endothelial dysfunction through inhibitory effects on nitric oxide (NO) production.\n Vascular endothelial dysfunction may precede insulin resistance, although the feature of insulin resistance syndrome includes factors that have negative effects on endothelial function.\n Furthermore, ET-1 induces a reduction in insulin sensitivity and may take part in the development of the metabolic syndrome.\n In the following, the mechanisms by which ET-1 contributes to the development of diabetic microangiopathy and the potentially beneficial effect of selective ETA receptor antagonists are discussed.\n","id":"PMC2605330","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Dove Medical

with atherosclerosis.\n Aortic wall samples were obtained from patients with (N = 53) and without (N = 27) atherosclerosis undergoing cardiovascular surgery.\n Vascular smooth muscle cell cultures were generated, and expression of microRNA?145 (miR?145), its target gene Kruppel?Like Factor 5 (KLF5) and Myocardin (MYOCD, a smooth muscle?specific transcriptional coactivator) were analysed using RT?qPCR, along with expression of relevant proteins.\n Vascular smooth muscle cells were transduced with miR?145 inhibitor and mimic to determine the effect of miR?145 expression on VSMC proliferation.\n miR?145 expression decreased while KLF5 expression increased in atherosclerotic aortas.\n Atherosclerotic samples and VSMCs had decreased expression of contractile markers calponin

of ischaemic events and bleeding post-acute coronary syndromes (ACS).\n\n In the PLATelet inhibition and patient Outcomes (PLATO) trial, ticagrelor reduced the primary composite endpoint of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, or stroke, but with similar rates of major bleeding compared with clopidogrel.\n\n We aimed to investigate the outcome with ticagrelor vs.\n\n clopidogrel in patients with DM or poor glycaemic control.\n\n\nMethods and results\nWe analysed patients with pre-existing DM (n = 4662), including 1036 patients on insulin, those without DM (n = 13 951), and subgroups based on admission levels of haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c; n = 15 150).\n\n In patients with DM, the reduction in the primary composite endpoint (HR: 0.88, 95% CI: 0.76–1.03), all-cause mortality (HR: 0.82, 95% CI: 0.66–1.01), and stent thrombosis (HR: 0.65, 95% CI: 0.36–1.17) with no increase in major bleeding (HR: 0.95, 95% CI: 0.81–1.12) with ticagrelor was consistent with the overall cohort and without significant diabetes status-by-treatment interactions.\n\n There was no heterogeneity between patients with or without ongoing insulin treatment.\n\n Ticagrelor reduced the primary endpoint, all-cause mortality, and stent thrombosis in patients with HbA1c above the median (HR: 0.80, 95% CI: 0.70–0.91; HR: 0.78, 95% CI: 0.65–0.93; and HR: 0.62, 95% CI: 0.39–1.00, respectively) with similar bleeding rates (HR: 0.98, 95% CI: 0.86–1.12).\n\n\nConclusion\nTicagrelor, when compared with clopidogrel, reduced ischaemic events in ACS patients irrespective of diabetic status and glycaemic control, without an increase in major bleeding events.\n\n\n","id":"PMC3001588","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Oxford University

of cardiovascular risk","abstract":"An enhanced thrombotic environment and premature atherosclerosis are key factors for the increased cardiovascular risk in diabetes.\n The occlusive vascular thrombus, formed secondary to interactions between platelets and coagulation proteins, is composed of a skeleton of fibrin fibres with cellular elements embedded in this network.\n Diabetes is characterised by quantitative and qualitative changes in coagulation proteins, which collectively increase resistance to fibrinolysis, consequently augmenting thrombosis risk.\n Current long-term therapies to prevent arterial occlusion in diabetes are focussed on anti-platelet agents, a strategy that fails to address the contribution of coagulation proteins to the enhanced thrombotic milieu.\n Moreover, antiplatelet treatment is associated with bleeding complications, particularly with newer agents and more aggressive combination therapies, questioning the safety of this approach.\n Therefore, to safely control thrombosis risk in diabetes, an alternative approach is required with the fibrin network representing a credible therapeutic target.\n In the current review, we address diabetes-specific mechanistic pathways responsible for hypofibrinolysis including the role of clot structure, defects in the fibrinolytic system and increased incorporation of anti-fibrinolytic proteins into the clot.\n Future anti-thrombotic therapeutic options are discussed with special emphasis on the potential advantages of modulating incorporation of the anti-fibrinolytic proteins into fibrin networks.\n This latter approach carries theoretical advantages, including specificity for diabetes, ability to target a particular protein with a possible favourable risk of bleeding.\n The development of alternative treatment strategies to better control residual thrombosis risk in diabetes will help to reduce vascular events, which remain the main cause of mortality in this condition.\n","id":"PMC5345237","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"BioMed

properties - has been hypothesized to be involved in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis and plaque vulnerability.\n Lp-PLA2 activity has been demonstrated to be an independent predictor of coronary heart disease (CHD) and ischemic stroke.\n However, it has been recently reported that carriers of loss of function variants in PLA2G7 gene (encoding Lp-PLA2) had no lower CHD risk than non-carriers.\n The Stabilization of Atherosclerotic Plaque by Initiation of Darapladib Therapy (STABILITY), and the Stabilization of Plaque Using Darapladib - Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction 52 (SOLID-TIMI 52) studies are two phase III, randomized, placebo-controlled, clinical trials that were conducted to evaluate the clinical efficacy and safety of the Lp-PLA2 inhibitor (darapladib), against a background of optimal medical therapy, in patients with stable CHD and acute coronary syndrome, respectively.\n In both studies, darapladib failed to reduce the risk of major coronary events as compared to placebo.\n In addition, darapladib was associated with significantly higher rates of drug discontinuation, and adverse side effects such as diahrrea and malodorous feces, urine, and skin, as compared to placebo.\n These data suggest that Lp-PLA2 may be a biomarker of vascular inflammation rather than a causal pathway of cardiovascular (CV) diseases.\n It also challenges the notion that inhibition of Lp-PLA2 is a worthwhile approach in patients with CHD.\n Alternate therapies that target inflammation are awaited to reduce residual risk in patients with CV

achievements of EU-ROS as well as research updates and new perspectives arising from its members.\n The EU-ROS consortium comprised more than 140 active members who worked together for four years on the topics briefly described below.\n The formation of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (RONS) is an established hallmark of our aerobic environment and metabolism but RONS also act as messengers via redox regulation of essential cellular processes.\n The fact that many diseases have been found to be associated with oxidative stress established the theory of oxidative stress as a trigger of diseases that can be corrected by antioxidant therapy.\n However, while experimental studies support this thesis, clinical studies still generate controversial results, due to complex pathophysiology of oxidative stress in humans.\n For future improvement of antioxidant therapy and better understanding of redox-associated disease progression detailed knowledge on the sources and targets of RONS formation and discrimination of their detrimental or beneficial roles is required.\n In order to advance this important area of biology and medicine, highly synergistic approaches combining a variety

crossover trial (AGENT)","abstract":"Background\nHypertension is associated with impaired glucose tolerance and insulin resistance.\n\n Medical treatment that interferes with various steps in the renin-angiotensin system improves glucose tolerance and insulin resistance.\n\n However, it remains unclear if long-acting calcium channel blockers (CCBs) such as azelnidipine and amlodipine affect glucose tolerance and insulin resistance in clinical practice.\n\n\nMethods\nSeventeen non-diabetic patients with essential hypertension who had controlled blood pressure levels using amlodipine (5 mg/day) were enrolled in this study.\n\n After randomization, either azelnidipine (16 mg/day) or amlodipine (5 mg/day) was administered in a crossover design for 12-weeks.\n\n At baseline and the end of each CCB therapy, samples of blood and urine were collected and 75 g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) was performed.\n\n In addition, hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs) were measured at each point by flow cytometry and endothelial functions were measured by fingertip pulse amplitude tonometry using EndoPAT.\n\n\nResults\nAlthough blood pressure levels were identical after each CCB treatment, the heart rate significantly decreased after azelnidipine administration than that after amlodipine administration (P &lt; 0.005).\n\n Compared with amlodipine administration, azelnidipine significantly decreased levels of glucose and insulin 120 min after the 75 g OGTT (both P &lt; 0.05).\n\n Serum levels of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (P = 0.067) and interleukin-6 (P = 0.035) were decreased.\n\n Although endothelial functions were not different between the two medication groups, the number of circulating HPCs was significantly increased after azelnidipine administration (P = 0.016).\n\n\nConclusions\nThese results suggest that azelnidipine treatment may have beneficial effects on glucose tolerance, insulin sensitivity, the inflammatory state, and number of circulating progenitor cells in non-diabetic patients with essential hypertension.\n\n\n","id":"PMC3179711","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"BioMed

abnormalities, e.\ng.\n, heart disease and atherosclerosis, and microvascular abnormalities, e.\ng.\n, retinopathy, nephropathy and neuropathy, in particular diabetic foot ulceration.\n The highly conserved endogenous small non-coding RNA molecules, the micro RNAs (miRNAs) have in recent years been found to be involved in a number of biological processes, including the pathogenesis of disease.\n Their main function is to regulate post-transcriptional gene expression by binding to their target messenger RNAs (mRNAs), leading to mRNA degradation, suppression of translation or even gene activation.\n These molecules are promising therapeutic targets and demonstrate great potential as diagnostic biomarkers for disease.\n This review aims to describe the most recent findings

observational study of patient characteristics and mortality following hypoglycemia in the community","abstract":"Objectives\nCharacterize patients with diabetes with severe hypoglycemia requiring emergency services intervention at home and investigate 12-month mortality.\n\n\nResearch design and methods\nEmergency services call-outs for hypoglycemia were recorded between 2005 and 2013 in an area covering 34?000 patients with diabetes.\n\n Patient characteristics were documented together with capillary blood glucose (CBG), glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), and treatment for hypoglycemia; 12-month mortality and variables influencing survival were analyzed.\n\n\nResults\nIn 1835 episodes among 1156 patients, 45% had type 1 diabetes (68.2% males) and 44% had type 2 diabetes (49.4% males), with a minority unclassified.\n\n CBG at presentation (mean±SD) was 1.76±0.72?mmol/L in patients with type 1 diabetes and 1.96±0.68?mmol/L in patients with type 2 diabetes (p&lt;0.0001), with a higher HbA1c in the former group (8.3±1.52% (67.5±16.4?mmol/mol) and 7.8±1.74% (61.6±19.0?mmol/mol), respectively; p&lt;0.0001).\n\n A third of patients with type 2 diabetes were not on insulin therapy and displayed lower HbA1c compared with insulin users.\n\n Glucagon was used in 37% of patients with type 1 diabetes and 28% of patients with type 2 diabetes (p&lt;0.0001).\n\n One-year mortality was 4.45% in type 1 diabetes and 22.1% in type 2 diabetes.\n\n Age and type of diabetes were predictive of mortality in multivariable analysis, whereas CBG levels/frequency of hypoglycemia had no effect.\n\n\nConclusions\nSevere hypoglycemia in the community is common with a male predominance in type 1 diabetes.\n\n Severe hypoglycemia in non-insulin treated patients with type 2 diabetes is associated with lower HbA1c compared with insulin users.\n\n Severe hypoglycemia appears to be associated with increased mortality at 12?months, particularly in type 2 diabetes.\n\n\n","id":"PMC4486683","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"BMJ Publishing Group","authors":[{"firstname":"Francesca

in patients with type 2 diabetes (DM2) and established atherosclerosis.\n\n\nPurpose\nTo investigate the effect of daily treatment with a higher dose (2 g) of n-3 PUFAs on platelet function, coagulation parameters, fibrin clot properties, markers of systemic inflammation and metabolic status, in patients with atherosclerotic vascular disease and DM2 who receive optimal medical therapy.\n\n\nMethods\nWe conducted a prospective, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, double-center study, in which thrombin generation (plasma thrombogenic potential from automated thrombogram), fibrin clot properties (plasma fibrin clot permeability; lysis time), platelet aggregation (light transmission aggregometry with adenosine diphosphate and arachidonic acid used as agonists), HbA1c, insulin level, lipid profiles, leptin and adiponectin levels, as well as markers of systemic inflammation (i.\n\ne.\n\n, hsCRP, IL-6, TNF-?, ICAM-1, VCAM-1, and myeloperoxidase) were determined at baseline and at 3 months after treatment with 2 g/day of n-3 PUFAs (n = 36) or placebo (n = 38).\n\n Moreover, we assessed serum fatty acids of the phospholipid fraction by gas chromatography both at baseline and at the end of the study.\n\n\nResults\nMajority of patients were treated with optimal medical therapy and achieved recommended treatment targets.\n\n Despite higher serum levels of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) (by 204%; p &lt; 0.001) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) (by 62%; p &lt; 0.0001) in n-3 PUFA group at the end of treatment no changes in platelet aggregation, thrombin generation, fibrin clot properties or markers of systemic inflammation were observed.\n\n No intergroup differences in the insulin, HbA1c and lipid levels were found at the end of the study.\n\n There was no change in adiponectin and leptin in interventional group, however leptin increased in control group (p = 0.01), therefore after study period leptin levels were lower in the interventional group (p = 0.01).\n\n Additionally, resolvin D1 did not differ between interventional and control group.\n\n\nConclusions\nIn conclusion, our study demonstrated that in patients with long-standing, well-controlled DM2 and atherosclerotic disease the treatment with a high dose of n-3 PUFAs (namely, 1 g/day of EPA and 1 g/day of DHA for 3 months) does not improve coagulation, metabolic, and inflammatory status when measured with the specified tests.\n\n\nElectronic supplementary material\nThe online version of this article (doi:10.1186/s12933-017-0523-9) contains

Article screening, quality accessing and data extracting was independently undertaken by two reviewers.\n\n A meta-analysis was performed to clarify the efficacy and safety of ticagrelor in general ACS patients, and a meta-regression analysis was taken to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of ticagrelor in DM patients compared with general ACS patients.\n\n\nResult\nTwenty-two studies with 35004 participants were included.\n\n The meta-analysis result implicated that ticagrelor could: 1) reduce the incidence of the composite endpoint [OR = 0.83, 95%CI (0.77, 0.90), P&lt;0.00001] and the incidence of myocardial infarction [OR = 0.81, 95%CI (0.74, 0.89), P = 0.0001]; 2) not statistically reduce the incidence of cardiovascular death, the incidence of stroke and the incidence of bleeding events; 3) increase the incidence of dyspnea [OR = 1.90, 95%CI (1.73, 2.08), P&lt;0.00001] compared with clopidogrel.\n\n Meanwhile, compared with prasugrel, ticagrelor could 1) reduce the platelet reactivity of patients at maintenance dose [MD = -44.59, 95%CI (-59.16, -30.02), P&lt;0.00001]; 2) not statistically reduce the incidence of cardiovascular death, the platelet reactivity of patients 6 hours or 8 hours after administration, or the incidence of bleeding events; 3) induce the incidence of dyspnea [OR = 13.99, 95%CI (2.58, 75.92), P = 0.002].\n\n Furthermore, the result of meta-regression analysis implicated that there was a positive correlation between DM patients and the platelet reactivity of patients 6 hours and 8 hours after administration, but there was no obvious correlation between DM patients and general ACS patients in other endpoints.\n\n\nConclusion\nTicagrelor could reduce the incidence of composite endpoint of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction and stroke as well as platelet reactivity in DM patients with ACS, while not increasing the risk of bleeding.\n\n Because there are differences in platelet reactivity between DM patients and general ACS patients, we suggest that caution is needed when using ticagrelor in clinical applications.\n\n\n","id":"PMC5435320","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Public Library of Science","authors":[{"firstname":"Qiutong","surname":"Tan","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Xin","surname":"Jiang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Sichao","surname":"Huang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Tiantian","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Lin","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Siwen","surname":"Xie","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Enpan","surname":"Mo","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Jun","surname":"Xu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Shaohui","surname":"Cai","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Carmine","surname":"Pizzi","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Carmine","surname":"Pizzi","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1160/TH15-06-0467","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Effects of dabigatran on the cellular and protein phase of coagulation in patients with coronary artery disease on dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and clopidogrel.

Univariate and multivariate logistic regression was performed to investigate the relationship between each variable and the risk of death of COVID-19 pneumonia patients.\nIn total, 179 patients with COVID-19 pneumonia (97 male and 82 female) were included in the present prospective study, of whom 21 died. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that age &gt;=65 years (OR 3.765, 95% CI 1.146-17.394; p=0.023), pre-existing concurrent cardiovascular or cerebrovascular diseases (OR 2.464, 95% CI 0.755-8.044; p=0.007), CD3+CD8+ T-cells &lt;=75 cells muL-1 (OR 3.982, 95% CI 1.132-14.006; p&lt;0.001) and cardiac troponin I &gt;=0.05 ng mL-1 (OR 4.077, 95% CI 1.166-14.253; p&lt;0.001) were associated with an increase in risk of mortality from COVID-19 pneumonia.

The latter two factors, especially, were predictors for mortality of COVID-19 pneumonia patients.\nThese data showed that age &gt;=65 years, pre-existing concurrent cardiovascular or cerebrovascular diseases, CD3+CD8+ T-cells &lt;=75 cells muL-1 and cardiac troponin I &gt;=0.05 ng mL-1 were four risk factors predicting high mortality of COVID-19 pneumonia patients https://bit.ly/2Rh6Nqv\nIntroduction\nIn December 2019, a new contagious disease, named COVID-19 pneumonia and caused by a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), emerged in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China, and is now spreading across international borders. By 12 February 2020, 189 medical teams consisting of 21 569 doctors and nurses from 29 provinces of China had been sent to Hubei Province to deal with COVID-19 pneumonia. The ongoing COVID-19 pneumonia pandemic is currently not under control, with a high risk of spread in China and globally. As of 22 March 2020, a total of 307 297 confirmed cases had been reported in at least 169 countries. Unfortunately, the effect of the outbreak of COVID-19 pneumonia and the ultimate scope are unclear, as the situation is rapidly evolving. As a matter of fact, the fear of the ongoing COVID-19 epidemic was and is playing a major role in the economic and social consequences.\nIn the first published cohort of 41 patients with COVID-19 pneumonia from Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital, six (14.6%) patients worsened in a short period of time and died of multiple organ failure; when the cohort size expanded to 99 cases, 11 (11.1%) patients died. In another Wuhan cohort of hospitalised patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, the overall mortality was 4.3% (six out of 138). The findings from these three previous studies suggested that older age and underlying comorbidities were associated with disease severity or death of COVID-19 pneumonia patients. Between 25 December 2019 and 7 February 2020, a total of 179 adult patients with COVID-19 pneumonia were hospitalised to Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital, a special hospital for isolating and treating patients with infectious diseases. As of 24 March 2020, 158 patients had been discharged and the remaining 21 had died. In the present study, we sought to identify the clinical and laboratory parameters associated with mortality of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia.\nMethods\nPatients\nThis study was conducted in accordance with the approved guidelines of the Institutional Review Board of Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital (wufeilunli-2020-02). The need for written informed consent from each patient was waived since we prospectively collected and analysed all data from each patient according to the policy for public health outbreak investigation of emerging infectious diseases issued by the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China.\nBetween 25 December 2019 and 7 February 2020, a single-centre case cohort of 179 consecutive patients with confirmed and probable COVID-19 pneumonia was hospitalised to Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital; these patients were all included in the present study. The probable and definite diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia was established according to the case definition established by World Health Organization interim guidance.\nData collection and analysis\nThe information for all patients, including demographic data, clinical characteristics, laboratory parameters and outcomes, were collected prospectively. Two researchers independently reviewed the data collection forms to double-check the collected data.\nDescriptive statistics included frequency analysis (percentages) for categorical variables and mean+-sd or median and interquartile range for continuous variables. Comparisons were determined by t-test or Mann-Whitney U-test for continuous variables, as appropriate, and by the use of the Chi-squared test or Fisher exact test for categorical variables. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression was performed to explore the association of clinical characteristics and laboratory parameters and the risk of death. The backward conditional method was used to select imaging variables entering the scoring system. The statistical significance level was set at 0.05 (two-tailed). All analyses were conducted with MedCalc (MedCalc Software Ltd, Ostend, Belgium) and SPSS version 23.0 (IBM, Armonk, NY, USA) statistical software.\nResults\nClinical data\nThis report describes a COVID-19 pneumonia cohort of 179 patients who were hospitalised to Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital between 25 December 2019 and 7 February 2020, of whom 136 (76%) were diagnosed definitely as having COVID-19 pneumonia with a positive SARS-CoV-2 test result; the remaining 43 (24%) were diagnosed clinically. The mean+-sd time between onset of symptoms and hospitalisation was 9.7+-4.3 days. The mean+-sd age was 57.6+-13.7 years (range 18-87 years), and 97 (54.2%) were men (table 1). Of 179 patients, 21 (11.7%) worsened in a short period of time and died of multiple organ failure, especially respiratory failure and heart failure, and the mean+-sd duration from admission to death was 13.7+-8.3 days (range 3-33 days) (supplementary table S1).\nDemographics and clinical presentation in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia\nCharacteristics	Total	Deceased	Survivors	p-value	 	Patients	179	21	158		 	Age years	57.6+-13.7	70.2+-7.7	56.0+-13.5	&lt;0.001	 	Sex				0.642	 	 Male	97 (54.2)	10 (47.6)	87 (55.1)		 	 Female	82 (45.8)	11 (52.4)	71 (44.9)		 	Underlying diseases					 	 Hypertension	58 (32.4)	13 (61.9)	45 (28.5)	0.005	 	 Cardiovascular or cerebrovascular diseases	29 (16.2)	12 (57.1)	17 (10.8)	&lt;0.001	 	 Diabetes	33 (18.4)	6 (28.6)	27 (17.1)	0.231	 	 Chronic digestive disorders	21 (11.7)	4 (19.0)	17 (10.8)	0.279	 	 Tuberculosis	8 (4.5)	0 (0)	8 (5.1)	0.599	 	 Chronic hepatic or renal insufficiency	4 (2.2)	2 (9.5)	2 (1.3)	0.068	 	 Peripheral vascular disease	4 (2.2)	2 (9.5)	2 (1.3)	0.068	 	 Malignancy	4 (2.2)	1 (4.8)	3 (1.9)	0.396	 	Symptoms					 	 Fever	177 (98.9)	21 (100)	156 (98.7)	1.000	 	 Dry cough	146 (81.6)	14 (66.7)	132 (83.5)	0.074	 	 Dyspnoea	89 (49.7)	18 (85.7)	71 (44.9)	&lt;0.001	 	 Fatigue	71 (39.7)	13 (61.9)	58 (36.7)	0.033	 	 Sputum production	55 (30.7)	12 (57.1)	43 (27.2)	0.010	 	 Gastrointestinal symptoms	39 (21.8)	8 (38.1)	31 (19.6)	0.087	 	 Myalgia	34 (19.0)	7 (33.3)	27 (17.1)	0.083	 	 Headache	17 (9.5)	5 (23.8)	12 (7.6)	0.033	 	 Haemoptysis	10 (5.6)	0 (0)	10 (6.3)	0.609	 	Systolic blood pressure mmHg		NA	122.4+-18.6		 	Diastolic blood pressure mmHg		NA	77.9+-10.0		 	Temperature  C				0.156	 	 &lt;37.3	109 (60.9)	16 (76.2)	93 (58.9)		 	 &gt;=37.3	70 (39.1)	5 (23.8)	65 (41.1)		 	Respiratory rate breaths min-1	20.0 (20.0-21.0)	20.0 (20.0-34.5)	20.0 (20.0-21.0)	0.016	 	Heart rate beats min-1	86.0 (78.0-100)	94.0 (78.0-109.5)	85.5 (78.0-99.3)	0.150	 	\nData are presented as n, mean+-sd, n (%) or median (interquartile range), unless otherwise stated. NA: not available.\nAs shown in table 1, the patients in the deceased group were much older than those in the survivor group (70.2+-7.7 years versus 56.0+-13.5 years; p&lt;0.001). We noted that more patients in the deceased group had hypertension (61.9% versus 28.5%; p=0.005) and cardiovascular or cerebrovascular diseases (57.1% versus 10.8%; p&lt;0.001), and that there was no difference in the incidence of diabetes, chronic digestive disorders, tuberculosis, chronic hepatic or renal insufficiency, peripheral vascular disease or malignancy between the two groups (all p&gt;0.05).\nVery similarly to the findings reported in the previous studies, we noted that the top five common symptoms included fever (98.9% of the patients), dry cough (81.6%), dyspnoea (49.7%), fatigue (39.7%) and sputum production (30.7%) on admission among the total population (table 1). Except for dyspnoea, fatigue, sputum production and headache, which were more frequently present in the deceased group than in the survivor group (85.7% versus 44.9% (p&lt;0.001), 61.9% versus 36.7% (p=0.033), 57.1% versus 27.2% (p=0.010) and 23.8% versus 7.6% (p=0.033), respectively), other kinds of symptoms were similar in the two groups. Patients in the deceased group had a higher respiratory rate than those in the survivor group (p=0.016); there was no difference in heart rate.\nLaboratory findings\nPotentially due to the presence of secondary bacterial infection, as suggested by higher concentrations of C-reactive protein and procalcitonin, the deceased had more white blood cells and neutrophils than did the survivors (table 2). In fact, lung secondary bacterial infections were documented at a late stage of disease in 10 of the 21 deceased patients, and the aetiological spectrum included Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus, Acinetobacter baumannii and Escherichia coli. As expected, the deceased had reduced lymphocytes compared to the survivors. One remarkable finding was that absolute numbers of CD3+CD8+ T-cells, but not CD3+CD4+ T-cells, were significantly reduced in the deceased compared to the survivors.\nLaboratory findings in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia\nCharacteristics	Total	Deceased	Survivors	p-value	 	Patients	179	21	158		 	White blood cells x109 cells L-1	5.3 (3.9-7.8)	8.9 (4.8-13.1)	5.1 (3.8-7.3)	0.003	 	Neutrophils x109 cells L-1	4.0 (2.7-6.6)	7.7 (3.0-11.5)	3.9 (2.6-6.1)	0.007	 	Lymphocytes x109 cells L-1	0.8 (0.6-1.1)	0.7 (0.5-0.8)	0.8 (0.6-1.1)	0.046	 	T-cell subsets					 	 CD3+CD4+ cells muL-1	114.3 (62.9-195.3)	68.0 (55.1-148.8)	128.3 (73.5-201.7)	0.066	 	 CD3+CD8+ cells muL-1	75.5 (45.5-125.0)	47.9 (25.4-73.8)	104.5 (58.5-142.7)	0.001	 	C-reactive protein mg L-1	39.8 (20.6-97.8)	86.4 (37.9-105.5)	36.0 (19.3-91.0)	0.012	 	Procalcitonin ng mL-1	0.1 (0.0-0.2)	0.1 (0.1-0.5)	0.1 (0.0-0.2)	0.013	 	Cardiac troponin I ng mL-1	0.0 (0.0-0.1)	0.1 (0.0-0.8)	0.0 (0.0-0.0)	&lt;0.001	 	Myoglobin ng mL-1	36.9 (18.4-124.0)	162.0 (48.5-342.8)	32.3 (15.5-60.3)	&lt;0.001	 	Brain natriuretic peptide pg mL-1	645.0 (110.0-1504.0)	970.0 (620.5-3531.0)	390.0 (58.0-1118.5)	0.004	 	Albumin g L-1	33.2 (30.7-36.4)	33.2 (31.2-35.6)	33.0 (30.6-38.1)	0.764	 	Total bilirubin mumol L-1	8.9 (6.6-12.5)	9.6 (8.3-16.3)	8.7 (6.5-12.3)	0.146	 	Direct bilirubin mumol L-1	2.5 (1.8-3.9)	3.1 (2.3-6.1)	2.4 (1.8-3.8)	0.101	 	Alanine aminotransferase U L-1	22.0 (15.0-40.0)	27.0 (20.0-37.0)	22.0 (14.0-40.5)	0.233	 	Aspartate aminotransferase U L-1	30.0 (19.0-43.0)	40.0 (27.0-61.5)	27.5 (19.0-42.0)	0.010	 	gamma-Glutamyltranspeptidase U L-1	29.0 (17.0-52.5)	23.0 (16.5-42.0)	29.0 (17.0-54.5)	0.518	 	Creatinine mumol L-1	66.5 (55.8-82.0)	95.0 (63.0-112.0)	65.0 (55.0-80.0)	0.001	 	D-dimer mg L-1	0.5 (0.3-1.7)	1.1 (0.4-10.5)	0.5 (0.3-1.2)	0.011	 	Prothrombin time s	13.7 (12.4-15.4)	13.9 (12.3-16.3)	13.7 (12.4-15.2)	0.758	 	Activated partial thromboplastin time s	35.6 (31.0-39.4)	37.8 (30.8-41.5)	35.3 (30.9-39.1)	0.383	 	PaO2mmHg	72.0 (57.0- 88.0)	56.0 (49.0 -71.0)	74.5 (59.0-92.0)	0.001	 	PaCO2mmHg	37.0 (33.0- 41.0)	34.0 (29.0-41.0)	37.0 (34.0-41.0)	0.068	 	PaO2:FIO2mmHg	249.6+-106.1	185.5+-64.8	261.5+-108.2	0.002	 	\nData are presented as n, median (interquartile range) or mean+-sd, unless otherwise stated.

Our analysis revealed that age &gt;=65 years, hypertension, cardiovascular or cerebrovascular diseases, dyspnoea, fatigue, sputum production, headache, white blood cell count &gt;10x109 cells L-1, neutrophil count &gt;6.3x109 cells L-1, CD3+CD8+ T-cells &lt;=75 cells muL-1, cardiac troponin I &gt;=0.05 ng mL-1, myoglobin &gt;100 ng L-1, creatinine &gt;=133 mumol L-1, D-dimer &gt;=0.5 mg L-1 and PaO2 &lt;60 mmHg were associated with the death of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia (table 3). Of all the studied variables, PaO2 &gt;=80 mmHg was the only factor that was associated with patients' survival (OR 0.233, 95% CI 0.065-0.840; p=0.026). The above 16 variables were further processed using a multivariable logistic regression model, which selected four variables that were predictive of mortality, including age &gt;=65 years, cardiovascular or cerebrovascular diseases, CD3+CD8+ T-cells &lt;=75 cells muL-1 and cardiac troponin I &gt;=0.05 ng mL-1 (table 4).\nMultivariate logistic regression analysis of mortality risk factors for patients with COVID-19 pneumonia\nVariables	OR (95% CI)	p-value	 	Age &gt;=65 years	3.765 (1.146-17.394)	0.023	 	Cardiovascular or cerebrovascular diseases	2.464 (0.755-8.044)	0.007	 	CD3+CD8+ T-cells &lt;=75 cells muL-1	3.982 (1.132-14.006)	&lt;0.001	 	Cardiac troponin I &gt;=0.05 ng mL-1	4.077 (1.166-14.253)	&lt;0.001	 	\nTo further understand the factors that can affect the survival of COVID-19 pneumonia patients with similar age and underlying diseases, we selected 42 sex-, age- and underlying disease-matched patients from the survivors to perform a case-control study at a ratio of 2:1. As shown in supplementary table S2, there was no difference in any of the demographic and clinical presentation parameters between the deceased and the matched case-control survivors. Given that many survivors were younger people, two survivors whose age was the same or +-1 year were matched to each one deceased. Compared to the survivors, the deceased had significantly increased concentrations of procalcitonin, cardiac troponin I, myoglobin and creatinine, and significantly reduced numbers of CD3+CD8+ T-cells (supplementary table S3). After excluding the impact of age and underlying diseases on mortality, univariate analysis indicated that CD3+CD8+ T-cells &lt;=75 cells muL-1 and cardiac troponin I &gt;=0.05 ng mL-1 were the only two variables that could be predictors of mortality of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia (table 5).\nUnivariate analysis of mortality risk factors for patients with COVID-19 pneumonia in matched case-control study\nVariables	Deceased	Survivors	OR (95% CI)	p-value	 	Patients n	21	42			 	CD3+CD8+ T-cells &lt;=75 cells muL-1	78.9	42.9	5.000 (1.319-18.960)	0.018	 	Cardiac troponin I &gt;=0.05 ng mL-1	61.5	18.2	7.200 (1.518-34.139)	0.013	 	Myoglobin &gt;100 ng mL-1	60.0	28.6	3.750 (0.924-15.226)	0.064	 	Procalcitonin &gt;=0.5 ng mL-1	21.1	9.1	2.667 (0.528-13.477)	0.235	 	Creatinine &gt;=133 mumol L-1	19.0	4.8	4.706 (0.786-28.178)	0.090	 	\nData are presented as %, unless otherwise stated.\nDiscussion\nThe ongoing SARS-CoV-2 epidemic is the third time that a zoonotic coronavirus has crossed species to infect human populations during the past 18 years. In November 2002, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), caused by SARS-CoV, was first found in Guangdong Province, China, and the number of SARS cases increased substantially in the next year in China and later spread globally, infecting 8098 people in 26 countries and killing 774 of them. Between September 2012 and 20 January 2017, the outbreak of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), caused by MERS-CoV, led to 1879 laboratory-confirmed cases in 27 countries, resulting in at least 659 related deaths. As of midnight on 24 March 2020, the numbers of Chinese confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia cases and deaths were 81 218 and 3281, respectively, indicating that the overall death rate from COVID-19 pneumonia was 4%.\nIn Wuhan City, two large-scale special hospitals, Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital and Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital, provide medical service for patients with infectious diseases. Since the outbreak of COVID-19 pneumonia, all patients in the two hospitals have been COVID-19 pneumonia cases. Usually, only those patients with severe disease from general hospitals are transferred to the special hospitals for quarantine and treatment. This was why the overall mortality of COVID-19 pneumonia in the special hospitals (11.1% in the cohort of Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital and 11.7% (95% CI 7.0-16.5%) in our current cohort) seemed to be higher than that in the cohort of a general hospital (4.3%). Unfortunately, no anti-SARS-CoV-2 drugs are available for treating patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. Although no antibiotic, antifungal drug, corticosteroid or immune globulin is routinely recommended to be administered for COVID-19 pneumonia, a combination consisting of two or more of these drugs was given to all critically ill patients in the present study.\nIt has been documented that, although there are some similarities in the clinical features between SARS and MERS, MERS progresses to respiratory failure much more rapidly with much higher mortality than SARS, and older age and underlying illness is likely to be related to the mortality of MERS. In the present study, patients in the deceased group were much older than the survivors, and univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed age &gt;=65 years as a strong predictor for death from COVID-19 pneumonia. In fact, in the whole cohort of 179 COVID-19 pneumonia patients, no one died who was younger than 50 years whereas 17 (81%) of the deceased patients were older than 65 years. As expected, our analysis also revealed that underlying cardiovascular or cerebrovascular diseases contributed to high mortality from COVID-19 pneumonia.\nIt has been demonstrated that inactivated SARS-CoV elicits an antigen-specific recall cytotoxic T-lymphocyte response in peripheral blood mononuclear cells of recovered SARS patients, but not in patients with critical SARS or those who have died of SARS, suggesting that the latter apparently cannot generate sufficient protective immunity to eliminate SARS-CoV; their immune responses to this pathogen may have in fact exacerbated their illness. In the case of MERS, several inflammatory mediators, including inducible protein-10, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 and interleukin-6, are strongly associated with mortality. Given that COVID-19 pneumonia is an emerging infectious disease, the mechanisms by which SARS-CoV-2 causes severe illness and fatal outcomes in humans are unknown. More recently, CD8+ T-cells have been reported to be significantly decreased in peripheral blood in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. It has been shown for several cytokines and chemokines, such as interleukin-2, interleukin-7, interleukin-10, macrophage colony-stimulating factor, inducible protein-10, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, macrophage inflammatory protein-1alpha and tumour necrosis factor-alpha, that concentrations were higher in patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia than in those with mild disease, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 infection damages the human immune system and results in a systematic inflammatory response. One important finding in our study was that CD3+CD8+ T-cells, but not CD3+CD4+ T-cells, were tremendously reduced in the circulation in deceased patients compared to either the total survivor population or the sex-, age- and comorbid illness-matched controls. More importantly, CD3+CD8+ T-cells &lt;=75 cells muL-1 was a reliable predictor for mortality of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. These data indicate that progressive immune-associated injury and inadequate adaptive immune responses could be possible mechanisms by which SARS-CoV-2 causes severe illness and fatal outcomes.\nOn 24 March 2020, China had 4287 current cases with confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia, and 1399 (32.6%) of them were very severe cases. As mentioned, the overall death rate from COVID-19 pneumonia was 4%, and most deceased patients were older people with underlying illness. For a younger cohort of 1716 Chinese medical staff whose age was always &lt;65 years all over the country, six (0.3%) died. These data suggest that the majority of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia will recover from the disease, especially younger people. Our current data demonstrate that patients in the deceased group were susceptible to multiple organ failure, especially heart failure and respiratory failure. One of the best laboratory parameters reflecting heart injury for predicting mortality from COVID-19 pneumonia was cardiac troponin I, and this parameter remained valid in the sex-, age- and underlying illness-matched control analysis. Our findings suggest that, in the care of critically ill patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, a strategy for protection of vital organs should be emphasised to improve their survival. It should be noted that the elevation of cardiac troponin I in COVID-19 patients was indicative of myocardial injury that was probably secondary to severe hypoxaemia. For the patients with positive cardiac troponin I results, what we could do was to choose an appropriate respiratory support strategy to improve oxygenation and wait for the recovery of the myocardial damage.\nIn conclusion, we identified four predictors for high mortality among the overall population of COVID-19 pneumonia patients: age &gt;=65 years, pre-existing concurrent cardiovascular or cerebrovascular diseases, CD3+CD8+ T-cells &lt;=75 cells muL-1 and cardiac troponin I &gt;=0.05 ng mL-1. In the sex-, age- and comorbid illness-matched case-control study, we further found that CD3+CD8+ T-cells &lt;=75 cells muL-1 and cardiac troponin I &gt;=0.05 ng mL-1 remained as predictors for high mortality of COVID-19 pneumonia patients with similar age and underlying diseases.\nSupplementary material\nShareable PDF\nThis article has supplementary material available from erj.ersjournals.com\nAuthor contributions: Huan-Zhong Shi and Peng Peng conceived the idea, designed and supervised the study, had full access to all data and took responsibility for the integrity of the data.

Considerable efforts to reduce transmission will be required to control outbreaks if similar dynamics apply elsewhere.\n\n Measures to prevent or reduce transmission should be implemented in populations at risk.\n\n (Funded by the Ministry of Science and Technology of China and others.\n\n)\n","id":"PMC7121484","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Massachusetts Medical Society","authors":[{"firstname":"Qun","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xuhua","surname":"Guan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Peng","surname":"Wu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xiaoye","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lei","surname":"Zhou","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yeqing","surname":"Tong","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ruiqi","surname":"Ren","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Kathy S.M.","surname":"Leung","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Eric H.Y.","surname":"Lau","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jessica Y.","surname":"Wong","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xuesen","surname":"Xing","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Nijuan","surname":"Xiang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yang","surname":"Wu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Chao","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Qi","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Dan","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Tian","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jing","surname":"Zhao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Man","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Wenxiao","surname":"Tu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Chuding","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lianmei","surname":"Jin","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Rui","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Qi","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Suhua","surname":"Zhou","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Rui","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Hui","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yinbo","surname":"Luo","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yuan","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ge","surname":"Shao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Huan","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhongfa","surname":"Tao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yang","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhiqiang","surname":"Deng","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Boxi","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhitao","surname":"Ma","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yanping","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Guoqing","surname":"Shi","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Tommy T.Y.","surname":"Lam","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Joseph T.","surname":"Wu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"George F.","surname":"Gao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Benjamin J.","surname":"Cowling","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Bo","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Bo","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Gabriel M.","surname":"Leung","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zijian","surname":"Feng","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}],"References depth 2":[{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"The 2019-nCoV Outbreak Joint Field Epidemiology Investigation Team, Li Q.

Cases exported domestically were then estimated.\n\n We forecasted the national and global spread of 2019-nCoV, accounting for the effect of the metropolitan-wide quarantine of Wuhan and surrounding cities, which began Jan 23–24, 2020. We used data on monthly flight bookings from the Official Aviation Guide and data on human mobility across more than 300 prefecture-level cities in mainland China from the Tencent database.\n\n Data on confirmed cases were obtained from the reports published by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\n Serial interval estimates were based on previous studies of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV).\n\n A susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered metapopulation model was used to simulate the epidemics across all major cities in China.\n\n The basic reproductive number was estimated using Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods and presented using the resulting posterior mean and 95% credibile interval (CrI).\n\n\nFindings\nIn our baseline scenario, we estimated that the basic reproductive number for 2019-nCoV was 2·68 (95% CrI 2·47–2·86) and that 75?815 individuals (95% CrI 37?304–130?330) have been infected in Wuhan as of Jan 25, 2020. The epidemic doubling time was 6·4 days (95% CrI 5·8–7·1).\n\n We estimated that in the baseline scenario, Chongqing, Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Shenzhen had imported 461 (95% CrI 227–805), 113 (57–193), 98 (49–168), 111 (56–191), and 80 (40–139) infections from Wuhan, respectively.\n\n If the transmissibility of 2019-nCoV were similar everywhere domestically and over time, we inferred that epidemics are already growing exponentially in multiple major cities of China with a lag time behind the Wuhan outbreak of about 1–2 weeks.\n\n\nInterpretation\nGiven that 2019-nCoV is no longer contained within Wuhan, other major Chinese cities are probably sustaining localised outbreaks.\n\n Large cities overseas with close transport links to China could also become outbreak epicentres, unless substantial public health interventions at both the population and personal levels are implemented immediately.\n\n Independent self-sustaining outbreaks in major cities globally could become inevitable because of substantial exportation of presymptomatic cases and in the absence of large-scale public health interventions.\n\n Preparedness plans and mitigation interventions should be readied for quick deployment globally.\n\n\nFunding\nHealth and Medical Research Fund (Hong Kong, China).\n\n\n","id":"PMC7159271","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Elsevier

Serological Study for the Prevalence of Anti-MERS Coronavirus Antibodies in High- and Low-Risk Groups in Qatar","abstract":"Infection with Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) could be asymptomatic or cause mild influenza-like illness.\n Therefore, the prevalence of MERS-CoV infections in the general population could be underestimated, which necessitates active surveillance to determine the epidemiological importance of asymptomatic cases.\n The aim of this study is to evaluate the performance of various serological assays and to estimate the seroprevalence of anti-MERS-CoV antibodies in high- and low-risk groups in Qatar.\n A total of 4858 samples were screened, including 4719 samples collected from healthy blood donors (BD) over a period of five years (2012-2016), 135 samples from baseline case contacts (CC) collected from individuals in close contact with three positive PCR-confirmed patients (CP), and four samples from MERS-CoV CP.\n Initial screening using anti-MERS-CoV IgG (IgG rS1-ELISA kit) revealed ten reactive samples from BD (10/4719, 0.21%), one from CC (1/135, 0.74%), and three from CP (3/4, 75%).\n Samples from CP but not from BD were also reactive by whole-virus anti-MERS-CoV IgG (n = 3/4) and IgM (n = 1/4) indirect immunefluorescent tests (IIFT) and pseudoparticle neutralization test (ppNT).\n The reactive sample from CC was also confirmed by ppNT.\n Surprisingly, one out of thirteen (7.7%) randomly selected IgG rS1-ELISA-negative BD samples from the initial screening was reactive by the IgM-IIFT (but not by the IgG-IIFT) and was subsequently confirmed by ppNT.\n All IgG rS1-ELISA-reactive samples from BD exhibited considerable reactivity to the four circulating human coronaviruses (HKU1, OC43, 229E, and NL63).\n Cross-reactivity with SARS was only reported for samples from CP using IgG and IgM-IIFT.\n In conclusion, we report a low prevalence of anti-MERS antibodies in the general population, which coincides with the low number of all reported cases by the time of our study (2017) in Qatar (n = 21).\n The false-positive results and the observed cross-reactivity between MERS-CoV and other circulating human coronavirus necessitate more detailed evaluation of available serological assays.\n","id":"PMC6398027","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Hindawi","authors":[{"firstname":"Reham

(2019-nCoV).\n\n We report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatment and clinical outcomes of these patients.\n\n\nMethods\nAll patients with suspected 2019-nCoV were admitted to a designated hospital in Wuhan.\n\n We prospectively collected and analysed data on patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection by real-time RT-PCR and next-generation sequencing.\n\n Data were obtained with standardised data collection forms shared by WHO and the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium from electronic medical records.\n\n Researchers also directly communicated with patients or their families to ascertain epidemiological and symptom data.\n\n Outcomes were also compared between patients who had been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and those who had not.\n\n\nFindings\nBy Jan 2, 2020, 41 admitted hospital patients had been identified as having laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection.\n\n Most of the infected patients were men (30 [73%] of 41); less than half had underlying diseases (13 [32%]), including diabetes (eight [20%]), hypertension (six [15%]), and cardiovascular disease (six [15%]).\n\n Median age was 49·0 years (IQR 41·0–58·0).\n\n 27 (66%) of 41 patients had been exposed to Huanan seafood market.\n\n One family cluster was found.\n\n Common symptoms at onset of illness were fever (40 [98%] of 41 patients), cough (31 [76%]), and myalgia or fatigue (18 [44%]); less common symptoms were sputum production (11 [28%] of 39), headache (three [8%] of 38), haemoptysis (two [5%] of 39), and diarrhoea (one [3%] of 38).\n\n Dyspnoea developed in 22 (55%) of 40 patients (median time from illness onset to dyspnoea 8·0 days [IQR 5·0–13·0]).\n\n 26 (63%) of 41 patients had lymphopenia.\n\n All 41 patients had pneumonia with abnormal findings on chest CT.\n\n Complications included acute respiratory distress syndrome (12 [29%]), RNAaemia (six [15%]), acute cardiac injury (five [12%]) and secondary infection (four [10%]).\n\n 13 (32%) patients were admitted to an ICU and six (15%) died.\n\n Compared with non-ICU patients, ICU patients had higher plasma levels of IL2, IL7, IL10, GSCF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNF?.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe 2019-nCoV infection caused clusters of severe respiratory illness similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and was associated with ICU admission and high mortality.\n\n Major gaps in our knowledge of the origin, epidemiology, duration of human transmission, and clinical

associated with a novel coronavirus was reported in Wuhan city, Hubei province, China.\n\n Affected patients were geographically linked with a local wet market as a potential source.\n\n No data on person-to-person or nosocomial transmission have been published to date.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this study, we report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, radiological, and microbiological findings of five patients in a family cluster who presented with unexplained pneumonia after returning to Shenzhen, Guangdong province, China, after a visit to Wuhan, and an additional family member who did not travel to Wuhan.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of genetic sequences from these patients were done.\n\n\nFindings\nFrom Jan 10, 2020, we enrolled a family of six patients who travelled to Wuhan from Shenzhen between Dec 29, 2019 and Jan 4, 2020. Of six family members who travelled to Wuhan, five were identified as infected with the novel coronavirus.\n\n Additionally, one family member, who did not travel to Wuhan, became infected with the virus after several days of contact with four of the family members.\n\n None of the family members had contacts with Wuhan markets or animals, although two had visited a Wuhan hospital.\n\n Five family members (aged 36–66 years) presented with fever, upper or lower respiratory tract symptoms, or diarrhoea, or a combination of these 3–6 days after exposure.\n\n They presented to our hospital (The University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen) 6–10 days after symptom onset.\n\n They and one asymptomatic child (aged 10 years) had radiological ground-glass lung opacities.\n\n Older patients (aged &gt;60 years) had more systemic symptoms, extensive radiological ground-glass lung changes, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and increased C-reactive protein and lactate dehydrogenase levels.\n\n The nasopharyngeal or throat swabs of these six patients were negative for known respiratory microbes by point-of-care multiplex RT-PCR, but five patients (four adults and the child) were RT-PCR positive for genes encoding the internal RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and surface Spike protein of this novel coronavirus, which were confirmed by Sanger sequencing.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these five patients' RT-PCR amplicons and two full genomes by next-generation sequencing showed that this is a novel coronavirus, which is closest to the bat severe acute respiatory syndrome (SARS)-related coronaviruses found in Chinese horseshoe bats.\n\n\nInterpretation\nOur findings are consistent with person-to-person transmission of this novel coronavirus in hospital and family settings, and the reports of infected travellers in other geographical regions.\n\n\nFunding\nThe Shaw Foundation Hong Kong, Michael Seak-Kan Tong, Respiratory Viral Research Foundation Limited, Hui

outcomes in patients with a number of different malignancies.\n\n The objective of this study was to assess the relationship between NLR and mortality in a population of adult critically ill patients.\n\n\nMethods\nWe performed an observational cohort study of unselected intensive care unit (ICU) patients based on records in a large clinical database.\n\n We computed individual patient NLR and categorized patients by quartile of this ratio.\n\n The association of NLR quartiles and 28-day mortality was assessed using multivariable logistic regression.\n\n Secondary outcomes included mortality in the ICU, in-hospital mortality and 1-year mortality.\n\n An a priori subgroup analysis of patients with versus without sepsis was performed to assess any differences in the relationship between the NLR and outcomes in these cohorts.\n\n\nResults\nA total of 5,056 patients were included.\n\n Their 28-day mortality rate was 19%.\n\n The median age of the cohort was 65 years, and 47% were female.\n\n The median NLR for the entire cohort was 8.9 (interquartile range, 4.99 to 16.21).\n\n Following multivariable adjustments, there was a stepwise increase in mortality with increasing quartiles of NLR (first quartile: reference category; second quartile odds ratio (OR) = 1.32; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.03 to 1.71; third quartile OR = 1.43; 95% CI, 1.12 to 1.83; 4th quartile

coronavirus (2019-nCoV) emerged in Wuhan, China.\n\n We aimed to further clarify the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of 2019-nCoV pneumonia.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this retrospective, single-centre study, we included all confirmed cases of 2019-nCoV in Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital from Jan 1 to Jan 20, 2020. Cases were confirmed by real-time RT-PCR and were analysed for epidemiological, demographic, clinical, and radiological features and laboratory data.\n\n Outcomes were followed up until Jan 25, 2020.\nFindings\nOf the 99 patients with 2019-nCoV pneumonia, 49 (49%) had a history of exposure to the Huanan seafood market.\n\n The average age of the patients was 55·5 years (SD 13·1), including 67 men and 32 women.\n\n 2019-nCoV was detected in all patients by real-time RT-PCR.\n\n 50 (51%) patients had chronic diseases.\n\n Patients had clinical manifestations of fever (82 [83%] patients), cough (81 [82%] patients), shortness of breath (31 [31%] patients), muscle ache (11 [11%] patients), confusion (nine [9%] patients), headache (eight [8%] patients), sore throat (five [5%] patients), rhinorrhoea (four [4%] patients), chest pain (two [2%] patients), diarrhoea (two [2%] patients), and nausea and vomiting (one [1%] patient).\n\n According to imaging examination, 74 (75%) patients showed bilateral pneumonia, 14 (14%) patients showed multiple mottling and ground-glass opacity, and one (1%) patient had pneumothorax.\n\n 17 (17%) patients developed acute respiratory distress syndrome and, among them, 11 (11%) patients worsened in a short period of time and died of multiple organ failure.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe 2019-nCoV infection was of clustering onset, is more likely to affect older males with comorbidities, and can result in severe and even fatal respiratory diseases such as acute respiratory distress syndrome.\n\n In general, characteristics of patients who died were in line with the MuLBSTA score, an early warning model for predicting mortality in viral pneumonia.\n\n Further investigation is needed to explore the applicability of the MuLBSTA score in

the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatment and clinical outcomes of these patients.\n\n\nMethods\nAll patients with suspected 2019-nCoV were admitted to a designated hospital in Wuhan.\n\n We prospectively collected and analysed data on patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection by real-time RT-PCR and next-generation sequencing.\n\n Data were obtained with standardised data collection forms shared by WHO and the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium from electronic medical records.\n\n Researchers also directly communicated with patients or their families to ascertain epidemiological and symptom data.\n\n Outcomes were also compared between patients who had been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and those who had not.\n\n\nFindings\nBy Jan 2, 2020, 41 admitted hospital patients had been identified as having laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection.\n\n Most of the infected patients were men (30 [73%] of 41); less than half had underlying diseases (13 [32%]), including diabetes (eight [20%]), hypertension (six [15%]), and cardiovascular disease (six [15%]).\n\n Median age was 49·0 years (IQR 41·0–58·0).\n\n 27 (66%) of 41 patients had been exposed to Huanan seafood market.\n\n One family cluster was found.\n\n Common symptoms at onset of illness were fever (40 [98%] of 41 patients), cough (31 [76%]), and myalgia or fatigue (18 [44%]); less common symptoms were sputum production (11 [28%] of 39), headache (three [8%] of 38), haemoptysis (two [5%] of 39), and diarrhoea (one [3%] of 38).\n\n Dyspnoea developed in 22 (55%) of 40 patients (median time from illness onset to dyspnoea 8·0 days [IQR 5·0–13·0]).\n\n 26 (63%) of 41 patients had lymphopenia.\n\n All 41 patients had pneumonia with abnormal findings on chest CT.\n\n Complications included acute respiratory distress syndrome (12 [29%]), RNAaemia (six [15%]), acute cardiac injury (five [12%]) and secondary infection (four [10%]).\n\n 13 (32%) patients were admitted to an ICU and six (15%) died.\n\n Compared with non-ICU patients, ICU patients had higher plasma levels of IL2, IL7, IL10, GSCF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNF?.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe 2019-nCoV infection caused clusters of severe respiratory illness similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and was associated with ICU admission and high mortality.\n\n Major gaps in our knowledge of the origin, epidemiology, duration of human transmission, and clinical spectrum of disease need fulfilment by future

The primary composite end point was admission to an intensive care unit (ICU), the use of mechanical ventilation, or death.\n\n\nResults\nThe median age of the patients was 47 years; 41.9% of the patients were female.\n\n The primary composite end point occurred in 67 patients (6.1%), including 5.0% who were admitted to the ICU, 2.3% who underwent invasive mechanical ventilation, and 1.4% who died.\n\n Only 1.9% of the patients had a history of direct contact with wildlife.\n\n Among nonresidents of Wuhan, 72.3% had contact with residents of Wuhan, including 31.3% who had visited the city.\n\n The most common symptoms were fever (43.8% on admission and 88.7% during hospitalization) and cough (67.8%).\n\n Diarrhea was uncommon (3.8%).\n\n The median incubation period was 4 days (interquartile range, 2 to 7).\n\n On admission, ground-glass opacity was the most common radiologic finding on chest computed tomography (CT) (56.4%).\n\n No radiographic or CT abnormality was found in 157 of 877 patients (17.9%) with nonsevere disease and in 5 of 173 patients (2.9%) with severe disease.\n\n Lymphocytopenia was present in 83.2% of the patients on admission.\n\n\nConclusions\nDuring the first 2 months of the current outbreak, Covid-19 spread rapidly throughout China and caused varying degrees of illness.\n\n Patients often presented without fever, and many did not have abnormal radiologic findings.\n\n (Funded by the National Health Commission of China and

cases of infection with Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus: a report of nosocomial transmission","abstract":"Background\nHuman infection with a novel coronavirus named Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) was first identified in Saudi Arabia and the Middle East in September, 2012, with 44 laboratory-confirmed cases as of May 23, 2013. We report detailed clinical and virological data for two related cases of MERS-CoV disease, after nosocomial transmission of the virus from one patient to another in a French hospital.\n\n\nMethods\nPatient 1 visited Dubai in April, 2013; patient 2 lives in France and did not travel abroad.\n\n Both patients had underlying immunosuppressive disorders.\n\n We tested specimens from the upper (nasopharyngeal swabs) or the lower (bronchoalveolar lavage, sputum) respiratory tract and whole blood, plasma, and serum specimens for MERS-CoV by real-time RT-PCR targeting the upE and Orf1A genes of MERS-CoV.\n\n\nFindings\nInitial clinical presentation included fever, chills, and myalgia in both patients, and for patient 1, diarrhoea.\n\n Respiratory symptoms rapidly became predominant with acute respiratory failure leading to mechanical ventilation and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO).\n\n Both patients developed acute renal failure.\n\n MERS-CoV was detected in lower respiratory tract specimens with high viral load (eg, cycle threshold [Ct] values of 22·9 for upE and 24 for Orf1a for a bronchoalveolar lavage sample from patient 1; Ct values of 22·5 for upE and 23·9 for Orf1a for an induced sputum sample from patient 2), whereas nasopharyngeal specimens were weakly positive or inconclusive.\n\n The two patients shared the same room for 3 days.\n\n The incubation period was estimated at 9–12 days for the second case.\n\n No secondary transmission was documented in hospital staff despite the absence of specific protective measures before the diagnosis of MERS-CoV was suspected.\n\n Patient 1 died on May 28, due to refractory multiple organ failure.\n\n\nInterpretation\nPatients with respiratory symptoms returning from the Middle East or exposed to a confirmed case should be isolated and investigated for MERS-CoV with lower respiratory tract sample analysis and an assumed incubation period of 12 days.\n\n Immunosuppression should also be taken into account as a risk factor.\n\n\nFunding\nFrench Institute for Public Health Surveillance, ANR grant Labex Integrative Biology of Emerging Infectious

host cells","abstract":"id='Par1'>In face of the everlasting battle toward COVID-19 and the rapid evolution of SARS-CoV-2, no specific and effective drugs for treating this disease have been reported until today.\n Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), a receptor of SARS-CoV-2, mediates the virus infection by binding to spike protein.\n Although ACE2 is expressed in the lung, kidney, and intestine, its expressing levels are rather low, especially in the lung.\n Considering the great infectivity of COVID-19, we speculate that SARS-CoV-2 may depend on other routes to facilitate its infection.\n Here, we first discover an interaction between host cell receptor CD147 and SARS-CoV-2 spike protein.\n The loss of CD147 or blocking CD147 in Vero E6 and BEAS-2B cell lines by anti-CD147 antibody, Meplazumab, inhibits SARS-CoV-2 amplification.\n Expression of human CD147 allows virus entry into non-susceptible BHK-21 cells, which can be neutralized by CD147 extracellular fragment.\n Viral loads are detectable in the lungs of human CD147 (hCD147) mice infected with SARS-CoV-2, but not in those of virus-infected wild type mice.\n Interestingly, virions are observed in lymphocytes of lung tissue from a COVID-19 patient.\n Human T cells with a property of ACE2 natural deficiency can be infected with SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus in a dose-dependent manner, which is specifically inhibited by Meplazumab.\n Furthermore, CD147 mediates virus entering host cells by endocytosis.\n Together, our study reveals a novel virus entry route, CD147-spike protein, which provides an important target for developing specific and effective drug against COVID-19.","id":"PMC7714896","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Nature Publishing Group

we examined sex differences in viral loads, SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody titers, plasma cytokines, as well as blood cell phenotyping in COVID-19 patients.\n By focusing our analysis on patients with moderate disease who had not received immunomodulatory medications, our results revealed that male patients had higher plasma levels of innate immune cytokines such as IL-8 and IL-18 along with more robust induction of non-classical monocytes.\n In contrast, female patients mounted significantly more robust T cell activation than male patients during SARS-CoV-2 infection, which was sustained in old age.\n Importantly, we found that a poor T cell response negatively correlated with patients’ age and was associated with worse disease outcome in male patients, but not in female patients.\n Conversely, higher innate immune cytokines in female patients associated with worse disease progression, but not in male patients.\n These findings reveal a possible explanation underlying observed

attracted an international attention as the virus caused multiple healthcare associated outbreaks.\n\n There are reports of the role of asymptomatic individuals in the transmission of MERS-CoV, however, the exact role is not known.\n\n\nMethod\nThe MEDLINE/PubMed and Scopus databases were searched for relevant papers published till August 2018 describing asymptomatic MERS-CoV infection.\n\n\nResults\nA total of 10 papers were retrieved and included in the final analysis and review.\n\n The extent of asymptomatic MERS infection had increased with change in the policy of testing asymptomatic contacts.\n\n In early cases in April 2012–October 2013, 12.5% were asymptomatic among 144 PCR laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV cases while in 2014 the proportion rose to 25.1% among 255 confirmed cases.\n\n The proportion of asymptomatic cases reported among pediatric confirmed MERS-CoV cases were higher (41.9%–81.8%).\n\n Overall, the detection rate of MERS infection among asymptomatic contacts was 1-3.9% in studies included in this review.\n\n Asymptomatic individuals were less likely to have underlying condition compared to fatal cases.\n\n Of particular interest is that most of the identified pediatric cases were asymptomatic with no clear explanation.\n\n\nConclusions\nThe proportion of asymptomatic MERS cases were detected with increasing frequency as the disease progressed overtime.\n\n Those patients were less likely to have comorbid disease and may contribute to the transmission of the

Fatal outcomes of H7N9 infections are often attributed to the severe pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).\n There is urgent need to discover biomarkers predicting the progression of disease and fatal outcome of potentially lethal flu infections, based on sound statistical analysis.\n We discovered that 34 of the 48 cytokines and chemokines examined in this study were significantly elevated in the plasma samples from patients infected with H7N9. We report for the first time that the levels of MIF, SCF, MCP-1, HGF, and SCGF-? are highly positively linked to disease severity and the profile of mediators MIF, SCF, MCP-1, HGF, SCGF-?, IP-10,

with COVID-19 during the first wave of the Italian epidemic: A prospective cohort study\nGraphical abstract\nItaly was the first European country hit by the COVID-19 pandemic and has the highest number of recorded COVID-19 deaths in Europe.\nThis prospective cohort study of the correlates of the risk of death in COVID-19 patients was conducted at the Infectious Diseases and Intensive Care units of Luigi Sacco Hospital, Milan, Italy. The clinical characteristics of all the COVID-19 patients hospitalised in the early days of the epidemic (21 February -19 March 2020) were recorded upon admission, and the time-dependent probability of death was evaluated using the Kaplan-Meier method (censored as of 20 April 2020). Cox proportional hazard models were used to assess the factors independently associated with the risk of death.\nForty-eight (20.6 %) of the 233 patients followed up for a median of 40 days (interquartile range 33-47) died during the follow-up. Most were males (69.1 %) and their median age was 61 years (IQR 50-72). The time-dependent probability of death was 19.7 % (95 % CI 14.6-24.9 %) 30 days after hospital admission. Age (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 2.08, 95 % CI 1.48-2.92 per ten years more) and obesity (aHR 3.04, 95 % CI 1.42-6.49) were independently associated with an increased risk of death, which was also associated with critical disease (aHR 8.26, 95 % CI 1.41-48.29), C-reactive protein levels (aHR 1.17, 95 % CI 1.02-1.35 per 50 mg/L more) and creatinine kinase levels above 185 U/L (aHR 2.58, 95 % CI 1.37-4.87) upon admission. Case-fatality rate of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 in the early days of the Italian epidemic was about 20 %. Our study adds evidence to the notion that older age, obesity and more advanced illness are factors associated to an increased risk of death among patients hospitalized with COVID-19.\nIntroduction\nIn late December 2019, an outbreak of an emerging disease (COVID-19) caused by a novel coronavirus that was later named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was recorded in Wuhan, China, and subsequently rapidly spread to a substantial number of Asian and non-Asian countries. It was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organisation on 12 March 2020.\nThe increasing number of studies conducted in Chinese hospitals over the last few months have contributed to delineating the characteristics of the disease and its lethality. They describe COVID-19 as an atypical SARS-like pneumonia that requires intensive care in 26-33 % of patients, 4-15 % of whom eventually die. However, as the epidemic moves outside China, there is a need to verify the clinical features and lethality of COVID-19 in countries with different demographic characteristics.\nItaly was the first European country to be hit hard by the COVID-19 epidemic, with Lombardy in northern Italy being the region in which the first autochthonous cases were identified and the largest epidemic foci developed. Italy is also the European country in which the highest number of COVID-19 deaths have so far been recorded (24,780 as of 27 April 2020).\nThe Department of Infectious Diseases of Luigi Sacco Hospital (the national reference centre for epidemiological emergencies and bioterrorism in northern Italy) has been admitting SARS-CoV-2 patients (particularly those coming from the &quot;red zone&quot; municipalities first involved in the epidemic) since the night of 20 February 2020, when the first COVID-19 case was identified in a town about 50 km from Milan.\nThis paper describes the demographic and clinical characteristics of the COVID-19 patients admitted to our hospital between 21 February and 19 March 2020 in the early stage of the Italian epidemic, and the factors associated with the risk of COVID-19-related death.\nMaterials and methods\nSetting\nThe study was conducted in the continuously evolving scenario created by the dramatic escalation of the COVID-19 epidemic in Lombardy. The large structural changes that had to be made in the organisation of our hospital over a 2-week period transformed our 68-bed Department of Infectious Diseases and 8-bed general intensive care unit (ICU) into a single-building isolation area with 93 non-intensive and 30 intensive care beds entirely dedicated to COVID-19 patients.\nStudy design and participants\nThis was a single-centre, prospective cohort study of all of the adult COVID-19 patients admitted to Luigi Sacco Hospital in Milan, Italy, between 21 February (the day the first patients were hospitalised) to 19 March 2020; the observation of the cohort was censored on 20 April 2020. All of the study patients had COVID-19 confirmed by a positive real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction on a nasopharyngeal swab.\nData collection\nThe data extracted from the patients' clinical charts on a daily basis and stored in an ad hoc database included age and gender; the reported date of symptom onset; body weight and height, the presence of obesity defined as a body mass index &gt;= 30 points, and history of smoking; comorbidity burden defined assessed by age unadjusted Charlson comorbidity index and concomitant treatments for chronic medical conditions; symptoms; vital signs (heart rate, respiratory rate, blood pressure, pulse oximetry), laboratory values (white blood cell, neutrophil, lymphocyte, and platelet counts; hemoglobin, albumin, lactate dehydrogenase, C-reactive protein (CRP), creatine kinase (CK), alanine aminotransferase, bilirubin, prothrombin, D-dimer, and creatinine levels; and arterial oxygen partial pressure); radiography findings upon admission. The chest X-ray images were reviewed and categorised as follows: no pathological findings; interstitial changes; monolateral lung consolidation(s); bilateral lung consolidation(s); and pleural effusion (yes/no). Oxygen therapy support started upon hospital admission, and its type (simple face mask, face mask with oxygen reservoir bag, Venturi-type oxygen mask, continuous positive airway pressure device (cPAP), and mechanical ventilation) were collected.\nUsing the criteria proposed by Wu et al., disease severity upon admission was classified as mild (mild clinical symptoms, no imaging signs of pneumonia); moderate (fever, cough, dyspnoea or other symptoms, imaging signs of pneumonia); severe (any of: respiratory distress with a respiratory rate (RR) of &gt;=30 breaths per minute; resting oxygen saturation in air &lt;=93 %; or PaO2 / FiO2 &lt;= 300 mmHg); and critical (any of respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation; shock; or any other organ failure needing intensive care).\nData on the use of antivirals [lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r) and remdesivir], and/or antibiotic and/or immunomodulatory agents [hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), tocilizumab] during hospitalization were also collected.\nThe primary outcome of interest was death; the life status of the patients discharged before the censoring date was ascertained by means of telephone calls made by two physicians on 20 April, 2020.\nData analysis\nThe descriptive statistics include proportions for categorical variable, and median values and interquartile range (IQR) for continuous variables. The baseline demographic and clinico-epidemiological characteristics of the survivors and non-survivors were compared using chi2 or Fisher's exact test where necessary for categorical variables and Wilcoxon's rank-sum test for continuous variables.\nThe time-dependent probability of death during the study period was assessed using the Kaplan-Meir method.\nThe association(s) between clinically relevant, non-collinear and complete variables (without any missing data upon hospital admission) and the primary outcome was assessed by means of uni- and multivariable Cox proportional hazard models. The multivariable analysis was made by introducing into the model the variables that found to be significantly associated with outcome in the univariate analysis, as well as potential confounders.\nAll of the statistical analyses were made using SAS software, version 9.4, and differences with P values of &lt;0.05 were considered statistically significant.\nThe study was approved by our Comitato Etico Interaziendale Area 1. Informed consent was waived in the case of patients undergoing mechanical ventilation upon admission.\nResults\nBetween 21 February and 19 March 2020, a total of 233 COVID-19 patients were admitted to L. Sacco Hospital, Milan, Italy. Most were males (69.1 %) of Italian nationality (92.8 %), and their median age was 61 years (IQR 50-72). Twenty-six (11.2 %) were healthcare workers. A total of 133 (57.1 %) were resident in the city or metropolitan area of Milan (the first case in Milan was recorded on 23 February 2020). Twenty-seven (11.6 %) came from the &quot;red zones&quot; and 71 were transferred from other provinces in Lombardy (Lodi, Cremona, and Bergamo) whose hospitals were overwhelmed by the sudden explosion of the epidemic.\nForty-eight patients (20.6 %) died during the study period, and 185 survived, including 162 (69.5 %) patients who were discharged, and 23 (9.9 %) who were still hospitalised on the censoring date.\nCharacteristics upon hospital admission of the COVID-19 patients who or died during the study period.\nTable 1	 	\nCharacteristic	Total(n = 233)	Survivors(n = 185)	Non-survivors(n = 48)	P	 	Gender, n (%) Male Female	161 (69.1)72 (30.9)	122 (65.9)63 (34.1)	39 (81.2)9 (18.8)	0.053	 	Age in years, n (%)	 	 18-25	2 (0.9)	2 (1.1)	0 (0.0)	&lt;0.001	 	 26-35	16 (6.9)	16 (8.6)	0 (0.0)		 	 36-45	23 (9.9)	22 (11.9)	1 (2.1)		 	 46-55	37 (15.9)	35 (18.9)	2 (4.2)		 	 56-65	56 (24.0)	45 (24.3)	11 (22.9)		 	 66-75	55 (23.6)	36 (19.5)	19 (39.6)		 	 76-85	34 (14.6)	24 (13.0)	10 (20.8)		 	 86-95	10 (4.3)	5 (2.7)	5 (10.4)		 	Transferred from other hospitals, n (%)	98 (42.1)	68 (36.8)	30 (62.5)	0.002	 	History of smoking, n (%)	 	 No	163 (70.0)	132 (71.4)	31 (64.6)	0.362	 	 Yes	70 (30.0)	53 (28.6)	17 (35.4)		 	Obesity$, n (%)	38 (16.3)	25 (13.5)	13 (27.1)	0.029	 	Median age unadjusted Charlson Comorbidity Index (IQR)	0 (0-1)	0 (0-1)	1 (0-2)	0.002	 	Medications received for chronic conditions, n (%)	 	 None	79 (33.9)	70 (37.8)	9 (18.8)	0.016	 	 Anti-platelet agents	33 (14.2)	20 (10.8)	13 (27.1)	0.009	 	 Anti-coagulant agents	17 (7.3)	12 (6.5)	5 (10.4)	0.355	 	 Acid-lowering agents	41 (17.6)	28 (15.1)	13 (27.1)	0.059	 	 Lipid-lowering agents	39 (16.7)	28 (15.1)	11 (22.9)	0.199	 	 At least one anti-hypertensive agent	85 (36.5)	57 (30.8)	28 (58.3)	0.001	 	Calcium channel blockers	36 (15.5)	23 (12.4)	13 (27.1)	0.023	 	Beta-blockers	33 (14.2)	23 (12.4)	10 (20.8)	0.163	 	ARBs	31 (13.3)	17 (9.2)	14 (29.2)	0.001	 	ACE inhibitors	31 (13.3)	22 (11.9)	9 (18.8)	0.234	 	Diuretics	25 (10.7)	16 (8.6)	9 (18.8)	0.064	 	 Anti-arrhythmic agents	10 (4.3)	9 (4.9)	1 (2.1)	0.692	 	 Oral hypoglycemic agents	22 (9.4)	17 (9.2)	5 (10.4)	0.784	 	 Insulin	7 (3.0)	4 (2.2)	3 (6.2)	0.156	 	 Nervous system agents*	28 (12.0)	20 (10.8)	8 (16.7)	0.318	 	 Steroids/immunomodulators	9 (3.9)	6 (3.2)	3 (6.2)	0.396	 	 Inhaled steroids	7 (3.0)	4 (2.2)	3 (6.2)	0.156	 	Median time from onset of illness (IQR), days	7 (4-9)	6 (4-9)	7 (4-9)	0.970	 	Symptoms, n (%)					 	 Cough	121 (51.9)	99 (53.5)	22 (45.8)	0.418	 	 Dyspnea	82 (35.2)	67 (36.2)	15 (31.2)	0.612	 	 Sore throat	11 (4.7)	11 (5.9)	0 (0.0)	0.126	 	 Arthralgia/myalgia	12 (5.2)	11 (5.9)	1 (2.1)	0.468	 	 Headache	12 (5.2)	12 (6.5)	0 (0.0)	0.134	 	 Asthenia	28 (12.0)	21 (11.4)	7 (14.6)	0.618	 	 Vomiting and/or diarrhea	24 (10.3)	22 (11.9)	2 (4.2)	0.180	 	Signs, n (%) or median (IQR)					 	 Fever &gt;37.3  C	156 (67.0)	125 (67.6)	31 (64.6)	0.732	 	 Body temperature ( C)	38 (37.3-38.6)	38.0 (37.2-38.6)	38.0 (37.4-38.4)	0.903	 	 Systolic blood pressure, mm Hg	125 (118-140)	125 (119-140)	130 (117-150)	0.421	 	 Diastolic blood pressure, mm Hg	75 (70-80)	75 (70-80)	75 (62.5-87.5)	0.881	 	 Pulse, beats per minute	86 (76-100)	86 (77-100)	83 (75-100)	0.806	 	 Respiratory rate, breaths per minute	21 (18-28)	20 (18-26)	24 (20-30)	0.009	 	 Percutaneous oxygen saturation, %	95 (93-97)	95 (93-97)	94.5 (90-97)	0.169	 	X-ray signs of lung changes, n (%)					 	 No alterations	32 (13.7)	30 (16.2)	2 (4.2)	0.033	 	 Interstitial changes	119 (51.1)	100 (54.1)	19 (39.6)	0.078	 	 Monolateral consolidation(s)	139 (59.7)	115 (62.2)	24 (50.0)	0.139	 	 Bilateral consolidation(s)	85 (36.5)	71 (38.4)	14 (29.2)	0.313	 	 Pleural effusion	17 (7.3)	11 (5.9)	6 (12.5)	0.127	 	Oxygen therapy, n (%)	 	 No	96 (41.2)	89 (48.1)	7 (14.6)	&lt;0.0001	 	 Simple face mask	49 (21.0)	35 (18.9)	14 (29.2)		 	 Venturi-type oxygen mask	36 (15.5)	31 (16.8)	5 (10.4)		 	 Face mask with oxygen reservoir bag	15 (6.4)	10 (5.4)	5 (10.4)		 	 Continuous positive airway pressure (cPAP)	29 (12.4)	19 (10.3)	10 (20.8)		 	 Mechanical ventilation	8 (3.4)	1 (0.5)	7 (14.6)		 	Disease severity , n (%)					 	 Mild	32 (13.7)	30 (16.2)	2 (4.2)	&lt;0.001	 	 Moderate	113 (48.5)	94 (50.8)	19 (39.6)		 	 Severe	80 (34.3)	60 (32.4)	20 (41.7)		 	 Critical	8 (3.4)	1 (0.5)	7 (14.6)		 	\nIQR = interquartile range; cPAP = continuous positive airway pressure; ARBs = Angiotensin II receptor blockers.\ndefined as a body mass index &gt;=30.\nNervous system agents: anti-epileptics, benzodiazepine, anti-psychotics, anti-depressants.\nAs classified by Wu et al..\n Table 1 shows the differences in the baseline demographic and clinical characteristics of the survivors and non-survivors. The non-survivors included a higher proportion of subjects aged 66-75 (39.6 % vs 19.5 %), 76-85 (20.8 % vs 13.0 %), and 86-95 years (10.4 % vs 2.7 %) (p &lt; 0.001); a higher proportion of patients transferred from other hospitals (62.5 % vs 36.8 %, p &lt; 0.002). The non-survivors were more frequently being treated with anti-platelet agents (p = 0.009), calcium channel blockers (p = 0.023) and angiotensin II receptor blockers (p = 0.001). Conversely, the survivors were more frequently without any co-medication on hospital admission when compared to the non-survivors (37.8 % vs 18.8 %, p = 0.016).\nThere were no significant between-group differences in terms of time from the onset of symptoms to hospital admission (overall median 7 days, IQR 4-9), and no significant differences in symptoms and signs upon admission. The most frequent presenting signs were fever, cough and dyspnea in both groups.\nA higher proportion of survivors had chest X-rays without any pathological findings (16.2 % vs 4.2 %; p = 0.033), but there was no difference in the pathological X-ray patterns between the two groups.

Age (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 2.08, 95 % CI 1.48-2.92 per ten years more) and obesity (aHR 3.04, 95 % CI 1.42-6.49) were independently associated with an increased risk of death, which was also associated with critical disease (aHR 8.26, 95 % CI 1.41-48.29), CRP levels (aHR 1.17, 95 % CI 1.02-1.35 per 50 mg/L more) and CK levels above 185 U/L (aHR 2.58, 95 % CI 1.37-4.87) upon admission. Conversely, the multivariable model did not confirm the univariable findings of an increased risk of death in patients receiving at least one anti-hypertensive agent, those with anemia, or those with D-dimer levels of &gt;1000 mug/L upon admission.\nDiscussion\nWe studied the characteristics and outcome of 233 adult COVID-19 patients hospitalised in Milan during the early dramatic days of the Italian epidemic. Forty-eight patients (20.6 %) died during the study period, with the probability of dying at 30 days from hospital admission being of 19.7 %. The overall case fatality rate observed in our cohort was similar to that found in a recent study of 201 COVID-19 patients hospitalised in Wuhan, but higher when compared to the 14 % estimated by Wu et al. in the early period of the epidemic in China.\nIn line with the findings of some Chinese studies, our patients were prevalently male, which suggests a gender-based need for different hospital care during SARS-CoV-2 infection. It has been suggested that males may be more prone to developing severe and fatal COVID-19, and recent data regarding the epidemic in Europe shows a male-to-female death ratio of 2.1 that increases to 3.9 in patients aged 50-65 years. However, our multivariable analysis did not reveal a significant gender-based difference in the survival rate. The male/female ratio among the patients admitted to our hospital during study period was 2.24, and so the reasons for the findings of the preliminary European report may be that females are less likely to be hospitalised with COVID-19.\nThe median age of our patients was 61 years which was similar to that reported in a recent large case series from the New York city area (63 years, IQR 52-75), as against the 47-56 years reported in studies of Chinese hospitals; like the fact that the proportion of our patients aged &gt;75 years was 18.9 %, this difference probably mirrors the demographic differences between Italy and China. Preliminary data from Chinese studies indicated that COVID-19 was more lethal in the elderly than younger people, and we also found that an older age was an independent risk factor for death, as in the case of SARS and Middle East respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus. It has been speculated that older patients may be more likely to die of COVID-19 because age-related alterations in immunological functions and type 2 cytokine production lead to deficiencies in controlling SARS-CoV-2 replication and pro-inflammatory responses.\nOur analysis showed that obese patients had a 3-fold higher risk of dying as compared to those with a body mass index below 30. This finding is in line with recently published studies suggesting that obesity represents one of the most important factors related to COVID-19 severity as evidenced by higher need of hospitalization and of invasive mechanical ventilation. Several mechanisms have been proposed to explain the increased severity of COVID-19 in obese patients, including the combination of reduced cardiorespiratory reserve and impairment of adaptive immune response to infections It should be notice that the proportion of obese patients in our cohort was much lower than that recently described in a large case series by Richardson et al. (16.3 % vs 41.7 %) and it cannot be excluded that in countries with high prevalence rate of obesity the effect of this condition on the burden of COVID-19 related mortality may be greater.\nIn line with the findings of previous Chinese studies, fever, cough and dyspnoea were the most frequent signs/symptoms at the time of hospital admission; however, there was no significant difference between survivors and non-survivors in terms of symptoms upon admission.\nThe most frequent chest X-ray alterations were monolateral consolidations and interstitial alterations, followed by bilateral lung consolidations; however, no lung alterations were detected at x-ray in 13.7 % of cases.\nMost of our patients had mild or moderate disease but, as expected, greater disease severity at the time of admission was strongly associated with an increased risk of death; in particular, the patients presenting with critical disease requiring assistance in ICU were at 8 times higher risk than those who did not.\nIn line with the study by Luo et al. we found that serum CRP level upon admission was independently associated with adverse outcome of COVID-19. It has been shown that in pulmonary diseases marked by inflammatory features there is a typical raise in serum CRP level in response to inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6, IL-1 or TNF-alpha.. Thus, higher CRP level in non-survivors of our study may indicate excessive and dangerous inflammatory response. We also found a significant correlation between higher CK levels upon admission and the risk of death. Elevated level of CK in COVID-19 patients might be a sign of respiratory muscle injury resulting from the increased demands placed on the respiratory system. There also previous evidence suggesting that serum levels of CK may rise in patients with pneumonia and pulmonary embolic disease. Furthermore, it cannot be excluded that the increase in CK values in COVID-19 may be related to a damage to CK-rich tissues, such as skeletal and cardiac muscle and brain, directly induced by the virus or maladaptive immune responses. Autopsy studies are required to define the damage of organs that can cause CK increase during COVID-9.\nOur study has a number of limitations. Firstly, as in China, the dramatically evolving scenario of the epidemic in Italy required continuous structural, organisational and staff changes that exposed the study to maturation bias. In particular, the number of laboratory examinations performed upon admission was limited (i.e. Interleukine-6 determination became available only after 15 days from the start of the study). Secondly, only 14.8 % of our patients underwent a chest computed tomography upon admission because of barriers in our infrastructure created in order to ensure a dedicated COVID-19 service. Thirdly, it was difficult to ascertain the different effects on outcomes of the miscellaneous and often concomitant drug treatments given to our patients because of the absence of a standard of care for COVID-19 (excluding oxygen supplementation). Nevertheless, as all of the patients admitted to our Infectious Diseases Department were enrolled in this study and the study population was probably representative of the COVID-19 patients hospitalised in Italy in the early stage of the epidemic.\nIn conclusion, case-fatality rate of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 in the early days of the Italian epidemic was about 20 %. Older age, obesity, disease severity upon admission were factors related with increased risk of death. Further studies are needed to evaluate pathogenic mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 and the effect of the several proposed therapeutic approaches in reducing its lethality. Moreover, long term post discharge follow-up is warranted to provide a more accurate estimate of the morbidity and mortality attributable to this infection.\nDeclaration of Competing Interest\nThe authors declare that there are no conflicts of interest.\nAuthors contribution\nAG, ALR and MG designed the study.

showed bilateral pneumonia, 14 (14%) patients showed multiple mottling and ground-glass opacity, and one (1%) patient had pneumothorax.\n\n 17 (17%) patients developed acute respiratory distress syndrome and, among them, 11 (11%) patients worsened in a short period of time and died of multiple organ failure.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe 2019-nCoV infection was of clustering onset, is more likely to affect older males with comorbidities, and can result in severe and even fatal respiratory diseases such as acute respiratory distress syndrome.\n\n In general, characteristics of patients who died were in line with the MuLBSTA score, an early warning model for predicting mortality in viral pneumonia.\n\n Further investigation is needed to explore the applicability of the MuLBSTA score in predicting the risk of mortality in 2019-nCoV infection.\n\n\nFunding\nNational Key R&amp;D Program of China.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7135076","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Elsevier

novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).\n\n We report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatment and clinical outcomes of these patients.\n\n\nMethods\nAll patients with suspected 2019-nCoV were admitted to a designated hospital in Wuhan.\n\n We prospectively collected and analysed data on patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection by real-time RT-PCR and next-generation sequencing.\n\n Data were obtained with standardised data collection forms shared by WHO and the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium from electronic medical records.\n\n Researchers also directly communicated with patients or their families to ascertain epidemiological and symptom data.\n\n Outcomes were also compared between patients who had been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and those who had not.\n\n\nFindings\nBy Jan 2, 2020, 41 admitted hospital patients had been identified as having laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection.\n\n Most of the infected patients were men (30 [73%] of 41); less than half had underlying diseases (13 [32%]), including diabetes (eight [20%]), hypertension (six [15%]), and cardiovascular disease (six [15%]).\n\n Median age was 49·0 years (IQR 41·0–58·0).\n\n 27 (66%) of 41 patients had been exposed to Huanan seafood market.\n\n One family cluster was found.\n\n Common symptoms at onset of illness were fever (40 [98%] of 41 patients), cough (31 [76%]), and myalgia or fatigue (18 [44%]); less common symptoms were sputum production (11 [28%] of 39), headache (three [8%] of 38), haemoptysis (two [5%] of 39), and diarrhoea (one [3%] of 38).\n\n Dyspnoea developed in 22 (55%) of 40 patients (median time from illness onset to dyspnoea 8·0 days [IQR

characterisation and epidemiology of 2019 novel coronavirus: implications for virus origins and receptor binding","abstract":"Background\nIn late December, 2019, patients presenting with viral pneumonia due to an unidentified microbial agent were reported in Wuhan, China.\n\n A novel coronavirus was subsequently identified as the causative pathogen, provisionally named 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).\n\n As of Jan 26, 2020, more than 2000 cases of 2019-nCoV infection have been confirmed, most of which involved people living in or visiting Wuhan, and human-to-human transmission has been confirmed.\n\n\nMethods\nWe did next-generation sequencing of samples from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and cultured isolates from nine inpatients, eight of whom had visited the Huanan seafood market in Wuhan.\n\n Complete and partial 2019-nCoV genome sequences were obtained from these individuals.\n\n Viral contigs were connected using Sanger sequencing to obtain the full-length genomes, with the terminal regions determined by rapid amplification of cDNA ends.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these 2019-nCoV genomes and those of other coronaviruses was used to determine the evolutionary history of the virus and help infer its likely origin.\n\n Homology modelling was done to explore the likely receptor-binding properties of the virus.\n\n\nFindings\nThe ten genome sequences of 2019-nCoV obtained from the nine patients were extremely similar, exhibiting more than 99·98% sequence identity.\n\n Notably, 2019-nCoV was closely related (with 88% identity) to two bat-derived severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-like coronaviruses, bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21, collected in 2018 in Zhoushan, eastern China, but were more distant from SARS-CoV (about 79%) and MERS-CoV (about 50%).\n\n Phylogenetic analysis revealed that 2019-nCoV fell within the subgenus Sarbecovirus of the genus Betacoronavirus, with a relatively long branch length to its closest relatives bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21, and was genetically distinct from SARS-CoV.\n\n Notably, homology modelling revealed that 2019-nCoV had a similar receptor-binding domain structure to that of SARS-CoV, despite amino acid variation at some key residues.\n\n\nInterpretation\n2019-nCoV is sufficiently divergent from SARS-CoV to be considered a new human-infecting betacoronavirus.\n\n Although our phylogenetic analysis suggests that bats might be the original host of this virus, an animal sold at the seafood market in Wuhan might represent an intermediate host facilitating the emergence of the virus in humans.\n\n Importantly, structural analysis suggests that 2019-nCoV might be able to bind to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor in humans.\n\n The

Cases exported domestically were then estimated.\n\n We forecasted the national and global spread of 2019-nCoV, accounting for the effect of the metropolitan-wide quarantine of Wuhan and surrounding cities, which began Jan 23–24, 2020. We used data on monthly flight bookings from the Official Aviation Guide and data on human mobility across more than 300 prefecture-level cities in mainland China from the Tencent database.\n\n Data on confirmed cases were obtained from the reports published by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\n Serial interval estimates were based on previous studies of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV).\n\n A susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered metapopulation model was used to simulate the epidemics across all major cities in China.\n\n The basic reproductive number was estimated using Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods and presented using the resulting posterior mean and 95% credibile interval (CrI).\n\n\nFindings\nIn our baseline scenario, we estimated that the basic reproductive number for 2019-nCoV was 2·68 (95% CrI 2·47–2·86) and that 75?815 individuals (95% CrI 37?304–130?330) have been infected in Wuhan as of Jan 25, 2020. The epidemic doubling time was 6·4 days (95% CrI 5·8–7·1).\n\n We estimated that in the baseline scenario, Chongqing, Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Shenzhen had imported 461 (95% CrI 227–805), 113 (57–193), 98 (49–168), 111 (56–191), and 80 (40–139) infections from Wuhan, respectively.\n\n If the transmissibility of 2019-nCoV were similar everywhere domestically and over time, we inferred that epidemics are already growing exponentially in multiple major cities of China with a lag time behind the Wuhan outbreak of about 1–2 weeks.\n\n\nInterpretation\nGiven that 2019-nCoV is no longer contained within Wuhan, other major Chinese cities are probably sustaining localised outbreaks.\n\n Large cities overseas with close transport links to China could also become outbreak epicentres, unless substantial public health interventions at both the population and personal levels are implemented immediately.\n\n Independent self-sustaining outbreaks in major cities globally could become inevitable because of substantial exportation of presymptomatic cases and in the absence of large-scale public health interventions.\n\n Preparedness plans and mitigation interventions should be

common symptoms.\n\n Most patients had a normal white blood cell count (37 of 51, 73%), neutrophil count (44 of 51, 86%), and either normal (17 of 51, 35%) or reduced (33 of 51, 65%) lymphocyte count.\n\n CT images showed pure ground-glass opacity (GGO) in 39 of 51 (77%) patients and GGO with reticular and/or interlobular septal thickening in 38 of 51 (75%) patients.\n\n GGO with consolidation was present in 30 of 51 (59%) patients, and pure consolidation was present in 28 of 51 (55%) patients.\n\n Forty-four of 51 (86%) patients had bilateral lung involvement, while 41 of 51 (80%) involved the posterior part of the lungs and 44 of 51 (86%) were peripheral.\n\n There were more consolidated lung lesions in patients 5 days or more from disease onset to CT scan versus 4 days or fewer (431 of 712 lesions vs 129 of 612 lesions; P &lt; .\n\n001).\n\n Patients older than 50 years had more consolidated lung lesions than did those aged 50 years or younger (212 of 470 vs 198 of 854; P &lt; .\n\n001).\n\n Follow-up CT in 13 patients showed improvement in seven (54%) patients and progression in four (31%) patients.\n\n\nConclusion\nPatients with fever and/or cough and with conspicuous ground-glass opacity lesions in the peripheral and posterior lungs on CT images, combined with normal or decreased white blood cells and a history of epidemic exposure, are highly suspected of having 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) pneumonia.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7233366","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Radiological Society of North

public health and medicinal measures will both be needed to contain spreading of the virus and to optimize patient outcomes.\n Although little is known about the virus, an examination of the genome

face bacterial, fungal and viral infections in the 21st century","abstract":"Chloroquine (CQ) and its hydroxyl analogue hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) are weak bases with a half-century long use as antimalarial agents.\n Apart from this antimalarial activity, CQ and HCQ have gained interest in the field of other infectious diseases.\n One of the most interesting mechanisms of action is that CQ leads to alkalinisation of acid vesicles that inhibit the growth of several intracellular bacteria and fungi.\n The proof of concept of this effect was first used to restore intracellular pH allowing antibiotic efficacy for Coxiella burnetii, the agent of Q fever, and doxycycline plus HCQ is now the reference treatment for chronic Q fever.\n There is also strong evidence of a similar effect in vitro against Tropheryma whipplei, the agent of Whipple's disease, and a clinical trial is in progress.\n Other bacteria and fungi multiply in an acidic environment and encouraging in vitro data suggest that this concept may be generalised for all intracellular organisms that multiply in an acidic environment.\n For viruses, CQ led to inhibition of uncoating and/or alteration of post-translational modifications of newly synthesised proteins, especially inhibition of glycosylation.\n These effects have been well described in vitro for many viruses, with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) being the most studied.\n Preliminary in vivo clinical trials suggest that CQ alone or in combination with antiretroviral drugs might represent an interesting way to treat HIV infection.\n In conclusion, our review re-emphasises the paradigm that activities mediated by lysosomotropic agents may offer an interesting weapon to face present and future infectious diseases

coronavirus indicating person-to-person transmission: a study of a family cluster","abstract":"Background\nAn ongoing outbreak of pneumonia associated with a novel coronavirus was reported in Wuhan city, Hubei province, China.\n\n Affected patients were geographically linked with a local wet market as a potential source.\n\n No data on person-to-person or nosocomial transmission have been published to date.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this study, we report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, radiological, and microbiological findings of five patients in a family cluster who presented with unexplained pneumonia after returning to Shenzhen, Guangdong province, China, after a visit to Wuhan, and an additional family member who did not travel to Wuhan.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of genetic sequences from these patients were done.\n\n\nFindings\nFrom Jan 10, 2020, we enrolled a family of six patients who travelled to Wuhan from Shenzhen between Dec 29, 2019 and Jan 4, 2020. Of six family members who travelled to Wuhan, five were identified as infected with the novel coronavirus.\n\n Additionally, one family member, who did not travel to Wuhan, became infected with the virus after several days of contact with four of the family members.\n\n None of the family members had contacts with Wuhan markets or animals, although two had visited a Wuhan hospital.\n\n Five family members (aged 36–66 years) presented with fever, upper or lower respiratory tract symptoms, or diarrhoea, or a combination of these 3–6 days after exposure.\n\n They presented to our hospital (The University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen) 6–10 days after symptom onset.\n\n They and one asymptomatic child (aged 10 years) had radiological ground-glass lung opacities.\n\n Older patients (aged &gt;60 years) had more systemic symptoms, extensive radiological ground-glass lung changes, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and increased C-reactive protein and lactate dehydrogenase levels.\n\n The nasopharyngeal or throat swabs of these six patients were negative for known respiratory microbes by point-of-care multiplex RT-PCR, but five patients (four adults and the child) were RT-PCR positive for genes encoding the internal RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and surface Spike protein of this novel coronavirus, which were confirmed by Sanger sequencing.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these five patients' RT-PCR amplicons and two full genomes by next-generation sequencing showed that this is a novel coronavirus, which is closest to the bat severe acute respiatory syndrome (SARS)-related coronaviruses found in Chinese horseshoe bats.\n\n\nInterpretation\nOur findings are consistent with person-to-person transmission of this novel coronavirus in hospital and family settings, and the reports of infected travellers in other geographical regions.\n\n\nFunding\nThe Shaw Foundation Hong Kong, Michael Seak-Kan Tong, Respiratory Viral Research Foundation Limited, Hui

January 2020. We analyzed data on the first 425 confirmed cases in Wuhan to determine the epidemiologic characteristics of NCIP.\n\n\nMethods\nWe collected information on demographic characteristics, exposure history, and illness timelines of laboratory-confirmed cases of NCIP that had been reported by January 22, 2020. We described characteristics of the cases and estimated the key epidemiologic time-delay distributions.\n\n In the early period of exponential growth, we estimated the epidemic doubling time and the basic reproductive number.\n\n\nResults\nAmong the first 425 patients with confirmed NCIP, the median age was 59 years and 56% were male.\n\n The majority of cases (55%) with onset before January 1, 2020, were linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, as compared with 8.6% of the subsequent cases.\n\n The mean incubation period was 5.2 days (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.1 to 7.0), with the 95th percentile of the distribution at 12.5 days.\n\n In its early stages, the epidemic doubled in size every 7.4 days.\n\n With a mean serial interval of 7.5 days (95% CI, 5.3 to 19), the basic reproductive number was estimated to be 2.2 (95% CI, 1.4 to 3.9).\n\n\nConclusions\nOn the basis of this information, there is evidence that human-to-human transmission has occurred among close contacts since the middle of December 2019.

outcomes in patients with a number of different malignancies.\n\n The objective of this study was to assess the relationship between NLR and mortality in a population of adult critically ill patients.\n\n\nMethods\nWe performed an observational cohort study of unselected intensive care unit (ICU) patients based on records in a large clinical database.\n\n We computed individual patient NLR and categorized patients by quartile of this ratio.\n\n The association of NLR quartiles and 28-day mortality was assessed using multivariable logistic regression.\n\n Secondary outcomes included mortality in the ICU, in-hospital mortality and 1-year mortality.\n\n An a priori subgroup analysis of patients with versus without sepsis was performed to assess any differences in the relationship between the NLR and outcomes in these cohorts.\n\n\nResults\nA total of 5,056 patients were included.\n\n Their 28-day mortality rate was 19%.\n\n The median age of the cohort was 65 years, and 47% were female.\n\n The median NLR for the entire cohort was 8.9 (interquartile range, 4.99 to 16.21).\n\n Following multivariable adjustments, there was a stepwise increase in mortality with increasing quartiles of NLR (first quartile: reference category; second quartile odds ratio (OR) = 1.32; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.03 to 1.71; third quartile OR = 1.43; 95% CI, 1.12 to 1.83; 4th quartile

to 916 deaths around the world.\n\n However, there have been few epidemiological studies of SARS comparing epidemiologic features across regions.\n\n The aim of this study is to identify similarities and differences in SARS epidemiology in three populations with similar host and viral genotype.\n\n\nMethods\nWe present a comparative epidemiologic analysis of SARS, based on an integrated dataset with 3,336 SARS patients from Hong Kong, Beijing and Taiwan, epidemiological and clinical characteristics such as incubation, onset-to-admission, onset-to-discharge and onset-to-death periods, case fatality ratios (CFRs) and presenting symptoms are described and compared between regions.\n\n We further explored the influence of demographic and clinical variables on the apparently large differences in CFRs between the three regions.\n\n\nResults\nAll three regions showed similar incubation periods and progressive shortening of the onset-to-admission interval through the epidemic.\n\n Adjusted for sex, health care worker status and nosocomial setting, older age was associated with a higher fatality, with adjusted odds ratio (AOR): 2.10 (95% confidence interval: 1.45, 3.04) for those aged 51-60; AOR: 4.57 (95% confidence interval: 3.32, 7.30) for those aged above 60 compared to those aged 41-50 years.\n\n Presence of pre-existing comorbid conditions was also associated with greater mortality (AOR: 1.74; 95% confidence interval: 1.36, 2.21).\n\n\nConclusion\nThe large discrepancy in crude fatality ratios across the three regions can only be partly explained by epidemiological and clinical heterogeneities.\n\n Our findings underline the importance of a common data collection platform, especially in an emerging epidemic, in order to identify and explain consistencies and differences in the eventual clinical and public health outcomes of infectious disease outbreaks, which is becoming increasingly important in our highly interconnected world.\n\n\n","id":"PMC2846944","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"BioMed Central","authors":[{"firstname":"Eric

Feb 28, 2018, 2182 cases of MERS-CoV infection (with 779 deaths) in 27 countries were reported to WHO worldwide, with most being reported in Saudi Arabia (1807 cases with 705 deaths).\n MERS-CoV features prominently in the WHO blueprint list of priority pathogens that threaten global health security.\n Although primary transmission of MERS-CoV to human beings is linked to exposure to dromedary camels (Camelus dromedarius), the exact mode by which MERS-CoV infection is acquired remains undefined.\n Up to 50% of MERS-CoV cases in Saudi Arabia have been classified as secondary, occurring from human-to-human transmission through contact with asymptomatic or symptomatic individuals infected with MERS-CoV.\n Hospital outbreaks of MERS-CoV are a hallmark of MERS-CoV infection.\n The clinical features associated with MERS-CoV infection are not MERS-specific and are similar to other respiratory tract infections.\n Thus, the diagnosis of MERS can easily be missed, unless the doctor or health-care worker has a high degree of clinical awareness and the patient undergoes specific testing for MERS-CoV.\n The largest outbreak of MERS-CoV outside the Arabian Peninsula occurred in South Korea in May, 2015, resulting in 186 cases with 38 deaths.\n This outbreak was caused by a traveller with undiagnosed MERS-CoV infection who became ill after returning to Seoul from a trip to the Middle East.\n The traveller visited several health facilities in South Korea, transmitting the virus to many other individuals long before a diagnosis was made.\n With 10 million pilgrims visiting Saudi Arabia each year from 182 countries, watchful surveillance by public health systems, and a high degree of clinical awareness of the possibility of MERS-CoV infection is essential.\n In this Review, we provide a comprehensive update and synthesis of the latest available data on the epidemiology, determinants, and risk factors of primary, household, and nosocomial transmission of MERS-CoV, and suggest measures to reduce risk of transmission.\n","id":"PMC7164784","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Elsevier Ltd.","authors":[{"firstname":"David

data: an application to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS)","abstract":"For diseases with some level of associated mortality, the case fatality ratio measures the proportion of diseased individuals who die from the disease.\n In principle, it is straightforward to estimate this quantity from individual follow?up data that provides times from onset to death or recovery.\n In particular, in a competing risks context, the case fatality ratio is defined by the limiting value of the sub?distribution function, F\n1(t) = Pr(T ?t and J = 1), associated with death, as t ? ?, where T denotes the time from onset to death (J = 1) or recovery (J = 2).\n When censoring is present, however, estimation of F\n1(?) is complicated by the possibility of little information regarding the right tail of F\n1, requiring use of estimators of F\n1(t*) or F\n1(t\n*)/(F\n1(t\n*)+F\n2(t\n*)) where t\n* is large, with F\n2(t) = Pr(T ?t and J = 2) being the analogous sub?distribution function associated with recovery.\n With right censored data, the variability of such estimators increases as t\n* increases, suggesting the possibility of using estimators at lower values of t\n* where bias may be increased but overall mean squared error be smaller.\n These issues are investigated here for non?parametric estimators of F\n1 and F\n2.\n The ideas are illustrated on case fatality data for individuals infected with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in Hong Kong in 2003.

survivors, non-survivors were older (64·6 years [11·2] vs 51·9 years [12·9]), more likely to develop ARDS (26 [81%] patients vs 9 [45%] patients), and more likely to receive mechanical ventilation (30 [94%] patients vs 7 [35%] patients), either invasively or non-invasively.\n\n Most patients had organ function damage, including 35 (67%) with ARDS, 15 (29%) with acute kidney injury, 12 (23%) with cardiac injury, 15 (29%) with liver dysfunction, and one (2%) with pneumothorax.\n\n 37 (71%) patients required mechanical ventilation.\n\n Hospital-acquired infection occurred in seven (13·5%) patients.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe mortality of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia is considerable.\n\n The survival time of the non-survivors is likely to be within 1–2 weeks after ICU admission.\n\n Older patients (&gt;65 years) with comorbidities and ARDS are at increased risk of death.\n\n The severity of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia poses great strain on critical care resources in hospitals, especially if they are not adequately staffed or resourced.\n\n\nFunding\nNone.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7102538","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Elsevier

associated with in-hospital death of patients with COVID-19","abstract":"In December 2019, a coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) disease outbreak occurred in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, and rapidly spread to other areas worldwide.\n Although diffuse alveolar damage and acute respiratory failure were the main features, the involvement of other organs needs to be explored.\n Since information on kidney disease in patients with COVID-19 is limited, we determined the prevalence of acute kidney injury (AKI) in patients with COVID-19. Further, we evaluated the association between markers of abnormal kidney function and death in patients with COVID-19. This was a prospective cohort study of 701 patients with COVID-19 admitted in a tertiary teaching hospital that also encompassed three affiliates following this major outbreak in Wuhan in 2020 of whom 113 (16.1%) died in hospital.\n Median age of the patients was 63 years (interquartile range, 50-71), including 367 men and 334 women.\n On admission, 43.9% of patients had proteinuria and 26.7% had hematuria.\n The prevalence of elevated serum creatinine, elevated blood urea nitrogen and estimated glomerular filtration under 60 ml/min/1.73m2 were 14.4, 13.1 and 13.1%, respectively.\n During the study period, AKI occurred in 5.1% patients.\n Kaplan-Meier analysis demonstrated that patients with kidney disease had a significantly higher risk for in-hospital death.\n Cox proportional hazard regression confirmed that elevated baseline serum creatinine (hazard ratio: 2.10, 95% confidence interval: 1.36-3.26), elevated baseline blood urea nitrogen (3.97, 2.57-6.14), AKI stage 1 (1.90, 0.76-4.76), stage 2 (3.51, 1.49-8.26), stage 3 (4.38, 2.31-8.31), proteinuria 1+ (1.80, 0.81-4.00), 2+?3+ (4.84, 2.00-11.70), and hematuria 1+ (2.99, 1.39-6.42), 2+?3+ (5.56,2.58- 12.01) were independent risk factors for in-hospital death after adjusting for age, sex, disease severity, comorbidity and leukocyte count.\n Thus, our findings show the prevalence of kidney disease on admission and the development of AKI during hospitalization in patients with COVID-19 is high and is associated with in-hospital mortality.\n Hence, clinicians should increase their awareness of kidney disease in patients with severe COVID-19.","id":"PMC7110296","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"International Society of Nephrology.

The primary composite end point was admission to an intensive care unit (ICU), the use of mechanical ventilation, or death.\n\n\nResults\nThe median age of the patients was 47 years; 41.9% of the patients were female.\n\n The primary composite end point occurred in 67 patients (6.1%), including 5.0% who were admitted to the ICU, 2.3% who underwent invasive mechanical ventilation, and 1.4% who died.\n\n Only 1.9% of the patients had a history of direct contact with wildlife.\n\n Among nonresidents of Wuhan, 72.3% had contact with residents of Wuhan, including 31.3% who had visited the city.\n\n The most common symptoms were fever (43.8% on admission and 88.7% during hospitalization) and cough (67.8%).\n\n Diarrhea was uncommon (3.8%).\n\n The median incubation period was 4 days (interquartile range, 2 to 7).\n\n On admission, ground-glass opacity was the most common radiologic finding on chest computed tomography (CT) (56.4%).\n\n No radiographic or CT abnormality was found

was performed, with collecting data from medical records of confirmed COVID-19 patients in Zhejiang province from Jan 17 to Feb 12, 2020. Epidemiological, clinical and treatment data were analyzed between those older (?60y) and younger (&lt;60y) patients.\n\n\nResults\nTotal 788 patients with confirmed COVID-19 were selected, where 136 were older patients with corresponding age of 68.28y±7.314y.\n\n There was a significantly higher frequency of women in the older patients compared with the younger patients (57.35% vs 46.47%, P=0.021).\n\n The presence of coexisting medical condition was significantly higher in older patients compared with younger patients (55.15% vs 21.93%, P&lt;0.001), including the rate of hypertension, diabetes, heart diseases and COPD.\n\n Significantly higher rates of severe (older vs younger groups: 16.18% vs 5.98%, P&lt;0.001)/critical (8.82% vs 0.77%, P&lt;0.001) type, shortness of breath (12.50% vs 3.07%, P&lt;0.001) and high temperature of &gt;39.0?

Patient with confirmed MERS-CoV infection were not clinically distinguishable from those with negative MERS-CoV RT-PCR results although diarrhoea was commoner in MERS patients.\n A high level of

Male sex was more predominant in deceased patients (83; 73%) than in recovered patients (88; 55%). Chronic hypertension and other cardiovascular comorbidities were more frequent among deceased patients (54 (48%) and 16 (14%)) than recovered patients (39 (24%) and 7 (4%)).

Acute respiratory distress syndrome and respiratory failure, sepsis, acute cardiac injury, and heart failure were the most common critical complications during exacerbation of covid-19.\nIntroduction\nCoronaviruses are important pathogens of humans and animals that can cause diseases ranging from the common cold to more severe and even fatal respiratory infections. In the past two decades two highly pathogenic human coronaviruses, the coronavirus responsible for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-Cov) and the coronavirus responsible for Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-Cov),  have emerged in two separate events. They induced lower respiratory tract infection as well as extrapulmonary manifestations, leading to hundreds or thousands of cases with high mortality rates of up to 50% in certain populations. In December 2019 a new strain of coronavirus, officially named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-Cov-2), was first isolated from three patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention,  connected to the cluster of acute respiratory illness cases from Wuhan, China. Recent epidemiological reports have provided evidence for person to person transmission of the SARS-Cov-2 in family and hospital settings.  As of 28 February 2020, the number of patients infected with SARS-Cov-2 has exceeded 83 652 globally, and more than 2858 have now died of covid-19, with the highest mortality rate of 4.47% in Wuhan. On 30 January 2020, the World Health Organization declared that the outbreak of SARS-Cov-2 constituted a public health emergency of international concern.\nEvidence indicates that substantial similarities exist between severe acute respiratory syndrome and covid-19. A recent study reported a 79.5% genome sequence identity between SARS-Cov-2 and SARS-Cov, and SARS-Cov-2 was 96% identical in terms of whole genome sequence to a bat coronavirus. Clinical and pathological features of patients with covid-19 have recently been reported, showing that the SARS-Cov-2 infection causes clusters of severe and even fatal pneumonia with clinical presentation greatly resembling that of SARS-Cov infection, associated with admission to intensive care units and high mortality. The first study of the initial 41 laboratory confirmed cases with covid-19 showed that 28 (68%) of 41 patients had been discharged and six (15%) had died. A larger case series involving 138 consecutive patients admitted to hospital with covid-19 showed that 47 (34%) patients were discharged and six died (overall mortality 4.3%). Demographic, clinical, laboratory, and radiological differences between patients who were and were not admitted to the intensive care unit have been fully evaluated. Given that the numbers of patients in these studies is relatively small, information about the clinical characteristics of patients who died is scarce. No vaccine or specific antiviral treatment for covid-19 has yet been shown to be effective, so supportive therapy that eases the symptoms and protects multi-organ function may be beneficial. Identifying or more promptly treating patients in high risk groups is crucial to decrease the mortality rate.\nIn this study, we did a comprehensive evaluation of deceased patients and patients recovered among those with confirmed covid-19 who were previously transferred or admitted to the isolation ward of Wuhan Tongji Hospital, which is one of the designated hospitals assigned by Chinese government for patients severely or critically ill with covid-19. We aimed to compare the demographic, clinical, laboratory, and radiological features of patients with different clinical outcomes.\nMethods\nStudy participants and data collection\nFrom 13 January to 12 February 2020, 799 moderately to severely ill or critically ill patients with confirmed covid-19 were transferred from other hospitals or isolation sites or admitted from fever clinics to Tongji Hospital. Tongji Hospital was urgently reconstructed and has been assigned by Chinese government as a designed hospital for severely or critically ill patients with covid-19. As of 28 February 2020, 113 of the 799 patients had died, with a mortality rate of up to 14.1%, and 161 patients had recovered and been discharged. The remaining 525 patients were still in hospital and receiving medical care. All patients were diagnosed as having covid-19 and classified as being moderately, severely, or critically ill according to the Guidance for Corona Virus Disease 2019 (6th edition) released by the National Health Commission of China. All the recovered patients with covid-19 had completely resolved symptoms and signs, had significant improvement in pulmonary and extrapulmonary organ dysfunction, and no longer needed supportive care, with confirmed viral clearance by repeated tests for SARS-Cov-2 before hospital discharge. Written informed consent was waived owing to the rapid emergence of this infectious disease.\nWe obtained epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics, as well as treatment and outcome data, from electronic medical records for deceased patients and recovered patients by using data collection forms. We collected data on demographics, medical history, exposure history, underlying chronic diseases, symptoms and signs, laboratory findings, computed tomographic scans of the chest, and treatment (including antiviral therapy, antibiotics, corticosteroid therapy, and oxygen support) during the hospital admission. The clinical data were monitored up to 28 February 2020. The research team of experienced clinicians from Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology analysed patients' medical records. A trained team of physicians and researchers independently entered and cross checked data in a computerised database. If the core data were missing, we sent requests for clarification to the coordinators, who subsequently contacted the clinicians responsible for the treatment of the patients. As some patients presented with various forms of disorder of consciousness on admission, we obtained data on their medical histories and pre-admission information through contact with their close relatives and by accessing medical records from previous hospital visits.\nThe supplementary table shows the criteria and definitions for the diagnosis, clinical classification (mild, moderate, severe, and critically ill), and complications (acute respiratory distress syndrome, acute kidney injury, sepsis, shock, acute liver injury, acute heart failure, and cardiac injury)    for covid-19.\nLaboratory measurements\nReal time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction assay for SARS-Cov-2\nThroat swab samples were collected for extracting SARS-Cov-2 RNA from patients. The respiratory sample RNA isolation kit (Biogerm, Shanghai, China) was used to extract total RNA within two hours. Briefly, 40 muL of cell lysates were transferred into a collection tube followed by vortex for 10 seconds. After standing at room temperature for 10 minutes, the collection tube was centrifuged at 1000 revolutions per minute for five minutes. The suspension was used for real time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay of SARS-Cov-2 RNA. Two target genes:open reading frame 1ab (ORF1ab) and nucleocapsid protein (N):were simultaneously amplified and tested during the real time RT-PCR assay. Target 1 (ORF1ab) comprised forward primer CCCTGTGGGTTTTACACTTAA, reverse primer ACGATTGTGCATCAGCTGA, and the probe 5'-VIC-CCGTCTGCGGTATGTGGAAAGGTTATGG-BHQ1-3'. Target 2 (N) comprised forward primer GGGGAACTTCTCCTGCTAGAAT, reverse primer CAGACATTTTGCTCTCAAGCTG, and the probe 5'-FAM- TTGCTGCTGCTTGACAGATT-TAMRA-3'. The real time RT-PCR assay was conducted using a SARS-Cov-2 nucleic acid detection kit according to the manufacturer's protocol (Shanghai Bio-germ Medical Technology company). The reaction mixture contains 12 muL of reaction buffer, 4 muL of enzyme solution, 4 muL of Probe primers solution, 3 muL of diethyl pyrocarbonate treated water, and 2 muL of RNA template. The RT-PCR assay was conducted under the following conditions: incubation at 50 C for 15 minutes and 95 C for five minutes, 40 cycles of denaturation at 94 C for 15 seconds, and extending and collecting fluorescence signal at 55 C for 45 seconds. A cycle threshold value less than 37 was defined as a positive test result, and a cycle threshold value of 40 or more was defined as a negative test. These diagnostic criteria were based on the recommendation by the National Institute for Viral Disease Control and Prevention (China) (http://ivdc.chinacdc.cn/kyjz/202001/t20200121_211337.html). A medium load, defined as a cycle threshold value of 37 to less than 40, required confirmation by retesting.\nClinical laboratory measurements\nInitial clinical laboratory investigation included a complete blood count, serum biochemical tests (including liver and kidney function, creatine kinase, lactate dehydrogenase, and electrolytes), a coagulation profile, and cytokine tests. Respiratory specimens, including nasal and pharyngeal swabs, or sputum were tested to exclude evidence of other viral infections, including influenza, respiratory syncytial virus, avian influenza, parainfluenza virus, and adenovirus.\nPrinciples of management of patients\nSupportive therapy\nVital signs and oxygen saturation should be monitored (every eight hours; patients with severe disease need continuous monitoring), supportive treatment strengthened, sufficient calories provided, and the stability of the internal environment, such as water, electrolyte, and acid-base balance, maintained. The intake and output volumes should be strictly balanced, especially in critical ill patients.\nOxygen therapy\nSupplemental oxygen therapy should be given immediately to patients with hypoxaemia. Oxygen therapy can be started at a flow rate of 5 L/min, and the target oxygen saturation is pulse oxygen saturation &gt;=90% in non-pregnant adult patients, &gt;=92-95% in pregnant patients, and &gt;=94% in patients who are critically ill with severe respiratory distress, shock, or coma.\nIf standard oxygen therapy fails, mechanical ventilation should be considered; high flow nasal catheter oxygen or non-invasive ventilation (for example, bilevel positive airway pressure mode) can be used. If no improvement is seen within one hour of non-invasive mechanical ventilation, invasive mechanical ventilation should be used. Experienced experts can recommend extracorporeal membrane pulmonary oxygenation according to their evaluation of the patient's situation.\nEmpirical antimicrobial therapy\nIf a history of seasonal or local influenza epidemiology exists, empirical therapy may be considered.\nBlood purification therapy\nContinuous renal replacement therapy can be used in critically ill patients.\nStatistical analysis\nWe present categorical variables as numbers and percentages and continuous variables as mean and standard deviation if they were normally distributed or median and interquartile range if they were not. We compared means for continuous variables by using independent group t tests when the data were normally distributed; otherwise, we used the Mann-Whitney test. We compared proportions for categorical variables by using the chi2 test. We used Fisher's exact test in the analysis of contingency tables when the sample sizes were small. For unadjusted comparisons, we considered a two sided P value below 0.05 to be statistically significant. We used SPSS (version 19.0) for all analyses.\nPatient and public involvement\nThis was a retrospective case series study, and no patients were involved in the study design or in setting the research questions or the outcome measures directly. No patients were asked to advise on interpretation or writing up of results.\nResults\nDemographics and baseline characteristics of deceased patients and recovered patients\nFrom 13 January to 12 February 2020, 799 moderately to severely ill or critically ill patients with confirmed covid-19 were transferred or admitted to Tongji Hospital. As of 28 February 2020, 113 of these patients had died of covid-19 and 161 patients had fully recovered and been discharged. As shown in table 1, the median age of deceased patients was 68 (interquartile range 62.0-77.0) years, which was significantly older than recovered patients (51 (37.0-66.0) years); 94 (83%) deceased patients and 59 (37%) who recovered were aged 60 or older. Male sex was more predominant in deceased patients (83; 73%) than in recovered patients (88; 55%). Overall, 71 (63%) patients who died and 62 (39%) who recovered had at least one chronic medical condition. Hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and cerebrovascular disease were much more frequent among deceased patients (54 (48%), 16 (14%), and 4 (4%)) than among recovered patients (39 (24%), 7 (4%), and 0 (0%)). Few patients had a current or former cigarette smoking history of at least 30 pack years. The proportion of healthcare workers among deceased patients (1; 1%) was significantly lower than among recovered patients (18; 11%). Likewise, the proportion of patients with a history of close contact with previously confirmed patients tended to be lower in deceased patients (44; 12%) than in recovered patients (33; 20%).\nPresenting characteristics of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 who died and recovered patients.

Other prevalent symptoms at onset of illness in deceased patients included fatigue, dyspnoea, chest tightness, and sputum production; less common symptoms included anorexia, diarrhoea, and myalgia. Dyspnoea and chest tightness were much more common in deceased patients (70 (62%) and 55 (49%)) than in recovered patients (50 (31%) and 48 (30%)). Twenty five (22%) people who died and only one (1%) who recovered had disorders of consciousness on hospital admission. Nine deceased patients and 16 who recovered had no fever, with fatigue, cough, dyspnoea, myalgia, or diarrhoea as the initial symptoms. Among these, one patient with no symptoms who recovered was diagnosed as having covid-19 during routine physical examination, and another complained only of stinging eyes for two weeks before being admitted to hospital.\nAmong the deceased patients, the median time from onset of symptoms to hospital admission was 10.0 (interquartile range 7.0-13.0) days, which tended to be longer than for recovered patients (9.0 (6.0-12.0) days). The median time from onset of symptoms to death in deceased patients was 16 (12.0-20.0) days, and the median time from first symptoms to discharge in recovered patients was 26 (21.8-29.0) days. The median time from admission to death was 5 (3.0-9.3) days and the median time from admission to discharge was 16 (14.0-19.0) days.\nMeasures of vital signs were recorded on the day of hospital admission for all patients. Median systolic blood pressure was significantly higher in deceased patients (137.0 mm Hg) than recovered patients (125.0 mm Hg). More patients who died than who recovered had arterial pressure of 140 mm Hg or higher (50 (44%) v 33 (20%)). Heart rates were much higher in deceased patients (101.0 beats per minute) than in recovered patients (91.0 beats per minute). Respiratory rates were significantly higher in deceased patients (24.0 breaths per minute) than in recovered patients (20.0 breaths per minute). Deceased patients more often developed tachycardia and tachypnoea (respiratory rate &gt;=24 breaths per minute) (56 (50%) and 66 (58%)) than did recovered patients (48 (30%) and 22 (14%)). Seventy two (64%) deceased patients and only 19 (12%) who recovered had percutaneous oxygen saturation of 93% or below on admission.\nLaboratory parameters of deceased patients and recovered patients\nWe observed substantial differences in laboratory findings between patients who died of covid-19 and those who recovered from it (table 2). Fifty six (50%) deceased patients and only six (4%) who recovered developed leukocytosis (white blood cell count &gt;=10x109/L). Deceased patients had persistent and more severe lymphopenia than recovered patients; 44 (39%) deceased patients and eight (5%) recovered patients had lymphocyte counts below 0.5x109/L. Median platelet counts were significantly lower in deceased patients.\nLaboratory findings on admission of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 who died and recovered patients.

and gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase were markedly higher in deceased patients than in recovered patients. Fifty nine (52%) deceased patients and 25 (16%) who recovered had abnormal aspartate aminotransferase concentrations (&gt;40 U/L). Albumin concentrations were significantly lower in deceased patients than in recovered patients. Seventy four (65%) deceased patients and 22 (14%) recovered patients developed hypoalbuminaemia (albumin &lt;32 g/L). Concentrations of blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, potassium, triglycerides, creatine kinase, and lactate dehydrogenase were significantly higher in deceased patients than in recovered patients. Concentrations of hypersensitive cardiac troponin I and N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide were markedly higher in deceased patients (40.8 pg/mL and 800.0 pg/mL) than in recovered patients (3.3 pg/mL and 72.0 pg/mL), with eight deceased patients having cardiac troponin I above 1000 pg/mL and two above 10 000 pg/mL. In addition, deceased patients more often had increased cardiac troponin I and N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide concentrations (68/94 (72%) and 68/80 (85%)) than did recovered patients (15/109 (14%) and 17/93 (18%)).\nMedian prothrombin time was significantly longer in deceased patients than in recovered patients, whereas activated partial thromboplastin time was comparable between the two groups. D-dimer concentrations were markedly greater in deceased patients (4.6 mug/mL) than in recovered patients (0.6 mug/mL). Thirty four (35%) of 97 deceased patients and only three (2%) of 150 recovered patients had D-dimer concentrations above 21mug/mL. Concentrations of procalcitonin, high sensitivity C-reactive protein, and ferritin, as well as erythrocyte sedimentation rate, were significantly higher in deceased patients than in recovered patients. Thirty five (36%) of 96 deceased patients and three (2%) of 140 recovered patients had procalcitonin of 0.5 ng/mL or higher. Thyroid stimulating hormone and free triiodothyronine concentrations were significantly lower in deceased patients (0.7 mIU/mL and 2.8 pmol/L) than in recovered patients (1.4 mIU/mL and 4.3 pmol/L). Serum circulating immunoglobulin A, immunoglobulin G, and immunoglobulin M did not differ significantly between the two groups, whereas complement 3 and complement 4 concentrations were markedly lower in deceased patients than in recovered patients.\nOf patients with available data, concentrations of interleukin 2 receptor, interleukin 6, interleukin 8, interleukin 10, and tumour necrosis factor alpha were significantly higher in deceased patients than in recovered patients. Deceased patients more often had increased concentrations of interleukin 2 receptor, interleukin 6, interleukin 8, interleukin 10, and tumour necrosis factor alpha than did recovered patients. Most (48/53; 91%) deceased patients had undetectable concentrations of interleukin 1beta. Forty two (86%) of 49 deceased patients and 58 (50%) of 117 recovered patients had proteinuria, and 40 (82%) of 49 deceased patients and 44 (38%) of 117 recovered patients showed microscopic haematuria.\nOn admission, abnormalities on chest radiographs were seen in all patients (fig 1); 113 (100%) deceased patients and 152 (94%) recovered patients had bilateral involvement on chest radiographs. Typical findings on chest computed tomography images on admission of deceased patients showed bilateral ground glass opacity and subsegmental areas of consolidation (fig 1, A and C), which then progressed rapidly with mass shadows of high density in both lungs (fig 1, B and D). Representative chest computed tomography images of recovered patients showed right middle lobe and lower lobe ground glass opacity and consolidation (fig 1, E and F); then bilateral ground glass opacity and bilateral consolidation of the lungs progressed but right middle lobe consolidation resolved (fig 1, G). Follow-up images showed obviously resolved bilateral ground glass opacity and consolidation (fig 1, H).\nRepresentative chest computed tomographic images of patients with covid-19 who died and patients who recovered. A-D are chest computed tomograms showing axial view lung window from two deceased patients. Case 1 was a 57 year old women, and case 2 was a 53 year old man. E-H are chest computed tomograms images from a 33 year old woman who recovered. A: image obtained on day 10 after symptom onset shows multiple ground glass opacities and consolidation in bilateral lungs. B: image obtained on day 18 after symptom onset shows progressive multiple ground glass opacities and consolidation in bilateral lungs. C: image obtained on day 9 after symptom onset shows multiple ground glass opacities in bilateral lungs and solid nodule in right lower lobe. D: image obtained on day 13 after symptom onset shows progressive ground glass opacities in bilateral lungs and decreased density of solid nodule in right lower lobe. E: image obtained on day 4 after symptom onset shows right middle lobe and lower lobe consolidation and ground glass opacities. F: image obtained on day 7 after symptom onset shows progressive right middle lobe and lower lobe consolidation and ground glass opacities. G: image obtained on day 11 after symptom onset shows progressive multiple ground glass opacities and consolidation in bilateral lungs and decreased density and range of right middle lobe consolidation. H: after 17 days' therapy, follow-up computed tomograms show ground glass opacities, and consolidation are obviously resolved in bilateral lungs\nArterial blood gases were measured in 35 deceased patients and 32 recovered patients (table 3). Five (14%) deceased patients and 3 (9%) recovered patients had pH below 7.35, whereas 14 (40%) deceased patients and five (16%) recovered patients had pH 7.45 or above. The median arterial partial pressure of oxygen in deceased patients was 59.2 mm Hg, which was significantly lower than that of recovered patients (121.0 mm Hg). Eighteen of 35 deceased patients and none who recovered had arterial partial pressure of oxygen below 60 mmHg, and all of these had partial pressure of carbon dioxide below 50 mmHg, indicating that they had type I respiratory failure. The median arterial partial pressure of oxygen to fraction of inspired oxygen ratio was significantly lower in deceased patients (105.1) than in recovered patients (350.0). Moreover, all the deceased patients and 14 (44%) recovered patients had an arterial partial pressure of oxygen to fraction of inspired oxygen ratio of 300, indicating that these patients had developed acute respiratory distress syndrome, whereas severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (&lt;=100) developed only in deceased patients (16; 46%). Actual bicarbonate and total carbon dioxide concentration were markedly lower in deceased patients than in recovered patients.\nBlood gas analysis of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 who died and recovered patients.

Common complications observed in deceased patients included acute respiratory distress syndrome (113; 100%), type I respiratory failure (18/35; 51%), sepsis (113; 100%), acute cardiac injury (72/94; 77%), heart failure (41/83; 49%), shock (46; 41%), alkalosis (14/35; 40%), hyperkalaemia (42; 37%), acute kidney injury (28; 25%), and hypoxic encephalopathy (23; 20%). These were significantly more frequent than in recovered patients, showing their potential association with the clinical outcome. Less common complications in deceased patients included acidosis, disseminated intravascular coagulation, and acute liver injury. One patient who died developed gastrointestinal bleeding. Patients with cardiovascular comorbidities were more likely to develop acute cardiac injury and heart failure. In addition, although more deceased patients had chronic hypertension, among patients with available data regardless of history of coexisting cardiovascular disease, cardiac complications were more frequent in deceased patients than in recovered patients.\nComplications and treatments of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 who died and recovered patients.

One hundred and five (93%) deceased patients and 144 (89%) who recovered received empirical antibacterial therapy (moxifloxacin, cefoperazone, or azithromycin). Forty four (39%) deceased patients and 59 (37%) who recovered received intravenous immunoglobulin therapy. Fewer deceased patients (25; 22%) than recovered patients (64; 40%) received interferon alpha inhalation treatment. Significantly more deceased patients (93; 82%) than recovered patients (26; 16%) received mechanical ventilation. Invasive mechanical ventilation was needed in 17 (15%) deceased patients, one of whom received extracorporeal membrane pulmonary oxygenation as rescue therapy. Three deceased patients received continuous renal replacement therapy.\nDiscussion\nOur study comprehensively described the major differences in clinical features between the patients who died of covid-19 and those who recovered from it. The median age of deceased patients was significantly older than that of recovered patients. Male sex was more predominant in patients who died than in those who recovered. Chronic hypertension and other cardiovascular comorbidities were more frequent among deceased patients than recovered patients. Symptoms related to hypoxemia were more common in deceased patients than in recovered patients. Deceased patients more often developed systematic inflammation and multi-organ dysfunction than did recovered patients. The indicators of cardiac injury showed more frequent or prominent abnormalities in deceased patients than in recovered patients. The information provided will further enrich knowledge about this critical disease and may consequently help to improve patients' outcomes and lower the fatality rate.\nComparison with other studies\nThe clinical spectrum of covid-19 varies widely, ranging from an asymptomatic infection to severe and critical pneumonia with high fatality rates. The Chinese Centers for Disease Control recently reported that most of the confirmed cases were classified as mild or moderate, 13.8% as severe, and only 4.7% as critically ill. The overall fatality rate for confirmed covid-19 cases was found to be higher in male than in female patients, with the risk of death rising with age for both sexes. The highest fatality rate was in people aged 80 and above.\nThe overall mortality rate of covid-19 is much lower than for severe acute respiratory syndrome (10%) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (30%).  However, covid-19 has ultimately proven more deadly as it has spread to many more people globally than did the others, owing to rapid person to person transmission and atypical symptoms at an early stage in certain patients.  Here, we report a relatively high mortality rate for covid-19 of up to 14.1%, which is higher than in recent reports. This is partly due to a large proportion of severely or critically ill patients admitted to Tongji Hospital, one of the designated hospitals for severe covid-19, and to the medical resource limitations at the beginning of the covid-19 outbreak. These resources were improved by early February, with prompt supply of medics and medical necessities from across the nation to Wuhan. \nIn accordance with the recent reports on characteristics of patients with covid-19 who needed management in intensive care units,   advanced age (&gt;60), male sex, and comorbidities (particularly hypertension) are believed to be risk factors for severe disease and death from SARS-Cov-2 infection. Thus, early vigilant monitoring along with high quality supportive care are needed in patients at high risk. It is notable that healthcare workers as well as close contacts of previously confirmed patients were likely to have a good outcome, which is consistent with the relatively low fatality rate (0.3%) reported in healthcare workers. This could be explained by the fact that in our study the median age of the healthcare workers was much younger than that of the remaining patients (data not shown). It could also be partly due to the lower mortality observed in the second generation of SARS-Cov-2 infection, as well as to the early awareness of potential infection in that scenario meaning that people would seek medical care or start treatment promptly. Furthermore, the time from onset of symptoms to hospital admission was longer in deceased patients, as some of them had been in a critical condition before being transferred from other healthcare units to Tongji Hospital. This highlights the need to develop community awareness about prompt seeking of medical care and earlier referral to the intensive care unit for high risk populations.\nThe incidence of symptoms including fever, cough, fatigue, anorexia, myalgia, and diarrhoea did not differ significantly between deceased patients and recovered patients, whereas dyspnoea, chest tightness, and disorders of consciousness were more common in those who died. Moreover, the vital signs data showed that most deceased patients had tachycardia and/or tachypnoea as well as pulse oxygen saturation of 93% or lower. These signs and symptoms indicated that most deceased patients had been in a severe or critical condition on admission, and the onset of certain symptoms may help physicians to identify the patients at risk of a poor outcome.\nThe differences in abnormalities of laboratory findings between the deceased patients and the survivors were substantial. Most of the deceased patients and only a few recovered patients developed leukocytosis, and one third of deceased patients and only few who recovered had procalcitonin above 0.5 ng/mL, indicating that a large proportion of deceased patients might have had secondary bacterial infection, which could be strongly associated with death. Deceased patients had persistent and more severe lymphopenia compared with recovered patients, suggesting that a cellular immune deficiency state was associated with poor prognosis. In addition, other common laboratory abnormalities in deceased patients included coagulation disorder (elevation of prothrombin time and D-dimer), impaired liver and kidney function (mild or moderate elevation of alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, total bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase, blood urea nitrogen, and creatinine and frequent hypoalbuminaemia, haematuria, and albuminuria), electrolyte disturbance (hyperkalaemia and hypernatraemia), elevated inflammatory markers (high sensitivity C-reactive protein, ferritin, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate), and cytokine storm. Most notably, markedly higher concentrations of creatine kinase, lactate dehydrogenase, cardiac troponin I, and N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide were seen in deceased patients than in recovered patients. Increase in cardiac troponin I and N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide was much more frequent and significant than that in the recent reports,  likely owing to the relatively small number of deceased patients and more patients at earlier stages of the disease included in those studies.\nIn the later stages of the disease, patients who die may develop pulmonary and extrapulmonary organ damage, including acute respiratory distress syndrome, type I respiratory failure, sepsis, acute cardiac injury, heart failure, acute kidney injury, hypoxic encephalopathy, shock, acidosis or alkalosis, disseminated intravascular coagulation, and acute liver injury, although the last two complications were less frequent. Development of respiratory, cardiac, and neurological complications is strongly associated with poor outcome in patients with covid-19. Patients with cardiovascular comorbidities were more likely to develop cardiac complications. Cardiac complications were frequent not only in deceased patients with cardiovascular comorbidities but also in those without cardiovascular comorbidities, suggesting that the high risk of cardiac complications in deceased patients could not be entirely ascribed to coexisting cardiovascular disease. Furthermore, in addition to acute respiratory distress syndrome and respiratory failure, acute cardiac injury and heart failure could be major factors contributing to the fatality risk of covid-19 regardless of history of previous cardiovascular disease. However, the pathological report of covid-19 associated with acute respiratory distress syndrome at present shows that pulmonary oedema with hyaline membrane formation in the lungs, but no obvious histological changes in heart tissue, was identified from one single case report. This suggests that the underlying mechanism of cardiac injury needs further exploration. The median time from onset of symptoms to death in deceased patients was 16 days, and the median time from first symptoms to discharge in recovered patients was 26 days. In covid-19, the evolution of pulmonary and systemic inflammation in the first two weeks may determine the physiological progression (resolving or progressing) and outcome of disease (death or survival).\nTo date, no vaccine or specific antiviral treatment for covid-19 has proven to be effective, so supportive therapy that eases the symptoms and protects important organs may be most beneficial. In this study, for patients without second bacterial infection, empirical antimicrobial treatment seemed to be ineffective. Fewer deceased patients than recovered received antiviral monotherapy or combination antiviral therapy, as well as interferon alpha inhalation treatment. Considering the severe pneumonia and &quot;cytokine storm&quot; observed in deceased patients, more of these patients were given glucocorticoid therapy than recovered patients. Because of hypoxaemia, significantly more deceased patients than recovered received ventilation. We cannot conclude from this study which antivirals given at the right time would be beneficial, or whether steroid use would be beneficial, for patients with covid-19; further investigation is needed.\nSubstantial similarities exist between covid-19 and severe acute respiratory syndrome, from the virus homology to the potential origin, main transmission route (respiratory droplets), identified receptor (angiotensin converting enzyme 2), clinical manifestation, and disease dynamics. Risk factors for severe covid-19 or severe acute respiratory syndrome outcomes are old age and comorbidities. Progression for patients with severe disease follows a similar pattern for both viruses. Although both viruses can cause severe and even lethal lower respiratory tract infection and extrapulmonary manifestations, myocardial injury and heart failure are more frequently reported in patients with covid-19, indicating a unique pathophysiology. These findings will alert clinicians to pay special attention not only to the development of respiratory dysfunction but also to the signs of cardiac complications.\nLimitations of study\nOur study has several limitations. Firstly, almost all the deceased patients were classified as being severely or critically ill, whereas a large proportion of recovered patients might be classified as having moderate disease. This patient setting reflects the real world situation where most confirmed cases are mild or moderate. Nevertheless, the high incidence of cardiac complications in deceased patients is of great importance, raising awareness of the need for earlier monitoring and cardiac supportive care. Secondly, nearly a third of deceased patients developed disorders of consciousness on admission, ranging from somnolence to deep coma, which may result in a loss of some information (particularly a detailed history and subjective symptoms). Additionally, some laboratory tests (for example, cardiac troponin I, N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide, and arterial blood gas tests) were not done in all the patients, and missing data or important tests might lead to bias of clinical characteristics. Thirdly, the median length of hospital admission before death was about five days, information on the dynamic changes in laboratory variables in deceased patients was lacking, and the data collected for each patient on admission may have been from different disease stages. Therefore, further study is warranted to gain a better understanding of risk factors for and outcome of covid-19, which ultimately may help to guide efforts aimed at reducing the fatality rate.\nConclusions and policy implications\nCertain patients with covid-19, particularly those with advanced age and hypertension, were in a critical condition on admission and progressed rapidly to death within two to three weeks from disease onset. SARS-Cov-2 infection can cause both pulmonary and systemic inflammation, leading to multi-organ dysfunction in high risk populations. In addition to acute respiratory distress syndrome and type I respiratory failure, acute cardiac injury and heart failure may also contribute to the critical illness state associated with high mortality, which highlights the importance of earlier cardiac monitoring and supportive care in such patients.\nWhat is already known on this topic\nAs of 28 February 2020, more than 2858 people had died of coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19), with the highest mortality rate of 4.5% in Wuhan, China\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-Cov-2) infection causes clusters of severe and even fatal pneumonia\nClinical characteristics of patients with covid-19 who died have not been fully elucidated yet\nWhat this study adds\nCertain patients with covid-19, particularly those with advanced age and hypertension, were in a critical condition on admission and progressed rapidly to death within two to three weeks from disease onset\nSARS-Cov-2 infection can cause both pulmonary and systemic inflammation, leading to multi-organ dysfunction in high risk populations\nIn addition to acute respiratory distress syndrome and type I respiratory failure, acute cardiac injury and heart failure may also contribute to the critical illness state associated with high mortality\nExtra material supplied by authors\nContributors: TC, DW, HLC, WMY, DLY, and GC contributed equally to this paper, as did KM, DX, HJY, HWW, and TW.

others.\n Subsequently, in what became known as the 20/80 rule, a small percentage of individuals within any population was observed to control most transmission events.\n This empirical rule was shown to govern inter-individual transmission dynamics for many pathogens in several species, and individuals who infect disproportionately more secondary contacts, as compared to most others, became known as super-spreaders.\n Studies conducted in the wake of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) pandemic revealed that, in the absence of super-spreading events, most individuals infect few, if any, secondary contacts.\n The analysis of SARS transmission, and reports from other outbreaks, unveil a complex scenario in which super-spreading events are shaped by multiple factors, including co-infection with another pathogen, immune suppression, changes in airflow dynamics, delayed hospital admission, misdiagnosis, and inter-hospital transfers.\n Predicting and identifying super-spreaders open significant medical and public health challenges, and represent important facets of infectious disease management and pandemic preparedness

Evidence for Bats as the Evolutionary Source of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus","abstract":"The evolutionary origins of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus (MERS-CoV) are unknown.\n Current evidence suggests that insectivorous bats are likely to be the original source, as several 2c CoVs have been described from various species in the family Vespertilionidae.\n Here, we describe a MERS-like CoV identified from a Pipistrellus cf.\n hesperidus bat sampled in Uganda (strain PREDICT/PDF-2180), further supporting the hypothesis that bats are the evolutionary source of MERS-CoV.\n Phylogenetic analysis showed that PREDICT/PDF-2180 is closely related to MERS-CoV across much of its genome, consistent with a common ancestry; however, the spike protein was highly divergent (46% amino acid identity), suggesting that the two viruses may have different receptor binding properties.\n Indeed, several amino acid substitutions were identified in key binding residues that were predicted to block PREDICT/PDF-2180 from attaching to the MERS-CoV DPP4 receptor.\n To experimentally test this hypothesis, an infectious MERS-CoV clone expressing the PREDICT/PDF-2180 spike protein was generated.\n Recombinant viruses derived from the clone were replication competent but unable to spread and establish new infections in Vero cells or primary human airway epithelial cells.\n Our findings suggest that PREDICT/PDF-2180 is unlikely to pose a zoonotic threat.\n Recombination in the S1 subunit of the spike gene was identified as the primary mechanism driving variation in the spike phenotype and was likely one of the critical steps in the evolution and emergence of MERS-CoV in humans.\n","id":"PMC5380844","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"American

SARS-coronavirus (SARS-CoV) replication in the respiratory tract and are available in sufficient numbers for statistical evaluation.\n They are relatively inexpensive and easily accessible, but their use in SARS research is limited because they do not develop illness following infection.\n Older (12- to 14-mo-old) BALB/c mice develop clinical illness and pneumonitis, but they can be hard to procure, and immune senescence complicates pathogenesis studies.\n We adapted the SARS-CoV (Urbani strain) by serial passage in the respiratory tract of young BALB/c mice.\n Fifteen passages resulted in a virus (MA15) that is lethal for mice following intranasal inoculation.\n Lethality is preceded by rapid and high titer viral replication in lungs, viremia, and dissemination of virus to extrapulmonary sites accompanied by lymphopenia, neutrophilia, and pathological changes in the lungs.\n Abundant viral antigen is extensively distributed in bronchial epithelial cells and alveolar pneumocytes, and necrotic cellular debris is present in airways and alveoli, with only mild and focal pneumonitis.\n These observations suggest that mice infected with MA15 die from an overwhelming viral infection with extensive, virally mediated destruction of pneumocytes and ciliated epithelial cells.\n The MA15 virus has six coding mutations associated with adaptation and increased virulence; when introduced into a recombinant SARS-CoV, these mutations result in a highly virulent and lethal virus (rMA15), duplicating the phenotype of the biologically derived MA15 virus.\n Intranasal inoculation with MA15 reproduces many aspects of disease seen in severe human cases of SARS.\n The availability of the MA15 virus will enhance the use of the mouse model for SARS because infection with MA15 causes morbidity, mortality, and pulmonary pathology.\n This virus will be of value as a stringent challenge in evaluation of the efficacy of vaccines and antivirals.\n","id":"PMC1769406","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Public Library of

of MERS in South Korea.\n Deep-sequencing analysis of MERS-CoV genomes performed on specimens from eight patients revealed significant intrapatient variation; therefore, sequence heterogeneity was further analyzed using targeted deep sequencing.\n A total of 35 specimens from 24 patients (including a super-spreader) were sequenced to detect and analyze variants displaying intrapatient heterogeneity.\n Based on the analysis of non–consensus sequences, we demonstrated the intrapatient heterogeneity of MERS-CoVs, with the highest level in the super-spreader specimen.\n The heterogeneity could be transmitted in a close association with variation in the consensus sequences, suggesting the occurrence of multiple MERS-CoV infections.\n Analysis of intrapatient heterogeneity revealed a relationship between D510G and I529T mutations in the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the viral spike glycoprotein.\n These two mutations have been reported to reduce the affinity of the RBD for human CD26. Notably, although the frequency of both D510G and I529T varied greatly among specimens, the combined frequency of the single mutants was consistently high (87.7% ± 1.9% on average).\n Concurrently, the frequency of occurrence of the wild type at the two positions was only 6.5% ± 1.7% on average, supporting the hypothesis that selection pressure exerted by the host immune response played a critical role in shaping genetic variants and their interaction in human MERS-CoVs during the outbreak.\n","id":"PMC5111008","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press","authors":[{"firstname":"Donghyun","surname":"Park","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Hee Jae","surname":"Huh","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yeon Jeong","surname":"Kim","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Yeon Jeong","surname":"Kim","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Dae-Soon","surname":"Son","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Dae-Soon","surname":"Son","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Hyo-Jeong","surname":"Jeon","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Eu-Hyun","surname":"Im","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Jong-Won","surname":"Kim","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Nam Yong","surname":"Lee","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Eun-Suk","surname":"Kang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Cheol In","surname":"Kang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Doo Ryeon","surname":"Chung","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jin-Hyun","surname":"Ahn","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Kyong Ran","surname":"Peck","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Sun Shim","surname":"Choi","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Yae-Jean","surname":"Kim","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Chang-Seok","surname":"Ki","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Woong-Yang","surname":"Park","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"}]}]},{"doi":"10.1056/NEJMoa2001316","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Early Transmission Dynamics in Wuhan, China, of Novel Coronavirus–Infected Pneumonia","abstract":"Background\nThe initial cases of novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV)–infected pneumonia (NCIP) occurred in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, in December 2019 and January 2020.

January 2020. We analyzed data on the first 425 confirmed cases in Wuhan to determine the epidemiologic characteristics of NCIP.\n\n\nMethods\nWe collected information on demographic characteristics, exposure history, and illness timelines of laboratory-confirmed cases of NCIP that had been reported by January 22, 2020. We described characteristics of the cases and estimated the key epidemiologic time-delay distributions.\n\n In the early period of exponential growth, we estimated the epidemic doubling time and the basic reproductive number.\n\n\nResults\nAmong the first 425 patients with confirmed NCIP, the median age was 59 years and 56% were male.\n\n The majority of cases (55%) with onset before January 1, 2020, were linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, as compared with 8.6% of the subsequent cases.\n\n The mean incubation period was 5.2 days (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.1 to 7.0), with the 95th percentile of the distribution at 12.5 days.\n\n In its early stages, the epidemic doubled in size every 7.4 days.\n\n With a mean serial interval of 7.5 days (95% CI, 5.3 to 19), the basic reproductive number was estimated to be 2.2 (95% CI, 1.4 to 3.9).\n\n\nConclusions\nOn the basis of this information, there is evidence that human-to-human transmission has occurred among close contacts since the middle of December 2019.

outcomes in patients with a number of different malignancies.\n\n The objective of this study was to assess the relationship between NLR and mortality in a population of adult critically ill patients.\n\n\nMethods\nWe performed an observational cohort study of unselected intensive care unit (ICU) patients based on records in a large clinical database.\n\n We computed individual patient NLR and categorized patients by quartile of this ratio.\n\n The association of NLR quartiles and 28-day mortality was assessed using multivariable logistic regression.\n\n Secondary outcomes included mortality in the ICU, in-hospital mortality and 1-year mortality.\n\n An a priori subgroup analysis of patients with versus without sepsis was performed to assess any differences in the relationship between the NLR and outcomes in these cohorts.\n\n\nResults\nA total of 5,056 patients were included.\n\n Their 28-day mortality rate was 19%.\n\n The median age of the cohort was 65 years, and 47% were female.\n\n The median NLR for the entire cohort was 8.9 (interquartile range, 4.99 to 16.21).\n\n Following multivariable adjustments, there was a stepwise increase in mortality with increasing quartiles of NLR (first quartile: reference category; second quartile odds ratio (OR) = 1.32; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.03 to 1.71; third quartile OR = 1.43; 95% CI, 1.12 to 1.83; 4th quartile OR = 1.71; 95% CI, 1.35 to 2.16).\n\n A similar stepwise relationship was identified in the subgroup of patients who presented without sepsis.\n\n The NLR was not associated with 28-day mortality in patients with sepsis.\n\n Increasing quartile of NLR was statistically significantly associated with secondary outcome.\n\n\nConclusion\nThe NLR is associated with outcomes in unselected critically ill patients.\n\n In patients with sepsis, there was no statistically significant relationship between NLR and mortality.\n\n Further investigation is required to increase understanding of the

Epidemiological investigations have suggested that the outbreak was associated with a seafood market in Wuhan.\n Here we study a single patient who was a worker at the market and who was admitted to the Central Hospital of Wuhan on 26 December 2019 while experiencing a severe respiratory syndrome that included fever, dizziness and a cough.\n Metagenomic RNA sequencing4 of a sample of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from the patient identified a new RNA virus strain from the family Coronaviridae, which is designated here ‘WH-Human 1’ coronavirus (and has also been referred to as ‘2019-nCoV’).\n Phylogenetic analysis of the complete viral genome (29,903 nucleotides) revealed that the virus was most closely related (89.1% nucleotide similarity) to a group of SARS-like

presenting between 12 January 2020 to 6 February 2020. Patients with severe respiratory distress and/ or oxygen requirement at any time during the disease course were excluded.\n\n Repeat Chest CT was obtained at approximately 4 day intervals.\n\n The total CT score was the sum of lung involvement (5 lobes, score 1-5 for each lobe, range, 0 none, 25 maximum) was determined.\n\n\nResults\nTwenty one patients (6 males and 15 females, age 25-63 years) with confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia were evaluated.\n\n These patients under went a total of 82 pulmonary CT scans with a mean interval of 4±1 days (range: 1-8 days).\n\n All patients were discharged after a mean hospitalized period of 17±4 days (range: 11-26 days).\n\n Maximum lung involved peaked at approximately 10 days (with the calculated total CT score of 6) from the onset of initial symptoms (R2=0.25), p&lt;0.001).\n\n Based on quartiles of patients from day 0 to day 26 involvement, 4 stages of lung CT were defined: Stage 1 (0-4 days): ground glass opacities (GGO) in 18/24 (75%) patients with the total CT score of 2±2; (2)Stage-2 (5-8d days): increased crazy-paving pattern 9/17 patients (53%) with a increase in total CT score (6±4, p=0.002); (3) Stage-3 (9-13days): consolidation 19/21 (91%) patients with the peak of total CT score (7±4); (4) Stage-4 (?14 days): gradual resolution of consolidation 15/20 (75%) patients with a decreased total CT score (6±4) without crazy-paving pattern.\n\n\nConclusion\nIn patients recovering from COVID-19 pneumonia (without severe respiratory distress during the disease course), lung abnormalities on chest CT showed greatest severity approximately 10 days after initial onset of symptoms.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7233367","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Radiological Society of North America","authors":[{"firstname":"Feng","surname":"Pan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Tianhe","surname":"Ye","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Tianhe","surname":"Ye","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Peng","surname":"Sun","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Peng","surname":"Sun","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Shan","surname":"Gui","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Shan","surname":"Gui","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Bo","surname":"Liang","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Bo","surname":"Liang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lingli","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Lingli","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Dandan","surname":"Zheng","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Dandan","surname":"Zheng","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jiazheng","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Jiazheng","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Richard L.","surname":"Hesketh","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Richard L.","surname":"Hesketh","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lian","surname":"Yang","email":"yanglian@hust.edu.cn","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Lian","surname":"Yang","email":"yanglian@hust.edu.cn","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Chuansheng","surname":"Zheng","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Chuansheng","surname":"Zheng","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1093/jtm/taaa020","date":"2020-02-10","title":"Isolation, quarantine, social distancing and community containment: pivotal role for old-style public health measures in the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) outbreak","abstract":"Public health measures were decisive in controlling the SARS epidemic in 2003.

in confined spaces with relative homogeneous mixing.\n\n On 3 February, 2020, an outbreak of COVID-19 on cruise ship Diamond Princess was reported with 10 initial cases, following an index case on board around 21-25th January.\n\n By 4th February, public health measures such as removal and isolation of ill passengers and quarantine of non-ill passengers were implemented.\n\n By 20th February, 619 of 3700 passengers and crew (17%) were tested positive.\n\n\nMethods\nWe estimated the basic reproduction number from the initial period of the outbreak using SEIR models.\n\n We calibrated the models with transient functions of countermeasures to incidence data.\n\n We additionally estimated a counterfactual scenario in absence of countermeasures, and established a model stratified by crew and guests to study the impact of differential contact rates among the groups.\n\n We also compared scenarios of an earlier versus later evacuation of the ship.\n\n\nResults\nThe basic reproduction rate was initially 4 times higher on-board compared to the \documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\usepackage{amsmath}\n\usepackage{wasysym} \n\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\usepackage{amssymb}
