Current nursing home COVID-19 screening guidance includes assessment for fever, defined as a temperature of at least 38.0 C. The objective of this study was to describe the temperature changes before and after universal testing for SARS-CoV-2 in nursing home residents.\nDesign\nCohort study.\nSetting and Participants\nThe Veterans Administration (VA) operates 134 Community Living Centers (CLC), similar to nursing homes, that house residents who cannot live independently. VA guidance to CLCs directed daily clinical screening for COVID-19 that included temperature assessment.\nMeasures\nAll CLC residents (n = 7325) underwent SARS-CoV-2 testing. We report the temperature in the window of 14 days before and after universal SARS-CoV-2 testing among CLC residents. Baseline temperature was calculated for 5 days before the study window.\nResults\nSARS-CoV-2 was identified in 443 (6.0%) residents. The average maximum temperature in SARS-CoV-2-positive residents was 37.66 (0.69) compared with 37.11 (0.36) (P = .001) in SARS-CoV-2-negative residents. Temperatures in those with SARS-CoV-2 began rising 7 days before testing and remained elevated during the 14-day follow-up. Among SARS-CoV-2-positive residents, only 26.6% (n = 118) met the fever threshold of 38.0 C during the survey period. Most residents (62.5%, n = 277) with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 did experience 2 or more 0.5 C elevations above their baseline values. One cohort of SARS-CoV-2 residents' (20.3%, n = 90) temperatures never deviated &gt;0.5 C from baseline.\nConclusions and Implications\nA single screening for temperature is unlikely to detect nursing home residents with SARS-CoV-2. Repeated temperature measurement with a patient-derived baseline can increase sensitivity. The current fever threshold as a screening criteria for SARS-CoV-2 infection should be reconsidered.\nOlder people with chronic illness are at greatest risk for severe COVID-19 outcomes. In early March 2020, 34 (33.7%) of 101 SARS-CoV-2-infected residents died in a 130-bed Washington State King County nursing home facility; overall mortality was 18%. A total of 50 of 170 health care personnel were infected, along with 16 visitors. These findings led to aggressive monitoring to detect disease, and to efforts to reduce transmission by keeping visitors and symptomatic staff out of the building, while isolating residents in whom COVID-19 was suspected or confirmed. However, of 76 residents with SARS-CoV-2 laboratory-confirmed infection, 57% were asymptomatic, suggesting that symptomatic monitoring will fail to provide timely disease detection and undermine effective outbreak control.\nBecause threshold symptoms and signs, such as a temperature of at least 38.0 C, have been used to determine who is tested, their frequency may underestimate SARS-CoV-2 population prevalence. Standard screening processes now routinely screen for COVID-19 by assessing for temperature &gt;38.0 C. From the King County experience,   &quot;fever&quot; is limited as a screening criterion for COVID-19 in nursing facilities. Although the utility of fever as an indicator has been debated for older adults,   studies have reported that nursing home residents with pneumonia often present without fever   and have a lower basal temperature than community-dwelling older adults. The &quot;older and colder&quot; adage for nursing home residents may have statistical validity but poses challenges in guiding nursing facilities about fever during a pandemic.\nAlthough COVID and pneumonia can elevate temperature from within an individual's usual range, an absolute, universal cutoff for fever may miss potentially important temperature perturbations. With infection control practices presently dependent on a threshold temperature criterion to determine fever, we need to better understand the value and limitations such a threshold adds to identifying people infected with SARS-CoV-2 or appropriate actions for additional screening, especially in a nursing home context. We hypothesized that most residents of Veterans Administration Community Life Centers (CLCs) infected with SARS-CoV-2 do have temperature elevations well ahead of a confirmatory test, but also that peak temperatures will not typically meet the current screening criterion threshold of 38 C that follows the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) guidance.   \nMethods\nThis study was approved by the Providence Veterans Administration Medical Center's Institutional Review Board.\nSetting and Context\nThe VA Healthcare System (VHA) owns and operates 134 CLCs, providing a nursing home environment that serves 8800 veterans on a daily basis. The recognition of COVID-19's emerging risk specific to veterans in CLCs drove a decision by the VHA to try to systematically identify, isolate, and care for CLC veterans with asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection or COVID-19. On March 10, 2020, the VHA issued isolation and temperature guidance to CLCs, including daily monitoring of temperature. On April 14, 2020, VHA guidance required 1-time universal SARS-CoV-2 testing of all CLC residents and staff. The purpose of this analysis was to compare temperature trends and identify maximum temperatures in nursing home residents 14 days before and after systematic testing for SARS-CoV-2 throughout VHA CLCs.\nCohort\nUsing VHA electronic records, we identified veterans residing in CLCs during the period of March 1, 2020 until May 4, 2020. Veterans who were not tested for COVID-19 were excluded, as were those tested before admission to the CLC. In addition, we excluded those who were symptomatically tested because of symptoms before universal testing. Demographic descriptors were collected from the electronic medical records.\nTemperature Measurement\nEach CLC uses standard equipment to measure temperature, and enters the reading into the electronic medical record. In most CLCs, temperature is uploaded directly to the electronic medical record from the vital signs machine. Based on CDC guidance, the fever threshold was established at 38.0  C.   For this analysis, we selected the first temperature after 4 am for analysis. We assessed temperatures in the 2 weeks before and after SARS-CoV-2 testing. To establish a baseline temperature for each resident, we calculated the mean of 5 temperatures before our window of interest.\nCOVID-19 Measurement\nWe identified SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing results from the VA's electronic medical records. The VHA developed a harmonized definition of SARS-CoV-2 test results, requiring a PCR test from a certified laboratory.\nStatistics\nThose with reverse-transcriptase PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and those without were compared graphically and statistically. Continuous variables were confirmed with a Student's t-test; categorical variables were compared with chi2. Missing temperature data are described in online Supplementary Material 1. Analyses were performed in R 3.6.1; plots were created with the ggplot2 package.\nRole of the Funder\nThe funder had no role in the design, data collection, analysis, interpretation, or writing of this study.\nResults\nBaseline Characteristics of Population\n	Mean (SD), n (%)	P value	 	SARS-CoV-2+	SARS-CoV-2-	 	N	443	6882		 	Age, y	76.3 (10.8)	74.2 (10.9)	&lt;.001	 	Sex				 	 Male	432 (97.5%)	6605 (96.0%)	.085	 	 Female	11 (2.5%)	277 (4.0%)		 	Race			.084	 	 White	286 (64.56%)	4724 (68.64%)		 	 Black	123 (27.77%)	1593 (23.15%)		 	 Other races	34 (7.67%)	565 (8.21%)		 	Comorbidities				 	 Obesity	101 (22.8%)	1913 (27.8%)	.026	 	 Hypertension	309 (69.8%)	4805 (69.8%)	1.00	 	 Heart failure	102 (23.0%)	1865 (27.1%)	.069	 	 Lung disease	142 (32.0%)	2525 (36.7%)	.056	 	 Diabetes	165 (37.2%)	2780 (40.4%)	.208	 	 Dementia	301 (68.0%)	4298 (62.4%)	.023	 	Temperature				 	 Maximum,*  C	37.66 (0.69)	37.11 (0.36)	&lt;.001	 	 Any fever*	118 (26.64%)	201 (2.92%)	&lt;.001	 	Baseline temperature,  C				 	 Average 	36.59 (0.21)	36.56 (0.24)	.001	 	\nDuring 29-day analytic window surrounding SARS-CoV-2 testing.\nFive-day window before the analytic window.\nThe cohort consisted of veterans (n = 7325) residing in CLCs. A total of 453 (6.0%) veterans tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Those in whom SARS-CoV-2 was confirmed were older (76.2 vs. 74.2 years, P &lt; .001) than those with negative results (Table 1 ). Racial differences were small and without statistically significant differences. SARS-CoV-2-positive residents had a higher maximum temperature (37.7 vs. 37.1 C, P &lt; .001). In both cohorts, the baseline temperature was 36.6 C (SD +- 0.2) and a temperature deviation of 2 SD is approximately 0.5 C.\nTemperature in nursing home residents with and without SARS-CoV-2. The graph depicts daily temperature before (negative days) and after (positive days) the testing for SARS-CoV-2 (T0). The shaded area represents the 95% confidence intervals.\n Figure 1 illustrates the first daily temperatures of those with and without SARS-CoV-2 infection. Residents with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection had statistically if not clinically significant temperature elevations beginning 7 days before COVID testing. The highest temperature in the SARS-CoV-2+ group peaked on the day of testing (37.0 +- 0.6 C) at which time 28 (6.3%) of these residents met the CDC-guided 38.0 C fever criterion. During the 14 days of follow-up, the average temperature in those with SARS-CoV-2+ test did not fall within 0.1 C of the group without SARS-CoV-2 infections.\nTemperature trends according to maximum temperature. This compares daily temperatures relative to the maximum temperature. T0 is defined as the day of maximum temperature. SARS-CoV-2 groups are defined as those who are able to mount a maximum temperature of &gt;=38.0 C, the lowest quartile, and the remainder. The shaded area represents the 95% confidence intervals.\n Figure 2 centers the maximum temperature (Tmax) during the 2 weeks preceding and following the SARS-CoV-2 testing. Among those with confirmed SARS-CoV-2, those (n = 118, 26.6%) who mounted a Tmax &gt;=38.0 C had higher temperatures during the entire 4-week window. Those with SARS-CoV-2 in the lowest Tmax quartile had the least temperature variation. The CDC fever threshold of 38 C was not met by 73.4% of residents during the study window.

(A) Percentage of the population that attains 1 or more change(s) from baseline. (B) Those with 2 or more changes from baseline. A reference line is drawn at 0.5 C change.\nMeasurement of temperature deviation from baseline has been proposed as a mechanism to detect underlying infectious disease in nursing home residents. Most residents (79.7%, n = 353) with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 did experience a 0.5 C elevation of their baseline values, and this elevation was noted at least twice in 62.5% (n = 277) (Table 2 ). Figure 3 examines potential temperature change from baseline values (0 C to 2.5 C) occurring more than once (Figure 3A) and more than twice (Figure 3B). Using a threshold increase from baseline occurring in multiple readings offers a favorable balance of sensitivity and specificity relative to a single reading.\nDiscussion\nWe describe peak and daily morning temperature variation 2 weeks before and after COVID-19 testing among VA CLC residents and the Tmax occurring during that interval. The morning temperatures in CLC residents with SARS-CoV-2 typically began rising a week or more before reaching Tmax. Most residents (74%) did not reach a peak temperature over 38.0 C. The temperature for those with SARS-CoV-2 whose Tmax was at least 0.5 C higher from baseline generally remained elevated for the 14 days of follow-up.\nCurrent guidance from the CDC focuses on temperature monitoring for COVID-19 surveillance.   Although fever adds specificity for COVID-19 screening, fever of 38.0 C has not been reliably present, even for those reporting to the hospital; only 42% have met the CDC fever criterion. A fever threshold definition of 38.0 C can serve as an excellent proxy for underlying COVID-19 population prevalence, but such a threshold lacks sensitivity for surveillance purposes when applied to a nursing home population. Such a high threshold can delay early recognition of the need for and implementation of systematic testing and additional life-saving infection control measures for frail, older nursing residents. Most (62.5%, n = 277) CLC residents with SARS-CoV-2 have at least 2 deviations from baseline of 0.5 C, which is more sensitive and specific than an absolute threshold of 38 .0C. As a result, the current fever threshold as a screening criterion for SARS-CoV-2 infection should be reconsidered.\nThis is the latest in a string of literature that describes substantial variability in baseline vital signs among older people. With the use of electronic health records (EHRs) that store vital signs, including temperature, we can establish a personalized baseline temperature range for the older nursing facility resident,   thus allowing the record EHR system to alert staff when a resident's temperature exceeds this range. It is time to assess if an EHR alert of out-of-range temperatures can improve disease surveillance and result in earlier interventions in general, if not specifically for COVID-19.\nThe strengths of this analysis include the robust nursing home sample, the near universal monitoring of COVID-19, and the daily monitoring of temperature. These data collections allow for the construction of a more comprehensive picture of temperature and vital signs and can also inform decisions for SARS-CoV-2 testing and follow-up. We note 2 important limitations. First, we have not distinguished sensitivity of temperature thresholds for SARS-CoV-2 detection when separated between individuals who have met other symptom screening criteria from those who do not. However, the systematic approach by the VHA to perform national testing and the exclusion of individuals with known COVID-19 suggest that the vast majority of these individuals were asymptomatic at the time of testing. Second, the findings may not be generalizable to an older population as a whole because our sample is limited to one that is predominantly male with extensive comorbidities. The universal screening provided an important measurement structure, but limits our knowledge of which residents might have been screened otherwise.\nConclusions and Implications\nMost older nursing home residents do have temperature elevations when infected with SARS-CoV-2, but this elevation infrequently meets a fever threshold 38.0 C. Lower temperature excursions, such as 0.5 C, can improve sensitivity and recurrent excursions specificity for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Consideration of triggering COVID-19 screening based on an excursion threshold from a personalized temperature range may lead to earlier recognition of COVID-19 activity in a long-term care setting.\nReferences\nEpidemiology of Covid-19 in a long-term care facility in King County, Washington\nAsymptomatic and presymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections in residents of a long-term care skilled nursing facility -

aimed to identify clinical characteristics and epidemiological factors associated with influenza among community-dwelling adults aged ?60 years presenting to emergency departments.\n\n\nMethods\nWe identified patients with influenza-compatible chief complaints presenting to emergency departments of six acute care hospitals in Ontario, Canada during the 2011/12 and 2012/13 influenza seasons.\n\n Clinical characteristics, medical history and demographics were collected by patient interview, chart review and by contacting vaccine providers.\n\n Nasopharyngeal swabs were tested for influenza using polymerase chain reaction.\n\n We modeled predictors of influenza using multivariable logistic regression models that compared individuals with and without influenza.\n\n\nResults\nOf 1318 participants, 151 (11 %) had influenza (98 A/H3N2, 12 A/H1N1, 4 A [not sub-typed], 37 B).\n\n In the multivariable model, clinical symptoms associated with influenza were cough (OR 6.4, 95 % CI 3.2, 13.0), feverishness and/or triage temperature ?37.2 °C (OR 3.0, 95 % CI 2.0, 4.7), 2–5 days from symptom onset to the emergency department visit (OR 2.2, 95 % CI 1.5, 3.2), and wheezing (OR 2.1, 95 % CI 1.3, 3.3).\n\n The effect of cough on influenza increased with older age.\n\n Epidemiological factors associated with increased odds for influenza included weeks when ?10 % influenza tests from provincial laboratories were positive (OR 5.1, 95 % CI 1.2, 21.7) and exposure to a person with influenza-like illness (OR 1.9, 95 % CI 1.3, 2.8).\n\n Among participants with influenza, only 47 (31 %) met the U.\n\nS.\n\n Centers for Disease Control and Prevention criteria for influenza-like illness (temperature ?37.8 °C and cough and/or sore throat).\n\n\nConclusions\nAs in younger adults, cough and feverishness are the two symptoms most predictive of influenza in the elderly.\n\n Current influenza-like illness definitions did not adequately capture influenza in older adults.\n\n\n","id":"PMC5084347","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"BioMed

health conditions of the residents and the movement of health care personnel among facilities in a region.\n\n\nMethods\nAfter identification on February 28, 2020, of a confirmed case of Covid-19 in a skilled nursing facility in King County, Washington, Public Health–Seattle and King County, aided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, launched a case investigation, contact tracing, quarantine of exposed persons, isolation of confirmed and suspected cases, and on-site enhancement of infection prevention and control.\n\n\nResults\nAs of March 18, a total of 167 confirmed cases of Covid-19 affecting 101 residents, 50 health care personnel, and 16 visitors were found to be epidemiologically linked to the facility.\n\n Most cases among residents included respiratory illness consistent with Covid-19; however, in 7 residents no symptoms were documented.\n\n Hospitalization rates for facility residents, visitors, and staff were 54.5%, 50.0%, and 6.0%, respectively.\n\n The case fatality rate for residents was 33.7% (34 of 101).\n\n As of March 18, a total of 30 long-term care facilities with at least one confirmed case of Covid-19 had been identified in King County.\n\n\nConclusions\nIn the context of rapidly escalating Covid-19 outbreaks, proactive steps by long-term care facilities to identify and exclude potentially infected staff and visitors, actively monitor for potentially infected patients, and implement appropriate infection prevention and control measures are needed to prevent the introduction of Covid-19.\n","id":"PMC7121761","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Massachusetts Medical Society","authors":[{"firstname":"Temet

among acutely admitted older medical patients: a cohort study","abstract":"Background\nOlder people have the highest incidence of acute medical admissions.\n\n Old age and acute hospital admissions are associated with a high risk of adverse health outcomes after discharge, such as reduced physical performance, readmissions and mortality.\n\n Hospitalisations in this population are often by acute admission and through the emergency department.\n\n This, along with the rapidly increasing proportion of older people, warrants the need for clinically feasible tools that can systematically assess vulnerability in older medical patients upon acute hospital admission.\n\n These are essential for prioritising treatment during hospitalisation and after discharge.\n\n\nMethods\nA cohort study of acutely admitted medical patients aged 65 or older.\n\n Survival time within a 3 years post-discharge follow up period was used as the outcome.\n\n The associations between the markers and survival time were investigated by Cox regression analyses.\n\n For analyses, all markers were grouped by quartiles.\n\n\nResults\nA total of 4,005 patients were included.\n\n Among the 3,172 patients without a cancer diagnosis, mortality within 3 years was 39.9%.\n\n Univariate and multiple regression analyses for each marker showed that all were significantly associated with post-discharge survival.\n\n The changes between the estimates for the FI-OutRef quartiles in the univariate- and the multiple analyses were negligible.\n\n Among all the markers investigated, FI-OutRef had the highest hazard ratio of the fourth quartile versus the first quartile: 3.45 (95% CI: 2.83-s4.22, P &lt; 0.001).\n\n\nConclusion\nAmong acutely admitted older medical patients, FI-OutRef was strongly associated with long-term mortality.\n\n This association was independent of age, sex, and number of chronic diagnoses, new chronic diagnoses, and new acute admissions.\n\n Hence FI-OutRef could be a biomarker of advancement of aging within the acute care setting.\n\n\nElectronic supplementary material\nThe online version of this article (doi:10.1186/s12877-017-0434-3) contains supplementary material, which is

variables such that they could be mapped to the interval 0–1, where 0 = absence of a deficit, and 1= full expression of the deficit.\n\n These individual deficit scores were combined in an index, where 0= no deficit present, and 1= all 40 deficits present.\n\n The values of the index were well fit by a gamma distribution.\n\n Between the baseline and follow-up cohorts, the age-related slope of deficit accumulation increased from 0.020 (95% confidence interval, 0.014–0.026) to 0.026 (0.020–0.032).\n\n The 99% limit to deficit accumulation was 0.6 in the baseline cohort and 0.7 in the follow-up cohort.\n\n Multivariate Cox analysis showed the frailty index, age and sex to be significant predictors of mortality.\n\n\nConclusion\nA systematic process for creating a frailty index, which relates deficit accumulation to the individual risk of death, showed reproducible properties in the Yale Precipitating Events Project cohort study.\n\n This method of quantifying frailty can aid our understanding of frailty-related health characteristics in older adults.\n\n\n","id":"PMC2573877","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"BioMed Central","authors":[{"firstname":"Samuel

Observational evidence linking nutrition with frailty appears most robust for dietary quality: for example, dietary patterns such as the Mediterranean diet appear to be protective.\n In addition, research on specific foods, such as a higher consumption of fruit and vegetables and lower consumption of ultra-processed foods are consistent, with healthier profiles linked to lower frailty risk.\n Few dietary intervention studies have been conducted to date, although a growing number of trials that combine supplementation with exercise training suggest a multi-domain approach may be more effective.\n This review is based on an interdisciplinary workshop, held in November 2020, and synthesises current understanding of dietary influences on frailty, focusing on opportunities for

Three serial point prevalence studies were conducted on all residents and employees in 14-day intervals and percent positive was used as marker for effective infection control efforts. A multidisciplinary strike team from acute care was used to disseminate infection control education and support to long term care partners. These results highlight the need for swift identification and action in congregant high risk settings to prevent rapid spread and large scale outbreaks of COVID-19.\nBackground\nIn the United States, the elderly population is the most vulnerable and likely to succumb to complications and die of COVID-19. We have seen multiple reports of deaths due to a COVID-19 outbreak in group living facilities. Beginning with the Life Care Center in Kirkland, Washington, multiple confirmed cases of COVID-19 affecting residents, healthcare personnel (HCP), and visitors were found to be epidemiologically linked to an outbreak. Since then, a large number of long term care (LTC) facilities have reported multiple outbreaks and deaths from COVID-19. The Florida Department of Health reported a total of 665 deaths from COVID-19 at such facilities out of 1,875 total deaths in the state reflecting a grim 35% of all deaths. As of May 12, 2020 the Florida Department of Health had reported there were 1,601 infected residents of LTC facilities, 2,063 positive residents that were transferred to acute care facilities, and 1,851 infected staff in 482 long-term care facilities throughout the state. \nThe population of postacute facilities including LTC assisted living facilities have been greatly affected during the COVID-19 pandemic. There are many risk factors that continue to negatively predispose this community. Residents are one of the most vulnerable populations due to their increased age and multiple comorbidities leading to debilitation. Many are unable to communicate any changes to their health or offer insight into new onset of symptoms. This leads to a delay in identifying symptomatic individuals who may have been shedding virus in close proximity to staff and other residents in the congregant setting. Caretakers and HCP in this setting need to be extremely vigilant in their assessments while discerning minute fluctuations in patient status. Another prominent risk factor is that many staff at postacute care facilities may work part-time at other facilities promoting an exhausted workforce that has little opportunity for self-care including sleep, nutrition, and a lower quality of health that could increase risk of susceptibility of illness. Part-time workers may not have access to paid time off and are forced to work while ill, further contributing an introduction of virus into the facility. Other cross-contamination risks, inadequate protocols including infection control practices and access to personal protective equipment (PPE) may be contributing factors. Standalone facilities not connected to large health systems have poor access to testing and hurdles to quickly identifying and triaging residents. There are always opportunities for a regional control approach to infection control involving transitions between acute care and postacute care. This report demonstrates the outcome of a COVID-19 outbreak investigation in a 120 bed long-term care facility and containment strategy using prevalence testing and infection control best practices.\nMethods\nInterventions for an outbreak containment strategy began with review of literature. From the beginning of the pandemic, all Centers for Disease Control (CDC), Agency for Healthcare Administration (AHCA) and Centers for Medicare and Medicaid (CMS) guidelines were put into practice. A facility walkthrough was conducted with trained infection prevention and control practitioners and facilities engineers to identify opportunities in hand hygiene, PPE use, air efficiency, and HVAC optimization. An infection control strike team as described in the CMS nursing home best practices toolkit was integrated into the facility response. The strike team consisted of affiliated hospital system physician and administrative leadership, trained infection prevention and control practitioners and facilities engineers. There was close communication with local paramedics and emergency medical services (EMS) providers to identify potential outbreaks in all surrounding long-term care facilities by tracking residents transferred to the emergency department (ED). This facilitated communication from acute care to postacute care and involved local health department personnel immediately to facilitate fast outbreak response. These were considered baseline interventions.\nSecondary interventions were started once a visiting provider tested positive. HCP and all facility residents were screened twice daily for symptoms including shortness of breath, new or changes in cough, sore throat, muscle aches, and temperature on or over 100 F. HCP were screened at the beginning and the end of the shift. The facility began to actively check anyone entering the facility for signs and symptoms of COVID-19 including temperature checking. No entry to the facility was allowed if anyone screened positive for symptoms of COVID-19 or had a temperature equal or over 100 F. After a few weeks, all visitors to the facility were banned to control introduction of burgeoning community spread. Group activities including communal dining were stopped to maintain social distancing. Therapies were conducted one-on one inside resident rooms. Increased monitoring of ill residents including assessment of symptoms, vital signs, oxygen saturation, and respiratory exam at least 3 times daily was instituted. Immediate isolation in a separate wing of the facility with designated staff for further evaluation was implemented while the symptoms were evaluated. As the elderly may not show a typical course of the disease, atypical symptoms such as new or worsening malaise, new dizziness, or diarrhea were also included as part of the screening process for residents.\nThe staff that were working in multiple facilities were considered to pose a higher risk and were encouraged to disclose to administrators if they had exposures or contact with identified COVID-19 cases in other facilities. Staff were offered more shifts at the facility in order to incentivize working in one facility only. Telemedicine was instituted for all providers to see patients virtually instead of coming into the building thus limiting exposure as much as possible.\nWhen concern arose for an institutional outbreak, universal prevalence testing was started. Using occupational health exposure best practices, a routine testing protocol for COVID-19 by RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA was instituted by collecting nasopharyngeal (NP) swab specimens on all residents and staff every 14 days. Testing was performed at the Memorial Regional South Hospital Molecular Laboratory of Memorial Healthcare System using the CDC 2019-Novel Coronavirus Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel. The point prevalence testing was conducted 3 times during a 6-week period and included all residents, HCP and other facility workers such as contract environmental, dietary personnel, security officers, and administrative staff. Trained nurses skilled in the correct technique for specimen collection were recruited from our affiliated hospital to collect the specimens in order to decrease the incidence of false negative results.\nA cohort unit was established to avoid placing unexposed residents into a shared space with previously exposed residents. The cohort unit is a dedicated area in the facility to care for residents who may have been exposed to COVID-19 and included private rooms with a private bathroom. This unit housed residents exposed to the positive provider, new admissions or readmissions in a separate location in the facility for 14 days. We implemented close monitoring of roommates and other residents who might have been exposed to an individual with COVID-19. These residents were kept on contact and droplet precautions including eye protection. We assigned dedicated staff for these groups for the same shifts and they only worked in this area of the facility. Residents were transferred out of the cohort observation unit and into the facility's general population if they remained afebrile and without symptoms and had a negative SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR test for 14 days after their exposure or admission. Testing at the end of this period was considered to increase the certainty that the resident was not infected. All positive, confirmed cases were transferred to the hospital for complete medical evaluation and airborne isolation which is not available at the LTC facility. The cohort unit did not see any conversions to positive.\nThe affiliated hospital infection control policy following closely with state regulations delineated patients were not to be discharged to postacute care facilities for at least 14 days after positive SARS-CoV-2 RT PCR test and only after 2 negative NPs 24 hours apart. If the patient had a tracheostomy, a tracheal aspirate was also sent for SARS-CoV-2 RT PCR testing. If the patient had a tracheostomy, a tracheal aspirate was also sent for COVID-19 PCR. Occupational health, infectious disease and infection control specialist ensured return to work protocols were consistent with CDC and local health department.\nThe practice of universal masking was implemented. Facial coverings were required of all persons entering the facility and whenever residents were leaving their rooms. Hand hygiene utilizing World Health Organization's 5 Moments was enforced using alcohol based hand sanitizer in every room and common areas of the facility. PPE use and supply was monitored daily with conservation methods in place recommended by the CDC. We periodically reviewed strategies to optimize supplies of gowns, procedure masks, face shields, and N95 respirators before shortages occurred.\nDietary and sanitation strategies to decrease potential spread of infection were applied. Sanitizing began three times daily in all food preparation, serving, staff dining areas and flat surfaces. Terminally cleaning of kitchen completed daily. The facility staff were socially distant at lunch enforced by different scheduled times for breaks and three per breakroom rule. Facility cleaning and disinfection rotations were increased. We ensured EPA-registered hospital-approved disinfectants from List N were used according to the manufacturer's instructions for use. High touch surfaces including bed rails, bedside tables, medicine carts and computers are cleaned twice daily if not more. All common areas are cleaned daily. Restrooms are cleaned twice daily.\nResults\nOver 6 weeks, we were able to contain the spread of the disease shown by the prevalence decreasing from 5.4% to 3.6% to 0.41%. Infection control interventions at the facility were implemented on March 4, 2020. The first patient that tested positive for COVID-19 at the facility was diagnosed on April 7, 2020. This patient developed respiratory symptoms without a fever and was transferred to the hospital. During case investigation it was discovered that 10 days before this first patient was diagnosed positive, an ARNP who cares for the patients in the south wing disclosed she was diagnosed with COVID-19 on March 28, 2020 but was asymptomatic. Prior to her diagnosis she had been at the facility and was stated she abided by all the infection control protocols. The ARNP was tested as part of exposure at another LTC facility not associated with our healthcare system.\nFollowing the diagnosis of the first COVID-19 positive case, on April 8, 2020 all staff and residents were tested for COVID-19 by collection of a NP swab specimen for RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2. We implemented serial point prevalence testing of all staff and residents every 14 days. Our findings included the following: a total of 9 patients were positive at the facility during the period of April 7-May 6, 2020. All the patients that were found to be positive came from the rehabilitation (south wing) of the facility. The LTC unit (north wing) had no positive cases. The APRN provider who was the first known positive was epidemiologically linked to 2 of the 9 positive cases found within the facility. All positive patients were referred to the system acute care hospital for assessment in airborne isolation which was not available at the LTC facility. Of the 9 patients, only 2 had symptoms. Of the remaining 7, 2 are completely resolved. The 5 are in the process of testing for resolution. There were 2 patients' deaths during this period related to family decisions to place them in hospice care due to other comorbidities unrelated to the recent COVID-19 diagnoses. Patients returned to the facility once they met CDC's test based strategy for clearance and were placed in in the facility's cohort unit for 14 days prior to transfer into general population.\nPeriodic point prevalence of positive SARS-CoV-2 NP swab specimens for RT-PCR in facility residents and employees\nTable 1	 	\n	Residents	Employees plus contract staff	Total tests	 	Period	Number of screening tests	Tested positive	Number of screening tests	Tested positive	Number of screening tests	Tested positive	 	April 7	105	5 (4.8%)	176	10 (5.7%)	278	15 (5.4%)	 	April 22	86	4 (4.7%)	175	5 (2.9%)	250	9 (3.6%)	 	May 6	85	1 (1.2%)	173	1 (0.6%)	241	1 (0.41%)	 						769	25 (3.3%)	 		 	\nA total of 11 employees (nurses and nursing assistants) and 5 contracted staff (environmental services and security) were positive; all of them were asymptomatic. Employees were immediately quarantined and educated on home isolation and were not allowed back to the facility until 2 NP swabs collected 24 hours apart both tested negative. Employees were quarantined if they had a household member positive for COVID-19. All positive staff were asymptomatic and self-isolated at home. Positive staff were self-quarantined for 14 days and returned once asymptomatic for 72 hours and after 2 negative SARS-CoV-2 RT PCR tests of NP specimens 24 hours apart. Table 1 for summary of point prevalence studies in residents and employees.\nDiscussion\nAfter the first death was reported in Life Care Center on February 26, 2020, concern for nosocomial spread of COVID-19 disease inside LTC facilities was heightened. Early identification of the highly infective COVID-19 respiratory virus was paramount in prevention of an outbreak. We recognized the need for universal prevalence testing as a containment strategy when we detected a provider had tested positive for COVID-19 and their patient subsequently became symptomatic. Residents of LTC facilities are at a high risk of exposure from personnel working at the facilities (physicians, nurse practitioners, environmental service, dietary, physical and occupational therapy) where COVID-19 has community spread. These residents are usually older and disabled with multiple comorbidities. The residents may be pre-symptomatic, asymptomatic, present with uncommon symptoms, and may be unable to communicate changes in status. Our universal prevalence testing showed most of the positive patients were asymptomatic. During the time between prevalence testing there were symptomatic patients, they were tested and were negative. LTC facility staff need to be extremely vigilant to any changes in the residents and refer for testing immediately. Staff need to be screened as frequently as twice a day for symptoms including fever in addition to molecular testing at intervals of at least 14 days. Staff must follow strict infection control guidance set by the CDC to prevent the spread of the disease. LTC facility staff are usually underpaid compare to hospital staff and they are usually employed at multiple facilities. If possible, LTC facility staff should only work at a single facility during a pandemic. There is a higher possibility of exposure when they work at other facilities that may not have the same standards for the use of PPE and screening of employees. As well as being at high risk at a community level, LTC employees may increase their risk when they move around from facility to facility.\nThe cohort unit for exposed and new admissions was an effective way to separate and screen higher risk individuals for the 14-day incubation period. Keeping these patients on isolation and with dedicated staff would make contact tracing for exposure identification easier.\nOrganizational leadership remained supportive and effective with communication to all HCP during every stage of the containment process. We did not limit our practices to our facility. Our outreach and sharing of information extended to the LTC facilities within our community. We worked closely with our local EMS agencies to track daily transports of LTC patients and ED encounters to identify potential outbreaks early. Hospital leadership communicated directly with facility administration when COVID-19 positive patients were encountered. In some instances where the rate of infection was increasing, sending in a strike force to the LTC facility enabled us to identify risk and share best practices to contain the virus spread. This allowed timely intervention, tracing and focused testing at these LTC facilities to identify asymptomatic carriers, both residents and staff. Hospital leadership maintained open ongoing communication with these LTC facilities to assist with infection control deficiencies and provide resources when needed. As we can see in this particular program evaluation, communication and close contact with area LTC facilities, quick action and close vigilance contained a potential outbreak. A successful containment strategy includes regularly scheduled point of care prevalence testing, organizational leadership that promotes strict compliance to infection control guidelines, diligent occupational health programs, and continuous screening of their residents and HCP.\nConclusions\nWe instituted a structured prevalence testing programmatic protocol and infection control best practices for a facility during the pandemic in hard hit area. We did so by implementing strict infection control measures as well as periodic prevalence testing of residents and staff for COVID-19 by collection of a NP swab specimen for RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 at 14-day intervals. Over 6 weeks, we were able to contain the spread of the disease shown by the prevalence decreasing from 5.4% to 3.6% to 0.41%. Overall the facility has conducted 769 tests of which only 3.3% have tested positive. We also worked closely with our local EMS agencies to track daily transports of LTC patients and ED encounters to identify potential outbreaks early. Hospital leadership communicated directly with facility administration when COVID-19 positive patients were encountered. This allowed timely intervention, tracing and focused testing at these LTC facilities to identify asymptomatic carriers, both residents and staff. Hospital leadership maintained open communication with these LTC facilities to assist with infection control deficiencies and provide resources when needed. By following specific testing protocols and strict infection control guidelines as well as close involvement of the regional acute care ED leadership, this model has proven to slow the spread of COVID-19 in a facility to less than local community conversion percentages. Point prevalence testing and infection control best practices are paramount to the containment of an outbreak. Direct and open communication with staff, close relationships with area hospitals, dynamic infection prevention and control measures are needed to quickly contain an outbreak.\nReferences\nPublic Health - Seattle &amp; King County; CDC COVID-19 Investigation Team.

systematic review","abstract":"Introduction\nPatients with acute respiratory failure requiring respiratory support with invasive mechanical ventilation while awaiting lung transplantation are at a high risk of death.\n\n Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) has been proposed as an alternative bridging strategy to mechanical ventilation.\n\n The aim of this study was to assess the current evidence regarding how the ECMO bridge influences patients’ survival and length of hospital stay.\n\n\nMethods\nWe performed a systematic review by searching PubMed, EMBASE and the bibliographies of retrieved articles.\n\n Three reviewers independently screened citation titles and abstracts and agreement was reached by consensus.\n\n We selected studies enrolling patients who received ECMO with the intention to bridge lung transplant.\n\n We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs), case–control studies and case series with ten or more patients.\n\n Outcomes of interest included survival and length of hospital stay.\n\n Quantitative data summaries were made when feasible.\n\n\nResults\nWe identified 82 studies, of which 14 were included in the final analysis.\n\n All 14 were retrospective studies which enrolled 441 patients in total.\n\n Because of the broad heterogeneity among the studies we did not perform a meta-analysis.\n\n The mortality rate of patients on ECMO before lung transplant and the one-year survival ranged from 10% to 50% and 50% to 90%, respectively.\n\n The intensive care and hospital length of stay ranged between a median of 15 to 47 days and 22 to 47 days, respectively.\n\n There was a general paucity of high-quality data and significant heterogeneity among studies in the enrolled patients and technology used, which confounded analysis.\n\n\nConclusions\nIn most of the studies, patients on ECMO while awaiting lung transplantation also received invasive mechanical ventilation.\n\n Therefore, whether ECMO as an alternative, rather than an adjunction, to invasive mechanical ventilation is a better bridging strategy to lung transplantation still remains an unresolved issue.\n\n ECMO support as a bridge for these patients could provide acceptable one-year survival.\n\n Future studies are needed to investigate ECMO as part of an algorithm of care for patients with end-stage lung disease.\n\n\n","id":"PMC4302424","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"BioMed

The disease is associated with substantially higher mortality among the elderly and those who have comorbid medical conditions; the risk of death is 10-20 times higher among persons over age 70 compared to those under age 50 across diverse epidemiologic settings. Long-term care facility (LTCF) residents are at particularly high risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection and death given their advanced age and high prevalence of chronic medical conditions, combined with functional impairment that necessitates frequent, close contact with healthcare providers, who may inadvertently spread disease among residents. Despite comprising &lt;1% of the U.S. population, a staggering 42% of COVID-related deaths are among LTCF residents. Several outbreaks among LTCFs have been reported, most notably the earliest description from Washington state of 167 cases linked to a single facility, with a case fatality of 33.7% among residents.\nMass screening for SARS-CoV-2 infection in high-risk populations has been proposed as an efficient method for identifying those most likely to have severe disease and for curtailing widespread transmission among vulnerable individuals. Because nearly half of persons with COVID-19 can be asymptomatic or presymptomatic, but still infectious, active screening can facilitate early identification, supportive treatment, and enhanced infection control measures. To date, more than 450 LTCFs in Georgia have reported at least one COVID-19 case; LTCF residents comprise 10% of all cases reported (N=6,591), but account for 45% of all deaths with a COVID-19 diagnosis. Thus, evaluating the outcomes of active screening initiatives in LTCFs is a high priority.\nIn conjunction with the Georgia Emergency Management Agency and the National Guard, the Fulton County Board of Health (FCBOH) has conducted mass screening in LTCFs since March 2020. We report results from 15 LTCFs where mass screening was conducted among residents and staff after cases had been reported and 13 LTCFs where preventive mass screening was conducted (i.e., where no cases had yet been reported).\nMethods\nFulton County includes the city of Atlanta, with a total population of approximately 1.1 million persons in 2019. Mass screenings of residents and staff in LTCFs began in March 2020 and initially occurred in response to reports of LTCF residents who were hospitalized with COVID-19 symptoms and thereafter tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 virus (i.e., &quot;Response group&quot;). Due in part to increasing outbreaks identified in LTCFs across Georgia, supplemental support from the National Guard was added in April 2020 to enable mass screening of LTCFs irrespective of prior COVID-19 case identification. LTCFs which underwent mass COVID-19 screenings of staff and residents as a preventive measure (i.e. prior to identification of an active case) are considered the &quot;Preventive group&quot;.\nNasopharyngeal swab samples were collected by trained healthcare staff from FCBOH and transported to various Georgia laboratories to be tested using Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR). Six facilities contracted private companies to collect nasopharyngeal swabs and test samples for residents and staff using RT-PCR, then reported results to the FCBOH. Collection, transportation, and testing of samples were conducted in accordance with the most recent CDC guidelines. All results were reported back to the facilities, where residents and staff were referred for appropriate care depending on test results.\nWe defined LTCF as any facility which provides skilled nursing services, including nursing homes, memory care, and assisted living facilities located in Fulton County. A confirmed case was defined as a person with a positive SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR result. We included all confirmed COVID-19 positive individuals in our final case count per facility, regardless of whether they were diagnosed through mass screening or through other testing (e.g., as part of diagnostic evaluation of respiratory illness). Frequency distributions (counts and percentages) were used to describe COVID-19 positivity, hospitalizations, and deaths among residents and staff. Fisher's exact test was used to test differences between facility groups and p&lt;0.05 was used as the cut-off for statistical significance.\nThis activity was reviewed by the Georgia Department of Public Health and deemed exempt from IRB review as a public health surveillance activity in response to the COVID-19 emergency response.\nResults\nMass testing was conducted in 28 LTCFs where a total of 5,671 individuals (2,868 [50.6%] residents and 2,803 [49.4%] staff) were screened. Fifteen of these facilities underwent mass screening in response to a reported diagnosis of COVID-19 in a resident (Table: &quot;Response group&quot; Facilities 1-15), while 13 of the facilities did not have a known active case of COVID-19 at the time of testing and underwent mass screening as a preventive measure (&quot;Preventive group&quot; Facilities 16-28).\nOverall, 28.6% (n=821) of residents and 9.4% (n=264) of staff screened were confirmed to have COVID-19. The prevalence of COVID-19 infection was significantly higher among residents and staff of LTCFs screened in response to a known case, compared to LTCFs screened for preventive purposes (Residents: Response group 47.2% vs. Preventive group 1.5%, p&lt;0.0001; Staff: Response group 12.8% vs. Preventive group 1.7%, p&lt;0.0001; Table). All 15 (100%) of the Response group facilities had a substantial proportion of both residents and staff with SARS-CoV-2 infection (Residents: median 46% [IQR 27% -73%] infected; Staff: median 9.4% [IQR 5.9% - 20%]). Although the infection rate was significantly lower in the Preventive Group facilities, 7 (54%) of 13 facilities still had at least one resident who was SARS-CoV-2 infected and 4 (31%) had at least one infected staff member.\nOf the 1,085 individuals (residents and staff) diagnosed with COVID-19, 18% (n=192) required hospitalization and 12% died (n=135). Although hospitalization rates did not differ significantly among COVID-positive residents in the Response group and those in the Preventive group (21% vs 29%, p=0.38), the magnitude of hospitalizations was overwhelmingly among residents and staff in LTCFs in the Response group (n=186 of 191 hospitalized, 97%). Similarly, among the overall 135 deaths among COVID-positive individuals across all 28 LTCFs, the majority (n=131, 97%) occurred among residents living in Response group facilities.\nDiscussion\nLong-term care facilities have borne a disproportionate burden of COVID-19 morbidity and mortality. In this study, we analyzed data collected from mass screenings conducted among 28 LTCFs in Fulton County, Georgia, both as a response to a confirmed case and as a preventive measure before active infections were identified. We found that more than 1 in 4 LTCF residents, and 1 in 10 LTCF staff, had SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, in facilities where testing was conducted only after a case had been identified, a dramatically greater proportion of residents (47% vs 1.5%) and staff (13% vs 1.7%) were found to be infected, suggesting SARS-CoV-2 infection was already widespread by the time a single case was diagnosed through passive means. Encouragingly, among LTCFs screened before a case was passively diagnosed, only about 2% of residents and 2% of staff were found to be positive, and few deaths were reported. These data support the role of active screening in LTCFs, in addition to routine infection prevention and control measures, as part of the COVID-19 response.\nIn our study, LTCFs with at least one COVID-19 case passively diagnosed had a median of 46% of its residents infected and 9.4% staff. This finding is consistent with data from other settings that suggest 10-100 cases may be present for every 1 case diagnosed. An additional important finding from our study is that although facilities in the Preventive Group had lower SARS-CoV-2 infection rates, the majority still had at least one infected resident and one-third had at least one infected staff member. These data support recent guidance provided by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), which recommends weekly testing for LTCF staff regardless of the presence of COVID-19 cases in the LTCF. CMS further recommends that if a SARS-CoV-2 infection has been identified within the facility, weekly testing should be conducted of residents until all have tested negative.\nThe lower rate of infection in the Preventive group compared to the Response group demonstrates the rapid spread of COVID-19 that can occur if identification of infection is delayed until the onset of symptoms. Mass screening can diagnose residents and staff who are infected with SARS-CoV-2 but are in an asymptomatic or presymptomatic phase. Identification of such individuals can lead to the prevention of additional infections by isolating residents and excluding staff that are infected, initiating contact tracing, and increasing infection prevention measures including cleaning and sterilization procedures.\nOne concern with conducting serial RT-PCR testing of infected individuals until they test negative is the uncertainty of whether a person who tests positive is actively infected and infectious, or whether a positive test represents non-viable viral material. A recent study found that the SARS-CoV-2 virus was unable to be cultured in specimens that tested positive by RT-PCR 8 days after symptom onset, though individuals diagnosed with COVID-19 can continue to have detectable virus by PCR for as long as 6 weeks. Another challenge to COVID-19 surveillance in some LTCFs is the fear of negative public perceptions when reporting infections. In response to this issue and COVID-19 outbreaks in LTCFs in Fulton County, the FCBOH has worked to improve collaboration and communication between LTCFs and other governmental entities while providing support through stocking of personal protective equipment (PPE), training by state or locally designated infection prevention specialists, and facilitating opportunities for LTCFs to meet and discuss their strategies to prevent additional infections.\nOne limitation of this study is that LTCFs were screened based on reports of COVID-19 infections or requests by the facilities and were not selected at random to provide a representative sample. Nonetheless, these facilities represent 48% of licensed LTCFs and 44% of the total bed capacity in Fulton County. Due to low testing capacity in the early phase of the COVID response, most LTCFs screened early in the study period (April) were those with a known case (Response Group). Preemptive screening began in May when testing capacity increased with the addition of the National Guard to the COVID-19 screening efforts.\nWhile typical case investigations for COVID-19 require contacting individuals directly, we were unable to contact COVID-19 positive residents of LTCFs to obtain epidemiologic details such as the date of onset of symptoms or potential close contacts; we relied heavily on LTCFs to assist us in completing individual case investigations. Census lists provided by LTCFs and case reports from hospitals and medical examiners assisted in the identification and retroactive linkage of cases in residents and staff that were not reported by LTCFs and their subsequent inclusion in this analysis. Lastly, there may be several unmeasured factors that could account for differences between the LTCF groups, such as resident to staff ratio, resident and staff adherence to IPC measures, prevalence of comorbid conditions especially among residents, facility airflow design and maintenance practices, and degree of functional impairment that may predispose to more frequent and closer resident-staff interaction.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has underscored the fact that residents and staff of LTCFs represent a highly vulnerable population. Critical analyses of the mass screening efforts conduced in Fulton County provide support for active screening to identify cases early and increase infection control and prevention measures. Together, these measures can reduce spread of SARS-CoV-2 and can provide residents and staff with the best possible chance for a successful outcome from this devastating illness.\nDisclaimers: The findings and conclusions in this manuscript are those of the authors and do not necessarily represent the official position of the funders.

using polymerase chain reaction.\n\n We modeled predictors of influenza using multivariable logistic regression models that compared individuals with and without influenza.\n\n\nResults\nOf 1318 participants, 151 (11 %) had influenza (98 A/H3N2, 12 A/H1N1, 4 A [not sub-typed], 37 B).\n\n In the multivariable model, clinical symptoms associated with influenza were cough (OR 6.4, 95 % CI 3.2, 13.0), feverishness and/or triage temperature ?37.2 °C (OR 3.0, 95 % CI 2.0, 4.7), 2–5 days from symptom onset to the emergency department visit (OR 2.2, 95 % CI 1.5, 3.2), and wheezing (OR 2.1, 95 % CI 1.3, 3.3).\n\n The effect of cough on influenza increased with older age.\n\n Epidemiological factors associated with increased odds for influenza included weeks when ?10 % influenza tests from provincial laboratories were positive (OR 5.1, 95 % CI 1.2, 21.7) and exposure to a person with influenza-like illness (OR 1.9, 95 % CI 1.3, 2.8).\n\n Among participants with influenza, only 47 (31 %) met the U.\n\nS.\n\n Centers for Disease Control and Prevention criteria for influenza-like illness (temperature ?37.8 °C and cough and/or sore throat).\n\n\nConclusions\nAs in younger adults, cough and feverishness are the two symptoms most predictive of influenza in the elderly.\n\n Current influenza-like illness definitions did not adequately capture influenza in older adults.\n\n\n","id":"PMC5084347","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"BioMed

coronavirus indicating person-to-person transmission: a study of a family cluster","abstract":"Background\nAn ongoing outbreak of pneumonia associated with a novel coronavirus was reported in Wuhan city, Hubei province, China.\n\n Affected patients were geographically linked with a local wet market as a potential source.\n\n No data on person-to-person or nosocomial transmission have been published to date.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this study, we report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, radiological, and microbiological findings of five patients in a family cluster who presented with unexplained pneumonia after returning to Shenzhen, Guangdong province, China, after a visit to Wuhan, and an additional family member who did not travel to Wuhan.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of genetic sequences from these patients were done.\n\n\nFindings\nFrom Jan 10, 2020, we enrolled a family of six patients who travelled to Wuhan from Shenzhen between Dec 29, 2019 and Jan 4, 2020. Of six family members who travelled to Wuhan, five were identified as infected with the novel coronavirus.\n\n Additionally, one family member, who did not travel to Wuhan, became infected with the virus after several days of contact with four of the family members.\n\n None of the family members had contacts with Wuhan markets or animals, although two had visited a Wuhan hospital.\n\n Five family members (aged 36–66 years) presented with fever, upper or lower respiratory tract symptoms, or diarrhoea, or a combination of these 3–6 days after exposure.\n\n They presented to our hospital (The University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen) 6–10 days after symptom onset.\n\n They and one asymptomatic child (aged 10 years) had radiological ground-glass lung opacities.\n\n Older patients (aged &gt;60 years) had more systemic symptoms, extensive radiological ground-glass lung changes, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and increased C-reactive protein and lactate dehydrogenase levels.\n\n The nasopharyngeal or throat swabs of these six patients were negative for known respiratory microbes by point-of-care multiplex RT-PCR, but five patients (four adults and the child) were RT-PCR positive for genes encoding the internal RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and surface Spike protein of this novel coronavirus, which were confirmed by Sanger sequencing.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these five patients' RT-PCR amplicons and two full genomes by next-generation sequencing showed that this is a novel coronavirus, which is closest to the bat severe acute respiatory syndrome (SARS)-related coronaviruses found in Chinese horseshoe bats.\n\n\nInterpretation\nOur findings are consistent with person-to-person transmission of this novel coronavirus in hospital and family settings, and the reports of infected travellers in other geographical regions.\n\n\nFunding\nThe Shaw Foundation Hong Kong, Michael Seak-Kan Tong, Respiratory Viral Research Foundation Limited, Hui

Cases exported domestically were then estimated.\n\n We forecasted the national and global spread of 2019-nCoV, accounting for the effect of the metropolitan-wide quarantine of Wuhan and surrounding cities, which began Jan 23–24, 2020. We used data on monthly flight bookings from the Official Aviation Guide and data on human mobility across more than 300 prefecture-level cities in mainland China from the Tencent database.\n\n Data on confirmed cases were obtained from the reports published by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\n Serial interval estimates were based on previous studies of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV).\n\n A susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered metapopulation model was used to simulate the epidemics across all major cities in China.\n\n The basic reproductive number was estimated using Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods and presented using the resulting posterior mean and 95% credibile interval (CrI).\n\n\nFindings\nIn our baseline scenario, we estimated that the basic reproductive number for 2019-nCoV was 2·68 (95% CrI 2·47–2·86) and that 75?815 individuals (95% CrI 37?304–130?330) have been infected in Wuhan as of Jan 25, 2020. The epidemic doubling time was 6·4 days (95% CrI 5·8–7·1).\n\n We estimated that in the baseline scenario, Chongqing, Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Shenzhen had imported 461 (95% CrI 227–805), 113 (57–193), 98 (49–168), 111 (56–191), and 80 (40–139) infections from Wuhan, respectively.\n\n If the transmissibility of 2019-nCoV were similar everywhere domestically and over time, we inferred that epidemics are already growing exponentially in multiple major cities of China with a lag time behind the Wuhan outbreak of about 1–2 weeks.\n\n\nInterpretation\nGiven that 2019-nCoV is no longer contained within Wuhan, other major Chinese cities are probably sustaining localised outbreaks.\n\n Large cities overseas with close transport links to China could also become outbreak epicentres, unless substantial public health interventions at both the population and personal levels are implemented immediately.\n\n Independent self-sustaining outbreaks in major cities globally could become inevitable because of substantial exportation of presymptomatic cases and in the absence of large-scale public health interventions.\n\n Preparedness plans and mitigation interventions should be readied for quick deployment globally.\n\n\nFunding\nHealth and Medical Research Fund (Hong Kong, China).\n\n\n","id":"PMC7159271","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Elsevier Ltd.","authors":[{"firstname":"Joseph T","surname":"Wu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Kathy","surname":"Leung","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Gabriel M","surname":"Leung","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.2807/1560-7917.ES.2020.25.4.2000058","date":"2020-01-30","title":"Pattern of early human-to-human transmission of Wuhan 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), December 2019 to January 2020","abstract":"Since December 2019, China has been experiencing a large outbreak of a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) which can cause respiratory disease and severe pneumonia.\n We estimated the basic reproduction number R0 of 2019-nCoV to be around 2.2 (90% high density interval: 1.4–3.8), indicating the potential for sustained human-to-human transmission.\n Transmission characteristics appear to be of similar magnitude to severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and pandemic influenza, indicating a risk of global spread.\n","id":"PMC7001239","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC)","authors":[{"firstname":"Julien","surname":"Riou","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Christian L.","surname":"Althaus","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"N.

For every 10% increase in the proportion of staff living in a high prevalence community, the risk of testing positive increased by 6% (95% CI 1.04, 1.08).\nConclusions and Implications\nAmong long-term care residents diagnosed with COVID-19, nearly one-half were asymptomatic at the time of diagnosis. Predictors of COVID-19 infection included male sex, bowel incontinence, and staff residence in a community with a high burden of COVID-19. Universal testing of patients and staff in communities with high COVID-19 rates is essential to mitigate outbreaks.\nThe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by a novel coronavirus (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, SARS-Cov-2) has had a marked impact on every sector of society, with long-term care facilities and nursing homes bearing a disproportionate amount of disease burden and mortality.   In 2019 1.4 million persons, or approximately 3% of the US population age 65 years or older, resided in long-term care facilities. Presently in the United States, 40% of all COVID-19 related deaths have occurred among nursing home residents, with at least 6 states reporting more than one-half of deaths are in these facilities. The World Health Organization reported a similar proportion of fatalities in Europe from long-term care facilities. Thus understanding the presenting clinical symptoms, clinical course, and predictors of COVID-19 within long-term care facilities is paramount to crafting an informed societal response to this pandemic.\nLimited information exists on the presenting characteristics and clinical course of COVID-19 in long-term care residents. Epidemiologic studies suggest that many persons infected with COVID-19 do not develop symptoms: among 200 randomly selected community dwellers, 30% had evidence of antibodies to COVID-19 despite reporting no symptoms. Aging can affect common disease presentations, and older adults often present with atypical symptoms. Additional challenges are posed when long-term care residents with advanced dementia have an impaired ability to communicate their symptoms. A better understanding of the presenting symptoms and clinical course of COVID-19 in this vulnerable population may hasten diagnosis, which is critical to prevent the rapid, unintended spread of disease in this setting.\nFactors related to transmission of COVID-19 within long-term care facilities are also not well understood. Media attention has suggested that COVID-19 transmission in nursing homes may be related to poor quality of care, but patient and staff characteristics are likely to affect disease burden. For example, behavioral symptoms of dementia, such as wandering, could increase the risk of transmission. Also, residents with advanced dementia typically require assistance with toileting and feeding, demanding close personal contact with direct care staff. Staff who live in a neighborhood more severely affected by COVID-19 may then inadvertently increase the risk of transmission among these residents.\nThe objective of this study was to describe the presenting clinical characteristics and outcomes of long-term care residents affected by COVID-19 in a large, academic long-term care facility. Further, we described variation in the prevalence of COVID-19 infection across units, and we identified patient and staff characteristics associated with COVID-19 infection. We hypothesized that patient characteristics, such as wandering, and staff residence (ie, living in a community with a high burden of COVID-19), would be associated with testing positive for COVID-19.\nMethods\nStudy Population\nThis study was conducted in an approximately 500-bed academic long-term care facility in the Boston area. During the study period, there were 8 long-term care units, licensed as a long-term chronic care hospital. In addition, the facility housed 1 medically complex acute care unit, and a subacute rehabilitation unit which are excluded from this study. A no-visitor policy took place on March 12, 2020, with screening of staff symptoms upon facility entry. Staff were instructed to wear masks beginning March 25, 2020. This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board at Hebrew SeniorLife. Neither patients nor the public were involved in the design, or conduct, or reporting, or dissemination plans of our research.\nAll consecutive patients in the facility tested for COVID-19 between March 16, 2020 and May 8, 2020 were included in the study. Between March 16, 2020 and April 10, 2020 COVID-19 tests were ordered based on clinical suspicion of the disease or exposure to a confirmed case. Between April 11, 2020 and April 17, 2020, universal testing was implemented and every resident in the facility was tested for COVID-19. Patients who tested negative were re-tested based on clinical suspicion of the disease or known exposure to confirmed cases. We excluded residents with a positive COVID-19 test prior to admission to the facility (n = 16), patients on the subacute rehabilitation unit (n = 32), and patients in the medically complex acute care unit (n = 17).\nCOVID-19 Testing\nData on the name, dates, and test results of patients receiving the polymerase chain reaction test for COVID-19 was prospectively collected in a facility log. Testing was obtained by clinical staff within the facility using nasopharyngeal swabs and processed at an affiliated hospital with most results available within 24 hours.\nClinical Presentation\nUsing the electronic medical records of the facility, we reviewed nursing, nutrition, and medical provider notes to identify clinical symptoms on the calendar day the first positive test was ordered and the 3 preceding days, including of cough, anorexia, vomiting, or diarrhea. Delirium, either documented by a geriatrician or reported as an acute change in mental status or lethargy, was noted. Fever, defined as any recorded temperature of greater than or equal to 100 F, was documented from the vital sign reports.\nWe obtained information on clinical symptoms and outcomes following a positive test, including vomiting, diarrhea, delirium, and anorexia. The total number of calendar days with fever, the need for supplemental oxygen, hospitalization, and falls (during the 3 days before testing or any time during follow-up) were recorded. Symptoms were evaluated until death, or until 21 calendar days following the first positive test or end of study follow-up (May 8, 2020).\nResident Characteristics\nWe collected information on resident characteristics including demographics such as age, sex, and race using the MDS assessment between December 2019 and February 2020. The MDS is a federally mandated clinical assessment completed on all nursing home residents at the time of admission and quarterly thereafter. Information on clinical characteristics including cognitive function, as measured by the validated Cognitive Performance Scale, functional characteristics, body mass index, and behavioral symptoms, were also obtained. A frailty index (range 0-1, 1 indicates more severe frailty) was calculated using 35 items from the MDS, using a standard deficit accumulation approach. Variables used in construction of the frailty index include comorbidities, functional activities of daily living, sensory impairment, weight loss, and cognition.\nStaff Community of Residence\nStaff typically provide care on a single unit and rarely float between units. We obtained a list of the home zip codes for all nurses and personal care assistants. Zip codes were used to determine the rate of COVID-19 infection in each staff member's community of residence. Rates of infection were obtained from publicly available websites through May 7, 2020. A community was considered to have a high infection rate if the rate was in the top decile of COVID-19 rates for the state of Massachusetts (&gt;=1277 cases/100,000 persons). Staff members represent a total of 368 persons with 91 distinct zip codes. The aggregated distribution and range of COVID-19 cases in the state and community where staff members live is listed in Supplementary Table 1.\nStatistical Analysis\nWe described resident characteristics overall, and according to COVID-19 testing results, comparing with chi2 or t-tests for categorical and continuous variables, respectively Among patients who tested positive, we described clinical characteristics at presentation and clinical outcomes, including all-cause mortality. The clinical characteristic results were stratified by frailty status, categorized by calculated frailty index: Pre-frail (&lt;0.25), mildly frail (0.25-0.34), or moderate-severely frail (&gt;=0.35). A statistical comparison of clinical characteristics as categorical variables was done using a chi2 test. In a sensitivity analysis, we excluded residents who were diagnosed near the end of the study period and without the opportunity for 21 days of follow-up.\nThe proportion of residents testing positive for COVID-19 virus was calculated on each of the 8, long-term care units. Demographic and clinical characteristics of all patients on each unit were aggregated, regardless of COVID-19 status. We classified units as having a high burden of COVID-19 disease if &gt;50% of residents were affected, a moderate burden if 5%-50% of residents were affected, and a low burden if &lt;5% of residents were affected by disease. Comparison of resident characteristics and staff residence by unit were done using a 1-way analysis of variance. As a sensitivity analysis, we repeated our analyses including only those who died or had 21 days of follow-up (Supplementary Table 2).\nFinally, we developed a regression model of COVID-19 infection using the modified Poisson concept, with estimation of relative risks and associated 95% confidence intervals by generalized estimating equations using a log link function.

Other symptoms that were reported in less than 5% of residents included red eyes, abdominal pain, sore throat, tachycardia, shortness of breath, or unsteady gait. Delirium was documented in 18.6% of residents at the time of the positive test. Sixty-six residents (45.5%) were asymptomatic at the time of the positive test. Clinical symptoms at the time of presentation were similar according to frailty status with the exception that fever was more common in residents with mild (28.9%) or moderate to severe frailty (26.9%) as opposed to prefrail residents (4.9%, P = .01).\nThe most common clinical symptoms reported during follow-up were anorexia (71.0%) and delirium (57.9%). Fifty-eight residents (40.0%) developed an oxygen requirement, and 22 residents (15.1%) experienced a fall during the 3 days before diagnosis or during follow-up. The mean number of days of fever was 1.8 (range 0-9). Nine residents (6.5%) were hospitalized. Twenty-one (15.0%) residents remained asymptomatic during follow-up, and an additional 8.8% residents had no symptom except anorexia during follow-up. During a median follow-up time of 21 days, 44 (30.1%) of residents with COVID-19 disease died. The proportion of residents who died from COVID-19 increased as frailty severity increased (16.7% in prefrail, 22.2% in moderately frail, and 50.0% in frail; P &lt; .001).

The proportion of staff living in a community with a high rate of COVID-19 was also a significant predictor of testing positive [relative risk (RR) 1.06, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.05, 1.08]. In the adjusted model, 2 clinical characteristics were associated with an increased risk of testing positive for COVID-19: male sex (RR 1.80, 95% CI 1.07, 3.05) and bowel incontinence (RR 1.97, 95% CI 1.10, 3.52). Staff residence was a significant predictor of disease: for every 10% increase in the number of staff who live in a high prevalence community, the risk of testing positive for COVID-19 increased by 6% (95% CI 1.04, 1.08).\nDiscussion\nThis retrospective cohort study of a large, long-term care facility underscores the devastating effect this virus may have in long-term care facilities and nursing homes. More than 40% of long-term care residents who were COVID-19 positive were asymptomatic at the time of testing and many never developed any symptoms. Among those presenting with symptoms, cough, fever, and delirium were most common, and 44 (30.1%) residents died. Across the long-term care units, there was considerable variation in the burden of infected residents. Predictors of testing positive for COVID-19 included male sex, bowel incontinence, and a greater proportion of staff members living in a community with a high rate of COVID-19 infection.\nOur results demonstrate that even in a frail, long-term care population, the prevalence of asymptomatic carriers of COVID-19 is substantial (45.5%). In a study of 89 nursing home residents in Washington State, 56% of residents who tested positive for COVID-19 were asymptomatic at diagnosis, but only 3 out of 27 residents (11.1%) remained asymptomatic 1 week after diagnosis using a prospective symptom survey. We found a slightly greater proportion of residents remained asymptomatic over 3 weeks: 15.0% were asymptomatic and an additional 8.8% experienced only transient anorexia. Without universal testing, asymptomatic residents would go undiagnosed and may continue to spread the disease. It is challenging to prevent spread of the virus in long-term care given the high prevalence of moderate to severe cognitive impairment. Often, these patients are unable to adhere to infection control guidelines (eg, frequent handwashing, mask wearing), or safely isolate themselves. Ideally, residents with behavioral symptoms and COVID-19 should be managed in a designated unit.\nAmong symptomatic patients, delirium was one of the most common presenting clinical symptoms of COVID-19 infection. Atypical presentations of other infectious diseases, such as delirium with urinary tract infections, have been well described in frail, older adults and long-term care residents. Case reports of atypical presentations of COVID-19 include delirium as a presenting symptom, and a high prevalence of delirium has been reported among patients with COVID-19 in intensive care units. A case-series of hospitalized patients from Wuhan, China with COVID-19 infection reported 7.5% experienced impaired consciousness or delirium. In the Washington nursing home study, 25% of residents had altered mental status at the time of diagnosis. Although we found a higher overall prevalence of delirium in our study (55.9% at any time during illness), we suspect delirium was underreported. We also found that falls were prevalent. Increased surveillance of delirium and falls in the nursing home using standardized tools may be beneficial to clinicians, administrators, and policy makers interested in the mitigating morbidity of COVID-19 within a facility.\nPrevious reports suggest that COVID-19 transmission in nursing homes may be associated with poor quality of care or shortages of personal protective equipment. Our facility implemented the same infection control procedures across all long-term care units, yet we found that the prevalence of COVID-19 disease varied widely. Predictors of testing positive for COVID-19 included male sex and bowel incontinence. There have been a number of theories proposed for why men are more vulnerable, including androgen promotion of TPRSS2, a serine protease that promotes SARS-CoV2 penetration into host cells, X-linked genetic differences, or differences in the innate and adaptive immune function between men and women. Direct care staff must have close, prolonged contact to assist patients with bowel incontinence, which may place these residents at greatest risk.\nThe community where staff lived was also a significant predictor of disease. A recent study of surveillance testing among more than 15,000 staff members from assisted living facilities and skilled nursing facilities found that 92.4% of staff who test positive for COVID-19 were asymptomatic at the time of testing. Thus, staff members who reside in a community with a high burden of COVID-19 may inadvertently expose nursing home residents. Two recent studies are consistent with our findings: the strongest factors associated with COVID-19 outbreaks in nursing home facilities was larger facility size and geography.   To put our findings in context, in a facility with 50 direct care staff, for every 5 staff members who live in a community with a high burden of COVID-19, each resident's risk of contracting COVID-19 increases by 6%. Rates of COVID-19 in the communities where staff resided reflect a broad prevalence comparable to Massachusetts state data (Supplementary Table 1), and it is unlikely that single zip code outliers were responsible for our results. Together, these findings suggest that community prevalence of COVID-19 remains a major risk factor for nursing home outbreaks, and thus efforts directed toward mitigating outbreaks in nursing homes must additionally consider the broader community which they belong to.\nThere are weaknesses of our study. First, data on clinical characteristics was collected from retrospective chart review, and we suspect underreporting of some symptoms. Second, we did not have comprehensive staff testing during the study dates to directly determine COVID-19 status. We chose to collect zip code information on nurses and personal care attendants as the largest group of employees with direct patient contact. It is possible that some staff members had exposures apart from their local communities. Third, during the beginning of our study period, nurses and care attendants rarely worked on multiple units; however, during the later weeks of the study, staff illness necessitated some movement between units. This was kept to a minimum, and as most of our cases took place in the earlier half of the study, it was less likely to influence results. Fourth, our model to predict COVID-19 disease aggregated staff exposure at the level of the unit. The third and fourth limitation may result in some misclassification of staff residence. This should bias our results to the null, so the true association between staff residence and COVID-19 infection may be higher. Finally, our results are from a single, academic facility. Our patient population is older and has a greater burden of comorbidities than most community nursing homes. The overall census of our facility is equivalent to several nursing homes. Although resident characteristics differ across units, staffing is independent on each unit and infection control and admission policies are standardized across all units. Thus, our finding of differential infection prevalence across units strongly suggests that other nursing home residents who require a high level of care and live in a community with a high burden of COVID-19 are vulnerable.\nConclusions and Implications\nFirst, given the large number of asymptomatic carriers, universal testing of long-term care residents is strongly recommended. Second, standardized quick assessments for delirium may be useful in identifying early cases of COVID-19. Third, special attention should be given to residents with bowel incontinence, as the close, direct contact required to care for these residents may confer particularly high risk for the virus. Finally, because the community where staff live was a significant predictor of COVID-19 disease, early testing of direct patient care staff is recommended. As part of early response to the pandemic some cities and health systems offered alternative housing for healthcare workers. Allowing nursing home care workers to take advantage of such opportunities may be a strategy to reduce community exposure and potential introduction into the facility. Lastly, many states are now recommending universal testing of all nursing home workers, who provide direct patient care. Facilities with limited resources could consider prioritizing testing for staff in neighborhoods where COVID-19 is most prevalent.\nIn summary, despite the abundant precautionary measures initiated in a well-resourced long-term care facility, COVID-19 disease was prevalent in many of the long-term care units. More than 40% of infected residents were asymptomatic at the time of diagnosis, and many never developed symptoms. Male sex, bowel incontinence, and the community where staff lived were predictors of COVID-19 infection. Improved strategies to detect and mitigate spread of COVID-19 within long-term care facilities are urgently needed. We hope that our findings and implications will be informative as these strategies are being developed.\nReferences\n&quot;Abandoned&quot; nursing homes continue to face critical supply and staff shortages as COVID-19 Toll Has Mounted\nNursing home care in crisis in the wake of COVID-19\nNursing Home COVID-19 Data Inspection Results Available on Nursing Home Compare. 2020\nPresymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections and transmission in a skilled nursing facility\nDesigning the national resident assessment instrument for nursing homes\nMDS Cognitive Performance Scale\nA standard procedure for creating a frailty index\nMassachusetts Co. 2020\nCommission BPH. 2020\nHealth RIDo. 2020\nA modified Poisson regression approach to prospective studies with binary data\nAn atypical presentation of novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)\nAtypical presentation of COVID-19 in a frail older person\nA unique presentation of delirium in a patient with otherwise asymptomatic COVID-19\nCOVID-19: ICU delirium management during SARS-CoV-2 pandemic\nNeurologic manifestations of hospitalized patients with coronavirus disease 2019 in Wuhan, China\nSARS-CoV-2 cell entry depends on ACE2 and TMPRSS2 and is blocked by a clinically proven protease inhibitor\nThe lethal sex gap: COVID-19\nComparison of viral levels in individuals with or without symptoms at time of COVID-19 testing among 32,480 residents and staff of nursing homes and assisted living facilities in Massachusetts\nCharacteristics of US nursing homes with COVID-19 cases\nVariation in SARS-CoV-2 prevalence in US skilled nursing facilities\nSupplementary Data\nComparison of Aggregated State, Facility, and Unit Level COVID-19 Prevalence (Cases/100,000 Persons)\n	Massachusetts State	Entire Facility	High Prevalence Unit	Low Prevalence Unit	 	Range	0-5958	171-5958	380-3236	171-2601	 	Quartile - 25th	293	1069	1355	700	 	Quartile - 50th	478	1732	1882	1053	 	Mean	642	1704	1811	1240	 	Quartile - 75th	856	2148	2162	1732	 	\nPresence of Symptoms at Any Time for Overall Cohort vs Those With Full 21 Days Follow-Up\n	Total COVID-19 + Residents (n = 146) (%)	COVID-19 + with 21 d Follow-Up (n = 89) (%)	Prefrail FI &lt; 0.25 (n = 22)	Mild Frailty FI 0.25-0.34 (n = 34)	Moderate to Severe Frailty FI &gt;= 0.35 (n = 33)	P Value*	 	Days of Fever (mean +- SD)	1.8 +- 2.0	2.1 +- 2.1	2.4 +- 1.9	2.0 +- 2.2	2.1 +- 2.4		 	Delirium	83 (57.6)	53 (60.2)	12 (54.6)	19 (55.9)	22 (68.8)	.46	 	Anorexia	102 (70.8)	68 (77.3)	19 (86.4)	25 (73.5)	24 (75.0)	.50	 	Fall	22 (15.1)	16 (18.0)	7 (31.8)	5 (14.7)	4 (12.1)	.14	 	Required Oxygen	58 (40.0)	37 (41.6)	9 (40.9)	11 (32.4)	17 (51.5)	.28	 	Hospitalization	9 (6.5)	4 (4.6)	1 (4.8)	1 (2.9)	2 (6.3)	.81	 	Death	44 (30.1)	31 (34.8)	5 (22.7)	9 (26.5)	17 (51.5)	.04	 	\nFI, frailty index; SD, standard deviation.\nP value testing chi2 difference by frailty status.\nThis work was funded by an award from the : R01 AG062492.

however, in 7 residents no symptoms were documented.\n\n Hospitalization rates for facility residents, visitors, and staff were 54.5%, 50.0%, and 6.0%, respectively.\n\n The case fatality rate for residents was 33.7% (34 of 101).\n\n As of March 18, a total of 30 long-term care facilities with at least one confirmed case of Covid-19 had been identified in King County.\n\n\nConclusions\nIn the context of rapidly escalating Covid-19 outbreaks, proactive steps by long-term care facilities to identify and exclude potentially infected staff and visitors, actively monitor for potentially infected patients, and implement appropriate infection prevention and control measures are needed to prevent the introduction of Covid-19.\n","id":"PMC7121761","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Massachusetts Medical Society","authors":[{"firstname":"Temet M.","surname":"McMichael","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Dustin W.","surname":"Currie","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Shauna","surname":"Clark","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Sargis","surname":"Pogosjans","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Meagan","surname":"Kay","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Noah G.","surname":"Schwartz","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"James","surname":"Lewis","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Atar","surname":"Baer","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Vance","surname":"Kawakami","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Margaret D.","surname":"Lukoff","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jessica","surname":"Ferro","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Claire","surname":"Brostrom-Smith","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Thomas D.","surname":"Rea","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Michael R.","surname":"Sayre","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Francis X.","surname":"Riedo","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Denny","surname":"Russell","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Brian","surname":"Hiatt","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Patricia","surname":"Montgomery","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Agam K.","surname":"Rao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Eric J.","surname":"Chow","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Farrell","surname":"Tobolowsky","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Michael J.","surname":"Hughes","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ana C.","surname":"Bardossy","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lisa P.","surname":"Oakley","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jesica R.","surname":"Jacobs","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Nimalie D.","surname":"Stone","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Sujan C.","surname":"Reddy","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"John A.","surname":"Jernigan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Margaret A.","surname":"Honein","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Thomas A.","surname":"Clark","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jeffrey S.","surname":"Duchin","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"COVID-19 in a long-term care facility : King County, Washington, February 27-March 9, 2020.","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Asymptomatic and presymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections in residents of a long-term care skilled nursing facility : King County, Washington, March 2020.","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Preparing for COVID-19: long-term care facilities, nursing homes","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Interim guidelines for collecting, handling, and testing clinical specimens from persons for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Symptoms.

provides an excellent description of how such changes occur.\n\n Given that cognition also changes with age, we wondered whether the same model might also describe the accumulation of errors in cognitive test scores in community-dwelling older adults.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this prospective cohort study, 8954 older people (aged 65+ at baseline) from the Canadian Study of Health and Aging were followed for 10 years.\n\n Cognitive status was defined by the number of errors on the 100-point Modified Min-Mental State Examination.\n\n The error count was chosen to parallel the deficit count in the general model of aging, which is based on deficit accumulation.\n\n As with the deficit count, a Markov chain transition model was employed, with 4 parameters.\n\n\nResults\nOn average, the chance of making errors increased linearly with the number of errors present at each time interval.\n\n Changes in cognitive states were described with high accuracy (R2 = 0.96) by a modified Poisson distribution, using four parameters: the background chance of accumulating additional errors, the chance of incurring more or fewer errors, given the existing number, and the corresponding background and incremental chances of dying.\n\n\nConclusion\nThe change in the number of errors in a cognitive test corresponded to a general model that also summarizes age-related changes in deficits.\n\n The model accounts for both improvement and deterioration and appears to represent a clinically relevant means of quantifying how various aspects of health status change with age.\n\n\n","id":"PMC2292725","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"BioMed

tissues from patients with benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH) and prostate cancer (PC) using new approach- ACE phenotyping, that includes evaluation of: 1) ACE activity with two substrates (HHL and ZPHL); 2) the ratio of the rates of their hydrolysis (ZPHL/HHL ratio); 3) the ratio of immunoreactive ACE protein to ACE activity; 4) the pattern of mAbs binding to different epitopes on ACE – ACE conformational fingerprint - to reveal conformational changes in prostate ACE due to prostate pathology.\n ACE activity dramatically decreased and the ratio of immunoreactive ACE protein to ACE activity increased in PC tissues.\n The catalytic parameter, ZPHL/HHL ratio, increased in prostate tissues from all patients with PC, but was did not change for most |BPH patients.\n Nevertheless, prostate tissues of several patients diagnosed with BPH based on histology, also demonstrated decreased ACE activity and increased immunoreactive ACE protein/ACE activity and ZPHL/HHL ratios, that could be considered as more early indicators of prostate cancer development than routine histology.\n Thus, ACE phenotyping of prostate biopsies has a potential to be an effective approach for early diagnostics of prostate cancer or at least for differential diagnostics of BPH and PC.\n","id":"PMC6824872","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Impact Journals

Hospitalization rates for facility residents, visitors, and staff were 54.5%, 50.0%, and 6.0%, respectively. The case fatality rate for residents was 33.7% (34 of 101). As of March 18, a total of 30 long-term care facilities with at least one confirmed case of Covid-19 had been identified in King County.\nConclusions\nIn the context of rapidly escalating Covid-19 outbreaks, proactive steps by long-term care facilities to identify and exclude potentially infected staff and visitors, actively monitor for potentially infected patients, and implement appropriate infection prevention and control measures are needed to prevent the introduction of Covid-19.\nOn December 31, 2019, China reported a cluster of pneumonia cases of unknown cause that would later be identified as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Patients with the illness, called coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19), frequently present with fever, cough, and shortness of breath within 2 to 14 days after exposure. As of March 23, 2020, there had been 332,930 confirmed cases of Covid-19 reported globally, and 14,510 deaths had been reported. In recognition of the widespread global transmission of Covid-19, the World Health Organization declared Covid-19 to be a pandemic on March 11, 2020. The first case of Covid-19 in the United States was diagnosed on January 20, 2020, in Snohomish County, Washington, in a person who had recently traveled to Wuhan, China.\nOn February 28, Public Health-Seattle and King County (PHSKC) was notified of a positive Covid-19 test result from a patient who had been admitted to a local hospital and tested on the basis of newly revised testing criteria from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The patient resided in Facility A, a skilled nursing facility with approximately 130 facility residents and 170 staff. When the initial case was confirmed on February 28, 2020, PHSKC and the CDC immediately began case investigation, contact tracing, quarantine of exposed persons, isolation of persons with confirmed or suspected Covid-19, and on-site enhancement of infection prevention and control. Some of the information obtained through the investigation was rapidly reported through a Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report.\nCase Report\nOn February 27, 2020, PHSKC was notified of a 73-year-old woman with cough, fever, and shortness of breath who resided in Facility A, in which a cluster of unexplained febrile respiratory illness was occurring. The index patient had symptom onset on February 19 and worsening respiratory status requiring supplemental oxygen for 5 days before she was transferred to a local hospital on February 24, 2020. At the hospital, she was found to be febrile (temperature as high as 39.6 C), with tachycardia, tachypnea, and hypoxemia (oxygen saturation, 83% while she was breathing ambient air). She became more hypoxemic over the next 24 hours, despite bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP), and was intubated on February 25, 2020, because of respiratory failure. A computed tomographic (CT) scan of the chest revealed diffuse bilateral pulmonary infiltrates. Her medical history included insulin-dependent type II diabetes mellitus, obesity, chronic kidney disease, hypertension, coronary artery disease, and congestive heart failure. She had no known travel or contact with persons known to have Covid-19.\nMultiplex viral respiratory panel and bacterial cultures (sputum and bronchoalveolar lavage) were unrevealing. The CDC testing criteria for Covid-19 had been recently revised to include severely ill persons for whom no cause had been identified. On February 27, an astute clinician requested Covid-19 testing on the basis of the new CDC criteria allowing testing in cases of severe, unexplained pneumonia despite the lack of an epidemiologic link and obtained nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs and a sputum specimen to test for SARS-CoV-2 by real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR). On February 28, 2020, results were positive, 9 days after symptom onset and 4 days after hospital admission. The patient died on March 2, 2020.\nMethods\nIn response to the travel-associated case of Covid-19 in neighboring Snohomish County, PHSKC activated its emergency response on January 20, 2020, and began active surveillance for Covid-19, focused on identifying cases of suspected and confirmed Covid-19 and tracing contacts. PHSKC collects data on demographics, clinical status, and results of laboratory testing gathered from Covid-19 case investigations into its local surveillance database and analyzes these data in combination with laboratory records and case reports obtained from the Washington Disease Reporting System.\nOn receiving notification on February 28 of the Covid-19 diagnosis for the index patient, who was a resident of Facility A, PHSKC immediately began an investigation of the cluster of Covid-19-like illness that was occurring in this facility. A CDC field team arrived on March 1, at the request of PHSKC, to assist with the investigation. Facility residents, visitors, and health care personnel with confirmed Covid-19 were interviewed by telephone to collect information on symptoms, severity, coexisting conditions, travel history, and close contacts with known Covid-19. Guidance related to self-isolation, self-quarantine, and testing for symptomatic close contacts was provided during interviews, as appropriate. If a case patient was unable to be interviewed (e.g., because the patient had been intubated), a proxy was asked to provide as many details as possible. Medical chart abstractions were performed to confirm information about underlying health conditions among facility residents with Covid-19.\nSpecimen collection and diagnostic testing were conducted in accordance with CDC guidelines. In brief, upper respiratory specimens (nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs) were collected with synthetic fiber swabs. Each swab was stored in a sterile tube with viral transport media between 2 C and 8 C before being transported to the Washington Department of Health Public Health Laboratory for diagnostic testing. Sputum was collected only when the person had a productive cough or when clinically indicated. Diagnostic testing was done in accordance with the CDC's SARS-CoV-2 rRT-PCR panel for detection of SARS-CoV-2.\nAs part of the intensive response, at least 100 long-term care facilities in King County were contacted by email on March 6, 2020, through a REDCap survey that was used to obtain information on residents or staff known to have Covid-19 or on clusters of influenza-like illness among residents and staff. Nonresponders were sent up to five reminders to complete the survey. In addition, countywide databases that capture all emergency medical service transfers from long-term care facilities to acute care facilities were reviewed on a daily basis for evidence of cases or clusters of influenza-like illness. Finally, routine passive surveillance for influenza-like illness clusters in long-term care facilities was used to identify possible Covid-19; reporting is mandated for a confirmed case of influenza or for two or more cases of influenza-like illness in a 72-hour period. All long-term care facilities with evidence of a cluster of respiratory illness were contacted by telephone for additional information, including information on infection-control strategies that were in place and on personal protective equipment (PPE) supplies. On the basis of this information, the long-term care facilities were prioritized according to risk of Covid-19 introduction, and the highest-priority facilities were visited by response personnel to perform diagnostic testing of those with influenza-like illness and to implement infection-control assessment, training, and support.\nResults\nOn February 28, 2020, four cases of Covid-19 were confirmed among residents of King County; 1 person had presumed travel-related exposure, and 3 were identified by testing hospitalized patients who had severe respiratory illness (e.g., pneumonia) and who had tested negative for influenza and other respiratory pathogens. One of these was the index patient from Facility A; one was a Facility A staff member. When the index case was identified on February 28, at least 45 residents and staff dispersed across Facility A had symptoms of respiratory illness; PHSKC was notified of this increase by the facility on February 27.\nAs of March 18, a total of 167 persons with Covid-19 that was epidemiologically linked to Facility A had been identified (Figure 1); 144 were residents of King County and 23 were residents of Snohomish County. Cases of Covid-19 occurred among facility residents (101 persons), health care personnel (50), and visitors (16) (Table 1). Among facility residents, 118 were tested; 101 results were positive and 17 negative. Most affected persons had respiratory illness consistent with Covid-19; however, chart review of facility residents found that in 7 cases no symptoms had been documented. Clinical presentation ranged from mild (no hospitalization) to severe, including 35 deaths by March 18. Reported dates of symptom onset ranged from February 15 to March 13. The median age of the patients was 83 years (range, 51 to 100) among facility residents, 62.5 years (range, 52 to 88) among visitors, and 43.5 years (range, 21 to 79) among facility personnel; 112 patients (67.1%) were women (Table 1). The hospitalization rates for residents, visitors, and staff were 54.5%, 50.0%, and 6.0%, respectively. As of March 18, the preliminary case fatality rate was 33.7% for residents and 6.2% for visitors; no staff members had died. Most (94.1% of 101) facility residents had chronic underlying health conditions, with hypertension (67.3%), cardiac disease (60.4%), renal disease (40.6%), diabetes mellitus (31.7%), pulmonary disease (31.7%), and obesity (30.7%) being most common. Of the coexisting conditions evaluated, hypertension was the only underlying condition present in 7 facility residents with Covid-19. The 50 health care personnel with confirmed Covid-19 worked in the following occupational categories: physical therapist, occupational therapist assistant, speech pathologist, environmental care (housekeeping, maintenance), nurse, certified nursing assistant, health information officer, physician, and case manager.\nThrough ongoing surveillance and outreach to provide technical assistance with infection prevention and control to long-term care facilities (e.g., nursing homes, assisted living), a total of 30 King County facilities with at least one confirmed Covid-19 case, including Facility A, were identified by March 18. Of the first 8 facilities affected after Facility A, at least 3 had clear epidemiologic links to Facility A (Figure 2). Two of the facilities with definitive epidemiologic links had staff working both at that facility and at Facility A; the third facility had received two patient transfers from Facility A. Information received from surveys of long-term care facilities and on-site visits identified factors that were likely to have contributed to the vulnerability of these facilities, including staff who had worked while symptomatic; staff who worked in more than one facility; inadequate familiarity with and adherence to PPE recommendations; challenges to implementing proper infection control practices, including inadequate supplies of PPE and other items (e.g., alcohol-based hand sanitizer); delayed recognition of cases because of a low index of suspicion; limited availability of testing; and difficulty identifying persons with Covid-19 on the basis of signs and symptoms alone. Examples of specific PPE challenges included an initial lack of available eye protection, frequent changes in PPE types because supply chains were disrupted and PPE was being obtained through various donations or suppliers, and a need for a designated staff member to observe PPE use to ensure that staff were consistent with safe PPE handling (e.g., not touching or adjusting face protection, primarily face masks, during extended use). Working collaboratively, state and local health departments and CDC staff provided five focused PPE trainings for facility staff, including donning and doffing demonstrations and practice, and three additional basic infection control visits, including hand hygiene assessments, audits of PPE use, and reviews of environmental cleaning and disinfection practices.\nDiscussion\nThe vulnerability of long-term care facilities to respiratory disease outbreaks, including influenza and other commonly circulating human coronaviruses such as the common cold, is well recognized. As this report shows, the spread of Covid-19 reflected the same vulnerability in at least one long-term care facility. In total, 167 confirmed cases of Covid-19 had been identified among residents, personnel, and visitors as of March 18, and 30 skilled nursing and assisted living facilities in King County had identified at least one confirmed case of Covid-19. Staff working in multiple facilities while ill and transfers of patients from one facility to another potentially introduced Covid-19 into some of these facilities. The transmission within Facility A and to other facilities in the area posed a serious threat to the medically vulnerable population residing within long-term care facilities and strained the local acute care hospitals. Although the use of vaccine and antiviral medications can be effective in reducing the spread of influenza in long-term care facilities, such interventions are not currently available for Covid-19. Residents and health care personnel at long-term care facilities are at risk for Covid-19 transmission and severe outcomes, particularly for residents who are predominantly at advanced ages and have underlying medical conditions. Publicly available information on staffing and quality measures shows no indication that baseline practices at Facility A placed residents at greater risk than residents at other similar facilities.\nThis investigation had a number of limitations. Not all residents and staff were interviewed and tested for SARS-CoV-2, which might have led to under-ascertainment of infections, particularly for those who were presymptomatic or asymptomatic. For example, at another facility (Facility B) that had a subsequent Covid-19 outbreak epidemiologically linked to Facility A, swabbing of all residents revealed that infections with low cycle threshold values (indicating a large quantity of viral RNA) occurred among some residents who did not have symptoms. There was not a complete roster of visitors to Facility A, and it is possible that some infections among visitors were also missed by these surveillance and investigation efforts. Because symptom onset dates were not available in many cases, the epidemic curve is presented by date of report; however, this does not adequately represent the timing of disease onset in the facility, given that the median time from symptom onset to diagnosis in this cohort was 8 days but had considerable variability. Finally, case ascertainment and testing ramped up after the outbreak was recognized at Facility A, but there could have been infections and transmission at other facilities in the area earlier.\nOn March 10, 2020, the governor of Washington implemented mandatory screening of health care workers and visitor restrictions for all licensed nursing homes and assisted living facilities. These strategies are coordinated and supported by public health authorities, partnering health care systems, regulatory agencies, and their respective governing bodies. Local and state authorities strengthened prevention and mitigation strategies targeting transmission of Covid-19 and other respiratory viruses in long-term care facilities that include screening and restricted access policies for visitors and nonessential personnel; screening of health care personnel, including measurement of body temperature and interviewing for presence of respiratory symptoms, to identify and exclude symptomatic workers; strategies for close clinical monitoring of residents; social distancing, including restricting resident movement and group activities; staff training on infection prevention and control and PPE use; and establishment of plans for county and state coordination of needs and contingency plans for acquiring PPE in anticipation of delays or interruptions in supply. In addition to education, hands-on training, and maintaining adequate supplies, facilities need to reinforce staff adherence to infection prevention and control practices with regular auditing and feedback from observation of staff workflow. Substantial disruptions, such as staff absenteeism and increased workload, may affect the consistency with which these practices are implemented and monitored. The impact of these policies in protecting long-term care facilities should continue to be evaluated, along with the role of serial testing strategies to identify infected staff or patients as testing reagents and supplies become more available.\nThe experience described here indicates that outbreaks of Covid-19 in long-term care facilities can have a considerable impact on vulnerable older adults and local health care systems. The findings also suggest that once Covid-19 has been introduced into a long-term care facility, it has the potential to spread rapidly and widely. This can cause serious adverse outcomes among facility residents and staff, which underscores the importance of proactive steps to identify and exclude potentially infected staff and visitors, early recognition of potentially infected patients, and implementation of appropriate infection prevention and control measures. Lessons learned from this initial cluster can provide valuable guidance for long-term care facilities in other parts of the United States.\nDisclosure forms provided by the authors are available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org.\nThe findings and conclusions in this report are those of the authors and do not necessarily represent the official position of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\nThis article was published on March 27, 2020, at NEJM.org.\nA data sharing statement provided by the authors is available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org.\nSupplementary Appendix\nDisclosure Forms\nData Sharing Statement\nReferences\nA novel coronavirus from patients with pneumonia in China, 2019.\nFirst case of 2019 novel coronavirus in the United States.\nCOVID-19 in a long-term care facility : King County, Washington, February 27-March 9, 2020\nThe REDCap Consortium: Building an International Community of Software Platform Partners.\nSevere respiratory illness outbreak associated with human coronavirus NL63 in a long-term care facility.\nInfluenza in long-term care facilities.\nAsymptomatic and presymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections in residents of a long-term care skilled nursing facility : King County, Washington, March 2020.\n.

P?&lt;?.\n01) was negatively correlated with the CT severity scores.\n The receiver?operating characteristic analysis demonstrated that area under the curve of CRP on the first visit for predicting severe COVID?19 was 0.87 (95% CI 0.10–1.00) at 20.42 mg/L cut?off, with sensitivity and specificity 83% and 91%, respectively.\n CRP in severe COVID?19 patients increased significantly at the initial stage, before CT findings.\n Importantly, CRP, which was associated with disease development, predicted early severe COVID?19.","id":"PMC7262341","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"John Wiley and Sons Inc.","authors":[{"firstname":"Chaochao","surname":"Tan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ying","surname":"Huang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ying","surname":"Huang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Fengxia","surname":"Shi","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Kui","surname":"Tan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Qionghui","surname":"Ma","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yong","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xixin","surname":"Jiang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xiaosong","surname":"Li","email":"lxsong0308@163.com","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1016/j.eclinm.2020.100375","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Eosinopenia and elevated C-reactive protein facilitate triage of COVID-19 patients in fever clinic: A retrospective case-control study","abstract":"Background\nCoronavirus disease (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is currently a pandemic affecting over 200 countries.\n\n Many cities have established designated fever clinics to triage suspected COVID-19 patients from other patients with similar symptoms.\n\n However, given the limited availability of the nucleic acid test as well as long waiting time for both the test and radiographic examination, the quarantine or therapeutic decisions for a large number of mixed patients were often not made in time.\n\n We aimed to identify simple and quickly available laboratory biomarkers to facilitate effective triage at the fever clinics for sorting suspected COVID-19 patients from those with COVID-19-like symptoms.\n\n\nMethods\nWe collected clinical, etiological, and laboratory data of 989 patients who visited the Fever Clinic at Wuhan Union Hospital, Wuhan, China, from Jan 31 to Feb 21. Based on polymerase chain reaction (PCR) nucleic acid testing for SARS-CoV-2 infection, they were divided into two groups: SARS-CoV-2-positive patients as cases and SARS-CoV-2-negative patients as controls.\n\n We compared the clinical features and laboratory findings of the two groups, and analyzed the diagnostic performance of several laboratory parameters in predicting SARS-CoV-2 infection and made relevant comparisons to the China diagnosis guideline of having a normal or decreased number of leukocytes (?9·5 109/L) or lymphopenia (&lt;1·1 109/L).\n\n\nFindings\nNormal or decreased number of leukocytes (?9·5 109/L), lymphopenia (&lt;1·1 109/L), eosinopenia (&lt;0·02 109/L), and elevated hs-CRP (?4 mg/L) were presented in 95·0%, 52·2%, 74·7% and 86·7% of COVID-19 patients, much higher than 87·2%, 28·8%, 31·3% and 45·2% of the controls, respectively.\n\n The eosinopenia produced a sensitivity of 74·7% and specificity of 68·7% for separating the two groups with the area under the curve (AUC) of 0·717. The combination of eosinopenia and elevated hs-CRP yielded a sensitivity of 67·9% and specificity of 78·2% (AUC=0·730).\n\n The addition of eosinopenia alone or the combination of eosinopenia and elevated hs-CRP into the guideline-recommended diagnostic parameters for COVID-19 improved the predictive capacity with higher than zero of both net reclassification improvement (NRI) and integrated discrimination improvement (IDI).\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe combination of eosinopenia and elevated hs-CRP can effectively triage suspected COVID-19 patients from other patients attending the fever clinic with COVID-19-like initial symptoms.\n\n This finding would be particularly useful for designing triage strategies in an epidemic region having a large number of patients with COVID-19 and other respiratory diseases while limited medical resources for nucleic acid tests and radiographic examination.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7196382","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Elsevier","authors":[{"firstname":"Qilin","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xiuli","surname":"Ding","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Geqing","surname":"Xia","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Heng-Gui","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Fenghua","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhi","surname":"Geng","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Luming","surname":"Xu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Shijun","surname":"Lei","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"An","surname":"Pan","email":"panan@hust.edu.cn","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lin","surname":"Wang","email":"lin_wang@hust.edu.cn","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zheng","surname":"Wang","email":"zhengwang@hust.edu.cn","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1001/jamacardio.2020.0950","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Association of cardiac injury with mortality in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in Wuhan, China","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1001/jamacardio.2020.1017","date":"2020-03-09","title":"Cardiovascular Implications of Fatal Outcomes of Patients With Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)","abstract":"This case series study evaluates the association of underlying cardiovascular disease and myocardial injury on fatal outcomes in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).\n","id":"PMC7101506","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"American Medical Association","authors":[{"firstname":"Tao","surname":"Guo","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yongzhen","surname":"Fan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ming","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xiaoyan","surname":"Wu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lin","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Tao","surname":"He","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Hairong","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jing","surname":"Wan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xinghuan","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhibing","surname":"Lu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1016/S0140-6736(20)30566-3","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Clinical course and risk factors for mortality of adult inpatients with COVID-19 in Wuhan, China: a retrospective cohort study","abstract":"Background\nSince December, 2019, Wuhan, China, has experienced an outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).\n\n Epidemiological and clinical characteristics of patients with COVID-19 have been reported but risk factors for mortality and a detailed clinical course of illness, including viral shedding, have not been well described.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this retrospective, multicentre cohort study, we included all adult inpatients (?18 years old) with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 from Jinyintan Hospital and Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital (Wuhan, China) who had been discharged or had died by Jan 31, 2020.

rampant paranoia), there is a concern that biomedical research as a profession is waning in the United States (see ”Rescuing US biomedical research from its systemic flaws” by Alberts and colleagues in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences).\n However, it is wonderful to discover something new and to tackle tough puzzles.\n If we could focus more of our effort on discussing scientific problems and doing research, then we could be more productive and perhaps happier.\n One potential solution is to focus efforts on small thematic institutes in the university structure that can provide a stimulating and supportive environment for innovation and exploration.\n With an open-lab concept, there are economies of scale that can diminish paperwork and costs, while providing greater access to state-of-the-art equipment.\n Merging multiple disciplines around a common theme can catalyze innovation, and this enables individuals to develop new concepts without giving up the credit they deserve, because it is usually clear who did the work.\n Small institutes do not solve larger systemic problems but rather enable collective efforts to address the noisome aspects of the system and foster an innovative community effort to address scientific problems.\n","id":"PMC4214771","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"The American Society for Cell

auditory perception, musical skill, and emotional responsiveness to music","abstract":"Williams syndrome (WS), a genetic, neurodevelopmental disorder, is of keen interest to music cognition researchers because of its characteristic auditory sensitivities and emotional responsiveness to music.\n However, actual musical perception and production abilities are more variable.\n We examined musicality in WS through the lens of amusia and explored how their musical perception abilities related to their auditory sensitivities, musical production skills, and emotional responsiveness to music.\n In our sample of 73 adolescents and adults with WS, 11% met criteria for amusia, which is higher than the 4% prevalence rate reported in the typically developing (TD) population.\n Amusia was not related to auditory sensitivities but was related to musical training.\n Performance on the amusia measure strongly predicted musical skill but not emotional responsiveness to music, which was better predicted by general auditory sensitivities.\n This study represents the first time amusia has been examined in a population with a known neurodevelopmental genetic disorder with a range of cognitive abilities.\n Results have implications for the relationships across different levels of auditory processing, musical skill development, and emotional responsiveness to music, as well as the understanding of gene-brain-behavior relationships in individuals with WS and TD individuals with and without amusia.\n","id":"PMC3744910","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Frontiers

solutions for implementing and managing medical registries as well as aggregate, reproduce, and access data sets from legacy formats and platforms to advanced standard formats and operating systems are crucial for both clinical healthcare and biomedical research settings.\n\n\nPurpose\nOur study describes a reproducible, highly scalable, standard framework for a device registry implementation addressing both local data quality components and global linking problems.\n\n\nMethods and Results\nWe developed a device registry framework involving the following steps: (1) Data standards definition and representation of the research workflow, (2) Development of electronic case report forms using REDCap (Research Electronic Data Capture), (3) Data collection according to the clinical research workflow and, (4) Data augmentation by enriching the registry database with local electronic health records, governmental database and linked open data collections, (5) Data quality control and (6) Data dissemination through the registry Web site.\n\n Our registry adopted all applicable standardized data elements proposed by American College Cardiology / American Heart Association Clinical Data Standards, as well as variables derived from cardiac devices randomized trials and Clinical Data Interchange Standards Consortium.\n\n Local interoperability was performed between REDCap and data derived from Electronic Health Record system.\n\n The original data set was also augmented by incorporating the reimbursed values paid by the Brazilian government during a hospitalization for pacemaker implantation.\n\n By linking our registry to the open data collection repository Linked Clinical Trials (LinkedCT) we found 130 clinical trials which are potentially correlated with our pacemaker registry.\n\n\nConclusion\nThis study demonstrates how standard and reproducible solutions can be applied in the implementation of medical registries to constitute a re-usable framework.\n\n Such approach has the potential to facilitate data integration between healthcare and research settings, also being a useful framework to be used in other biomedical registries.\n\n\n","id":"PMC3723676","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Public Library of Science","authors":[{"firstname":"Kátia Regina","surname":"da

development","abstract":"Rare disease registries (RDRs) are an essential tool to improve knowledge and monitor interventions for rare diseases.\n If designed appropriately, patient and disease related information captured within them can become the cornerstone for effective diagnosis and new therapies.\n Surprisingly however, registries possess a diverse range of functionality, operate in different, often-times incompatible, software environments and serve various, and sometimes incongruous, purposes.\n Given the ambitious goals of the International Rare Diseases Research Consortium (IRDiRC) by 2020 and beyond, RDRs must be designed with the agility to evolve and efficiently interoperate in an ever changing rare disease landscape, as well as to cater for rapid changes in Information Communication Technologies.\n In this paper, we contend that RDR requirements will also evolve in response to a number of factors such as changing disease definitions and diagnostic criteria, the requirement to integrate patient/disease information from advances in either biotechnology and/or phenotypying approaches, as well as the need to adapt dynamically to security and privacy concerns.\n We dispel a number of myths in RDR development, outline key criteria for robust and sustainable RDR implementation and introduce the concept of a RDR Checklist to guide future RDR development.\n","id":"PMC4015362","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"BioMed

lumbar spine surgery: changing behavior through physical therapy (CBPT) study protocol","abstract":"Background\nThe United States has the highest rate of lumbar spine surgery in the world, with rates increasing over 200% since 1990. Medicare spends over $1 billion annually on lumbar spine surgery.\n\n Despite surgical advances, up to 40% of patients report chronic pain and disability following surgery.\n\n Our work has demonstrated that fear of movement is a risk factor for increased pain and disability and decreased physical function in patients following lumbar spine surgery for degenerative conditions.\n\n Cognitive-behavioral therapy and self-management treatments have the potential to address psychosocial risk factors and improve outcomes after spine surgery, but are unavailable or insufficiently adapted for postoperative care.\n\n Our research team developed a cognitive-behavioral based self-management approach to postoperative rehabilitation (Changing Behavior through Physical Therapy (CBPT)).\n\n Pilot testing of the CBPT program demonstrated greater improvement in pain, disability, physical and mental health, and physical performance compared to education.\n\n The current study compares which of two treatments provided by telephone – a CBPT Program or an Education Program about postoperative recovery - are more effective for improving patient-centered outcomes in adults following lumbar spine surgery for degenerative conditions.\n\n\nMethods/design\nA multi-center, comparative effectiveness trial will be conducted.\n\n Two hundred and sixty patients undergoing lumbar spine surgery for degenerative conditions will be recruited from two medical centers and community surgical practices.\n\n Participants will be randomly assigned to CBPT or Education at 6 weeks following surgery.\n\n Treatments consist of six weekly telephone sessions with a trained physical therapist.\n\n The primary outcome will be disability and secondary outcomes include pain, general health, and physical activity.\n\n Outcomes will be assessed preoperatively and at 6 weeks, 6 months and 12 months after surgery by an assessor masked to group allocation.\n\n\nDiscussion\nEffective rehabilitation treatments that can guide clinicians in their recommendations, and patients in their actions will have the potential to effect change in current clinical practice.\n\n\nTrial

sites, allowing for cross-site collaboration.\n\n Each site used between four and 37 individual measures and five of the sites are validating the PhenX measures through comparison with other study measures.\n\n Self-administered and computer-based administration modes are being evaluated at several sites which required changes to the original PhenX Toolkit protocols.\n\n A network-wide data use agreement was developed to facilitate data sharing and collaboration.\n\n\nResults\nPhenX Toolkit measures have been collected for more than 17,000 participants across the PhenX RISING network.\n\n The process of implementation provided information that was used to improve the PhenX Toolkit.\n\n The Toolkit was revised to allow researchers to select self- or interviewer administration when creating the data collection worksheets and ranges of specimens necessary to run biological assays has been added to the Toolkit.\n\n\nConclusions\nThe PhenX RISING network has demonstrated that the PhenX Toolkit measures can be implemented successfully in ongoing genomic studies.\n\n The next step will be to conduct gene/environment

implementation, and policies for data use.\n\n In contrast to the conventional model of centralized data contribution, warehousing, and control, we design a self-scaling registry technology for collaborative data sharing, based upon the widely adopted Integrating Biology &amp; the Bedside (i2b2) data warehousing framework and the Shared Health Research Information Network (SHRINE) peer-to-peer networking software.\n\n\nMaterials and methods\nFocusing our design around creation of a scalable solution for collaboration within multi-site disease registries, we leverage the i2b2 and SHRINE open source software to create a modular, ontology-based, federated infrastructure that provides research investigators full ownership and access to their contributed data while supporting permissioned yet robust data sharing.\n\n We accomplish these objectives via web services supporting peer-group overlays, group-aware data aggregation, and administrative functions.\n\n\nResults\nThe 56-site Childhood Arthritis &amp; Rheumatology Research Alliance (CARRA) Registry and 3-site Harvard Inflammatory Bowel Diseases Longitudinal Data Repository now utilize i2b2 self-scaling registry

aimed to identify clinical characteristics and epidemiological factors associated with influenza among community-dwelling adults aged ?60 years presenting to emergency departments.\n\n\nMethods\nWe identified patients with influenza-compatible chief complaints presenting to emergency departments of six acute care hospitals in Ontario, Canada during the 2011/12 and 2012/13 influenza seasons.\n\n Clinical characteristics, medical history and demographics were collected by patient interview, chart review and by contacting vaccine providers.\n\n Nasopharyngeal swabs were tested for influenza using polymerase chain reaction.\n\n We modeled predictors of influenza using multivariable logistic regression models that compared individuals with and without influenza.\n\n\nResults\nOf 1318 participants, 151 (11 %) had influenza (98 A/H3N2, 12 A/H1N1, 4 A [not sub-typed], 37 B).\n\n In the multivariable model, clinical symptoms associated with influenza were cough (OR 6.4, 95 % CI 3.2, 13.0), feverishness and/or triage temperature ?37.2 °C (OR 3.0, 95 % CI 2.0, 4.7), 2–5 days from symptom onset to the emergency department visit (OR 2.2, 95 % CI 1.5, 3.2), and wheezing (OR 2.1, 95 % CI 1.3, 3.3).\n\n The effect of cough on influenza increased with older age.\n\n Epidemiological factors associated with increased odds for influenza included weeks when ?10 % influenza tests from provincial laboratories were positive (OR 5.1, 95 % CI 1.2, 21.7) and exposure to a person with influenza-like illness (OR 1.9, 95 % CI 1.3, 2.8).\n\n Among participants with influenza, only 47 (31 %) met the U.\n\nS.\n\n Centers for Disease Control and Prevention criteria for influenza-like illness (temperature ?37.8 °C and cough and/or sore throat).\n\n\nConclusions\nAs in younger adults, cough and feverishness are the two symptoms most predictive of influenza in the elderly.\n\n Current influenza-like illness definitions did not adequately capture influenza in older adults.\n\n\n","id":"PMC5084347","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"BioMed
