We estimated associations between preexisting diagnoses and hospitalized COVID-19 alone or with mortality, in a large community cohort.\nMethods\nUK Biobank (England) participants with baseline assessment 2006-2010, followed in hospital discharge records to 2017 and death records to 2020. Demographic and preexisting common diagnoses association tested with hospitalized laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 (March 16 to April 26, 2020), alone or with mortality, in logistic models.\nResults\nOf 269 070 participants aged older than 65, 507 (0.2%) became COVID-19 hospital inpatients, of which 141 (27.8%) died. Common comorbidities in hospitalized inpatients were hypertension (59.6%), history of fall or fragility fractures (29.4%), coronary heart disease (21.5%), type 2 diabetes (type 2, 19. 9%), and asthma (17.6%). However, in models adjusted for comorbidities, age group, sex, ethnicity, and education, preexisting diagnoses of dementia, type 2 diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, pneumonia, depression, atrial fibrillation, and hypertension emerged as independent risk factors for COVID-19 hospitalization, the first 5 remaining statistically significant for related mortality. Chronic kidney disease and asthma were risk factors for COVID-19 hospitalization in women but not men.\nConclusions\nThere are specific high-risk preexisting comorbidities for COVID-19 hospitalization and related deaths in community-based older men and women. These results do not support simple age-based targeting of the older population to prevent severe COVID-19 infections.\nThe 2019 novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-19) presents with a wide spectrum of clinical disease presentations, from asymptomatic infection to respiratory failure with high mortality. However, little is known about what predicts hospitalization or mortality with COVID-19 in different individuals.\nThe majority of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 are older and have underlying medical conditions, with increased age being associated with clinical severity, including case fatality. The most frequent comorbidities reported in Chinese COVID-19 patient cohorts were hypertension (21.1%, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 13.0%-27.2%), diabetes (9.7%, 95% CI: 7.2%-12.2%), cardiovascular disease (8.4%, 95% CI: 3.8%-13.8%), and respiratory system disease (1.5%, 95% CI: 0.9%-2.1%), whereas in a large US cohort common comorbidities were hypertension (56.6%), obesity (41.7%), and diabetes (33.8%). Data on common comorbidities in hospitalized patients are important for understanding the acute treatment challenge, but it is unclear whether these conditions are common in COVID-19 hospital inpatients merely because they are also common in the older population. To identify those living in the community who are at most risk of hospitalization with COVID-19 (alone or with mortality), data are needed on which preexisting conditions are disproportionately common in such inpatients compared to the background population.\nUK Biobank (UKB) is a community-based cohort of 500 000 participants currently aged 48-86. Electronic linkage between UKB records and National Health Service COVID-19 laboratory test results in England are available from March 16 to April 26, 2020, thus including the peak of daily COVID-19 laboratory-confirmed cases in the current outbreak. During this period, testing of older groups was largely restricted to hospital inpatients with clinical signs of infection, so test positivity is considered a good marker of severe COVID-19. Given the scarcity of cohort data on risk factors for hospitalized COVID-19 in older groups, including those who died, we analyzed baseline (2006-2010) demographic characteristics and preexisting diagnoses during UKB follow-up. Identifying the specific risk factors explaining why some older people in the community were hospitalized with COVID-19 (of whom a subset died) may give clues to underlying vulnerabilities and are critical to developing outbreak control policies that focus on individual risk and avoid imposing crude age-based public health controls.\nMethod\nUKB Cohort\nThe UKB consists of more than 500 000 community volunteers aged 40-70 years at baseline (2006-2010), living close to 22 assessment centers in England, Scotland, and Wales. Baseline assessments included demographics, lifestyle, and disease history, with linkages to electronic medical records. UK Biobank ethical approval was from the North West Multi-centre Research Ethics Committee. The current analysis was approved under the UKB application 14631 (PI, D.M.).\nCOVID-19 Test Status and Sample Selection\nData were from UKB participants with linked data on COVID-19 infection (by polymerase chain reaction) from tests performed between March 16 and April 26, 2020, in England only and linked data on death records to April 26, 2020. We excluded participants who tested positive for COVID-19 but were not recorded as being hospital inpatients on the test sample submitted to the laboratory. We restricted analyses to participants aged 65 years and older when tested (or age on April 26, 2020 if not tested), to minimize misclassification of disease severity from health care workers. We also excluded UKB participants reported to have died before the pandemic (set as February 1, 2020). No COVID-19 test data were available for UKB assessment centers in Scotland and Wales, so data from these centers were not included. Our outcomes of interest were (a) COVID-19 test positive compared to the rest of the sample (ie, test negative and untested samples) and (b) COVID-19 test positive and died versus the rest of the sample, but with the additional exclusion of participants testing positive but who were still alive (see Figure 1 for details of UKB participants included in the analyses).\nFlowchart of UK Biobank participants selected for analyses.\nDisease Ascertainment\nPreexisting diagnoses were available from baseline questionnaires (2006-2010) eliciting participant reports of doctor-diagnosed disease. New disease diagnoses since baseline were from linked electronic medical records to hospital inpatient routine data (to March 2017), coded according to the International Classification of Diseases 10th revision (ICD-10). Diagnoses included were coronary heart disease (CHD), atrial fibrillation, stroke, hypertension, diabetes (type 2), chronic kidney disease (CKD, stages 3-5), depression, dementia, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), osteoporosis, and osteoarthritis. We also identified previous diagnoses of delirium, pneumonia, and falls or fragility fractures (see definitions in Supplementary Table 1). We combined each diagnosis reported at baseline or from linked hospital data to generate preexisting diagnosis status for each participant.\nStatistical Analysis\nWe estimated associations of demographic and diagnoses with inpatient COVID-19 test positivity (alone or with mortality) using logistic regression models, with 95% CIs. Logistic models were adjusted for age group (in 5-year bands), sex, ethnicity, education, and assessment center at baseline (to account for geographic differences in the prevalence of COVID-19 infection). We performed subgroup analyses stratified by sex and tested for interaction terms by sex. We also performed sensitivity analyses, comparing inpatient COVID-19 test positives with those testing negative. A p value smaller than 5% was considered statistically significant. All the statistical analyses were performed in Stata version 15.1.\nResults\nThere were 269 070 older adults (aged 65-86 years, mean 73.1 years) eligible for the analysis, of whom 507 (0.2%) were laboratory test-positive COVID-19 hospital inpatients, including 141 (27.8%) certified to have died. Rates of COVID-19 hospitalization varied widely across UKB baseline assessment centers (0.34%-0.07%; Supplementary Table 2). The mean age of COVID-19 test-positive inpatients (Table 1) was 74.3 years (SD 4.5), versus 73.1 years (SD 4.4) for other study participants. Both inpatients and others were predominantly of &quot;white&quot; ethnicity, but people self-reporting &quot;black&quot; ethnicity made up 3.6% of inpatients but only 1% of participants. The most common preexisting diagnoses in inpatients were hypertension (59.6%), a history of falls or fragility fractures (29.4%), CHD (21.5%), diabetes (type 2, 19.9%), and asthma (17.6%). Dementia was present in 2.8% of inpatients (0.3% of other participants). COVID-19 inpatients had a mean of 2.3 preexisting diagnoses (of a possible 15 examined) compared to other participants with mean 1.4 diagnoses.\nDescriptive Characteristics of UK Biobank Cohort by Inpatient COVID-19 Test Positivity\n	Inpatient COVID-19 Positive Test	Rest of the Cohort	 		Men	Women	Total	Men	Women	Total	 	Total number 	311	196	507	121 096	147 467	268 563	 	Dead	95 (30.6)	46 (23.5)	141 (27.8)	471 (0.4)	344 (0.2)	815 (0.3)	 	Age (years), mean (SD)	74.7 (4.4)	73.6 (4.6)	74.3 (4.5) 	73.3 (4.4)	73.0 (4.4)	73.1 (4.4) 	 	 65-69	46 (14.8)	51 (26.0)	97 (19.1)	31 522 (26.0)	41 174 (27.9)	72 696 (27.1)	 	 70-74	102 (32.8)	64 (32.7)	166 (32.7)	44 117 (36.4)	55 532 (37.7)	99 649 (37.1)	 	 75-79	132 (42.4)	65 (33.2)	197 (38.9)	37 642 (31.3)	42 138 (28.6)	79 780 (29.7)	 	 80+	31 (10.0)	16 (8.2)	47 (9.3)	7815 (6.5)	8623 (5.9)	16 438 (6.1)	 	Ethnicity							 	 White	282 (92.2)	171 (87.7)	453 (90.4)	115 714 (96.2)	141 152 (96.1)	256 866 (96.2)	 	 Black	10 (3.3)	8 (4.1)	18 (3.6)	1108 (0.9)	1618 (1.1)	2726 (1.0)	 	 South Asian	6 (2.0)	11 (5.6)	17 (3.4)	2204 (1.8)	1996 (1.4)	4200 (1.6)	 	 Other (including mixed and Chinese)	8 (2.6)	5 (2.6)	13 (2.6)	1278 (1.1)	2057 (1.4)	3335 (1.3)	 	Education							 	 None	119 (40.2)	75 (39.3)	194 (39.8)	25 008 (21.1)	32 786 (22.7)	57 794 (22.0)	 	 School/College	71 (24.0)	52 (27.2)	123 (25.3)	37 172 (31.4)	48 430 (33.6)	85 602 (32.6)	 	 Professional qualification	45 (15.2)	26 (13.6)	71 (14.6)	17 763 (15.0)	24 001 (16.6)	41 764 (15.9)	 	 Degree	61 (20.6)	38 (19.9)	99 (20.3)	38 514 (32.5)	39 044 (27.1)	77 558 (29.5)	 	Prevalent disease*							 	 CHD	80 (25.7)	29 (14.8)	109 (21.5)	19 986 (16.5)	10 949 (7.4)	30 935 (11.5)	 	 Atrial fibrillation 	53 (17.0)	15 (7.7)	68 (13.4)	9164 (7.6)	5097 (3.5)	14 261 (5.3)	 	 Stroke	15 (4.8)	8 (4.1)	23 (4.5)	3176 (2.6)	2227 (1.5)	5403 (2.0)	 	 Hypertension	194 (62.4)	108 (55.1)	302 (59.6)	55 772 (46.1)	53 981 (36.6)	109 753 (40.9)	 	 Diabetes (type 2)	71 (22.8)	30 (15.3)	101 (19.9)	11 004 (9.1)	7518 (5.1)	18 522 (6.9)	 	 Chronic kidney disease 	10 (3.2)	13 (6.6)	23 (4.5)	1814 (1.5)	2061 (1.4)	3875 (1.4)	 	 Depression	38 (12.2)	35 (17.9)	73 (14.4)	6724 (5.6)	12 749 (8.7)	19 473 (7.3)	 	 Dementia	7 (2.3)	7 (3.6)	14 (2.8)	412 (0.3)	462 (0.3)	874 (0.3)	 	 Asthma	39 (12.5)	51 (26.0)	90 (17.6)	14 100 (11.6)	20 512 (13.9)	34 612 (12.9)	 	 COPD 	36 (11.6)	26 (13.3)	62 (12.2)	5790 (4.8)	5656 (3.8)	11 446 (4.3)	 	 Osteoporosis	9 (2.9)	15 (7.7)	24 (4.7)	1160 (1.0)	6309 (4.3)	7469 (2.8)	 	 Osteoarthritis	45 (14.5)	41 (20.9)	86 (17.0)	12 987 (10.7)	23 553 (16.0)	36 540 (13.6)	 	Previous disease/condition*							 	 Delirium	4 (1.3)	1 (0.5)	5 (1.0)	320 (0.3)	284 (0.2)	604 (0.2)	 	 Pneumonia 	40 (12.9)	18 (9.2)	58 (11.4)	5146 (4.3)	5051 (3.4)	10 197 (3.8)	 	 Falls/Fragility fractures	82 (26.4)	67 (34.2)	149 (29.4)	22 531 (18.6)	44 302 (30.0)	66 833 (24.9)	 	Number of above diseases (max 15), mean (SD)	2.3 (1.8)	2.4 (1.8) 	2.3 (1.8)	1.4 (1.4) 	1.4 (1.3)	1.4 (1.4)	 	Number of hospital admissions, mean (SD)	5.9 (10.4)	5.1 (7.2)	5.6 (9.3)	3.0 (9.3)	2.7 (5.8)	2.8 (7.6)	 	\n\nNotes: CHD = coronary heart disease; COPD = chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

Compared to those with degree-level education, having no education qualifications (OR = 2.52, 95% CI: 1.96-3.24, p = 5.80E-13) was associated with raised risks of COVID-19.\nRisk of Hospitalized COVID-19 and Mortality by Demographic Variables and Preexisting Diagnoses\n	COVID-19 Positive Inpatient	COVID-19 Positive Inpatient and Dead*	 		Demographics	Full Model	Demographics	Full Model 	 		OR (95% CI)	p Value	OR (95% CI)	p Value	OR (95% CI)	p Value	OR (95% CI)	p Value	 	Age (years)									 	 65-69	1.00		1.00		1.00		1.00		 	 70-74	1.17 (0.91-1.52)	2.30E-01	1.12 (0.86-1.45)	4.00E-01	1.24 (0.71-2.18)	4.50E-01	1.15 (0.65-2.02)	6.30E-01	 	 75-79	1.60 (1.24-2.06)	2.70E-04	1.40 (1.08-1.81)	1.00E-02	2.61 (1.55-4.39)	3.00E-04	2.16 (1.27-3.65)	4.30E-03	 	 80+	2.02 (1.41-2.89)	1.40E-04	1.60 (1.11-2.32)	1.20E-02	3.66 (1.87-7.18)	1.50E-04	2.65 (1.33-5.29)	5.60E-03	 	Sex									 	 Female	1.00		1.00		1.00		1.00		 	 Male	1.91 (1.59-2.29)	5.10E-12	1.79 (1.48-2.17)	2.50E-09	2.36 (1.65-3.39)	2.90E-06	2.12 (1.45-3.09)	1.00E-04	 	Ethnicity 									 	 White	1.00		1.00		1.00		1.00		 	 Black	3.17 (1.92-5.25)	7.20E-06	2.85 (1.71-4.74)	5.60E-05	3.32 (1.42-7.77)	5.70E-03	2.60 (1.09-6.19)	3.00E-02	 	 South Asian	2.01 (1.20-3.36)	8.30E-03	1.69 (1.00-2.85)	5.00E-02	1.63 (0.59-4.51)	3.50E-01	1.20 (0.42-3.36)	7.40E-01	 	 Other (including mixed and Chinese)	2.22 (1.24-3.98)	7.50E-03	2.00 (1.11-3.61)	2.00E-02	No observations		No observations		 	Education									 	 Degree	1.00		1.00		1.00		1.00		 	 Professional qualification	1.40 (1.03-1.91)	3.40E-02	1.31 (0.96-1.79)	8.80E-02	1.66 (0.93-2.97)	8.50E-02	1.51 (0.85-2.70)	1.60E-01	 	 School/College	1.20 (0.92-1.57)	1.90E-01	1.11 (0.85-1.45)	4.50E-01	1.23 (0.73-2.08)	4.30E-01	1.09 (0.64-1.84)	7.60E-01	 	 None	2.52 (1.96-3.24)	5.80E-13	2.06 (1.60-2.66)	2.70E-08	2.43 (1.49-3.97)	3.80E-04	1.82 (1.10-2.99)	1.90E-02	 	Prevalent disease 									 	 CHD			0.95 (0.74-1.21)	6.60E-01			0.86 (0.55-1.36)	5.30E-01	 	 Atrial fibrillation 			1.64 (1.24-2.17)	5.00E-04			1.63 (0.98-2.71)	5.80E-02	 	 Stroke			1.16 (0.75-1.81)	5.00E-01			0.93 (0.40-2.17)	8.70E-01	 	 Hypertension			1.38 (1.13-1.68)	1.70E-03			1.42 (0.96-2.11)	7.90E-02	 	 Diabetes (type 2)			1.73 (1.36-2.22)	1.20E-05			3.11 (2.06-4.71)	7.60E-08	 	 Chronic kidney disease 			1.49 (0.96-2.31)	7.30E-02			0.88 (0.35-2.24)	8.00E-01	 	 Depression			1.79 (1.37-2.33)	1.70E-05			1.78 (1.07-2.96)	2.70E-02	 	 Dementia			3.50 (1.93-6.34)	3.60E-05			7.30 (3.28-16.21)	1.10E-06	 	 Asthma			1.12 (0.87-1.44)	3.70E-01			0.59 (0.33-1.04)	6.70E-02	 	 COPD 			1.58 (1.17-2.15)	2.90E-03			1.91 (1.10-3.32)	2.20E-02	 	 Osteoporosis			1.40 (0.91-2.14)	1.20E-01			1.36 (0.58-3.17)	4.80E-01	 	 Osteoarthritis 			0.98 (0.77-1.26)	8.90E-01			1.08 (0.69-1.70)	7.40E-01	 	Previous disease/  condition 									 	 Delirium			1.14 (0.45-2.90)	7.80E-01			1.02 (0.23-4.58)	9.70E-01	 	 Pneumonia 			1.96 (1.45-2.64)	1.10E-05			1.88 (1.07-3.30)	2.80E-02	 	 Falls/Fragility fractures			1.10 (0.89-1.34)	3.80E-01			1.20 (0.82-1.76)	3.40E-01	 	\n\nNotes: CHD = coronary heart disease; CI = confidence interval; COPD = chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; OR = odds ratio.

Coronary heart disease prevalence, previously noted as common in COVID-19 inpatients, did not differ between inpatients and other participants (OR = 0.95, 95% CI: 0.74-1.21, p = 6.60E-01) after adjustment for other diagnoses.\nIn logistic models for the risk of COVID-19 hospitalization and death, preexisting dementia was associated with the largest risk increase (OR = 7.30, 95% CI 3.28-16.21, p = 1.10E-06), followed by diabetes (OR = 3.11, 95% CI: 2.06-4.71, p = 7.60E-08), COPD (OR = 1.91, 95% CI: 1.10-3.32, p = 2.20E-02), pneumonia (OR = 1.88, 95% CI: 1.07-3.30, p = 2.80E-02), and depression (OR = 1.78, 95% CI: 1.07-2.96, p = 2.70E-02). Although prevalent atrial fibrillation and hypertension were significantly associated with COVID-19 hospitalization, these diagnoses did not reach a significance for being a COVID-19 inpatient and dying (p &gt; .05; Table 2).\nIn sex-specific analyses (Supplementary Table 4) of COVID-19 hospitalization, significant interactions by sex were only present for CKD (p = 4.20E-02) and asthma (p = 1.10E-02), which were both risk factors in women but not in men. For inpatient COVID-19 positivity and death, a significant interaction by sex was only present for CKD (p = 3.80E-02), which was a significant risk factor in women only.\nDiscussion\nWe aimed to identify risk factors in older UKB participants associated with hospitalization with COVID-19, alone or with mortality, during the peak of the initial epidemic in England. Preexisting diagnoses of dementia, type 2 diabetes, COPD, pneumonia, and depression, as well as atrial fibrillation and hypertension emerged as independent risk factors for COVID-19 hospitalization, the first 5 remaining statistically significant for related mortality. In addition, preexisting asthma and CKD emerged as risk factors in women for being hospitalized with COVID-19. Interestingly, CHD was common in COVID-19 inpatients and associated with COVID-19 in models adjusted for demographics only, but this association was no longer present after adjustment for comorbidities. In keeping with other studies, we also found an increased risk of COVID-19 in males, but we have shown that this risk is virtually unchanged after adjusting for comorbidities. In addition, we confirmed previous reports that people of black ethnicity and those with no educational qualifications had a higher risk. Overall, these results suggest that there are specific risk comorbidities in older groups and that severe COVID-19 susceptibility is not merely the result of advancing age.\nHypertension is well recognized as the most common chronic diagnosis, prevalent in more than 70% of persons at age older than 80. While highly prevalent in the UKB cohort, we found that it was only modestly more common in COVID-19 cases than in other UKB participants and not significantly associated with COVID-19 positivity and death. Interestingly, in females, we found that having a diagnosis of CKD (Grade 3-5) was associated with being COVID-19 positive (alone and with mortality), mirroring previous analyses by Masoli et al., who found that CKD grade is more predictive of mortality than blood pressure in adults aged older than 70. Chronic kidney disease has also been reported to be associated with increased hospitalization with infection, particularly pneumonia, and increased 30-day mortality.\nAnother novel finding is the association between atrial fibrillation and hospitalized COVID-19 positivity in the studied older adults and an association with COVID-19 positive and dead in men specifically. During atrial fibrillation, the loss of atrioventricular synchrony with decreased diastolic filling time is likely to lead to a decrease in cardiac output. Consequently, this low cardiac output may aggravate tissue hypoxia in COVID-19 patients. Also, agents used in the control of atrial fibrillation, particularly sotalol, propafenone, and nonselective beta-blockers, may cause bronchospasm. Pulmonary symptoms in COPD may become worse with atrial fibrillation development, due to excessive irregular heart rate, as well as the reduced diastolic filling of the ventricles. These factors may contribute to higher severe COVID-19 risk in participants with atrial fibrillation.\nTo date, there has been limited data on preexisting diagnoses of dementia and COVID-19 hospitalization, despite dementia affecting more than 50 million people worldwide. This may be due to the young median ages of many published COVID-19 case series, with a limited characterization of older persons. Our analysis confirms dementia to be the largest effect risk diagnosis in adults aged older than 65 for risk of hospitalized COVID-19 test positivity and death, in this cohort of community volunteers. A recent report of observational data from the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infections Consortium found a high prevalence of dementia in older adults admitted to hospital with COVID-19. Future work will need to establish whether this a direct effect of dementia pathologies or an indirect effect of high rates of infection in nursing homes. Recent studies have reported that the APOE e4 genotype (a risk factor for Alzheimer's disease) predicts severe COVID-19 and death, independent of preexisting dementia, but further work is needed to understand the biological mechanisms involved. Further work is also needed to establish the extent to which the observed association between depression and COVID-19 hospitalization is due to the depression itself or secondary to other diagnosed and undiagnosed physical pathologies.\nIn this analysis, we compared the characteristics of older COVID-19 inpatients to the rest of the study population, aiming to identify predictive factors for a severe infection that might be used to identify older people at higher risk in the community. An alternative analysis approach could compare COVID-19-positive inpatients (n = 507) to inpatients whose COVID-19 tests were negative (n = 596) during the study period (Supplementary Table 5). However, it should be noted that during the period studied at the epidemic peak, COVID-19 testing was largely restricted to hospital inpatients with symptoms of the infection, and the polymerase chain reaction test used had a significant false-negative rate of up to 29% on initial testing. Differences between test positives and negatives may therefore reflect other reasons for hospital admission with symptoms resembling COVID-19, plus false negatives. In the test-positive versus test-negative analysis (Supplementary Table 5), prevalent diabetes was associated with an increased risk, and a previous delirium episode was associated with a decreased risk of a positive COVID-19 test, and dementia and diabetes were associated with an increased risk of a positive COVID-19 test and death. As the statistical power to detect test-positive versus negative differences is far lower than in the comparison with the rest of the UKB sample, caution is needed in interpreting nonsignificant associations with the high-risk diseases identified in the main analysis.\nUK Biobank participants were somewhat healthier than the general population at baseline in 2006-2010, but the sample nevertheless includes large numbers of socioeconomically less privileged participants: for example, 36.1% of cases and 22.3% of controls had no educational qualifications (Table 1). Other limitations include the lack of details of degrees of clinical severity of COVID-19, beyond the ascertained measures of hospitalization and mortality. We do not currently have access to measures of COVID-19 exposure in the UKB sample or details of COVID-19 illnesses that did not result in hospital admission. During the peak of the epidemic, some patients with, for example, angina or even myocardial infarction may have been deterred from seeking medical help, which may possibly have influenced our finding of no association between CHD and COVID-19 hospitalization in fully adjusted models. However, CHD was more common in COVID-19 hospitalization on simple adjustment for demographics, with this association disappearing only after adjustment for other diagnoses. It may therefore be that common related comorbidities, for example, atrial fibrillation, hypertension, and CKD, are actually more predictive of COVID-19 hospitalization than preexisting CHD itself in older people. There may have been under ascertainment of inpatient COVID-19-related deaths in the data available for April 2020, but as the analyses for risk of COVID-19 positivity and death excluded participants who tested positive and survived, the impact on mortality associations is likely to be small. UK Biobank does not have data on care home residence, but the sample is relatively young (93.9% &lt;80 years), and at the peak of the epidemic hospital admission from care homes was restricted.\nOnly a small proportion of the English population had been exposed to the virus during the study period, but the group studied here was exposed and developed severe enough COVID-19 to be tested during hospitalization, with some of those dying. Our case group is therefore relevant for assessing risk factors for severe COVID-19 inpatients and death in this older population, but may not apply to asymptomatic or milder nonhospitalized cases. Our diagnostic data are derived from participant's baseline interviews plus hospital discharge data until March 2017, so under-ascertainment of disease is likely, especially for recently diagnosed conditions, but the similarity to previous reports of the common conditions seen in COVID-19 patients suggests that our data are valid.\nOur results should have implications for preventive interventions, encouraging a more targeted approach prioritizing those older adults with specific risk factors, rather than adopting policies that use chronological older age as a blanket indicator of risk. Our cohort evidence of specific risk factors may also help with avoiding potentially &quot;ageist&quot; approaches to setting clinical priorities in over-stretched health systems. Our findings of risks associated with less prominent conditions such as atrial fibrillation and depression, plus asthma and CKD in women only, could help focus clinical research. In addition, the prominence of depression as one of the major risk factors highlights the role of mental health as critical to managing the pandemic, including in older people.\nConclusions\nIn older adults, several specific preexisting comorbidities are disproportionally common in hospitalized COVID-19 male and female patients, alone or with mortality, notably including dementia, depression, atrial fibrillation, and CKD. Clinical and public health research is needed to establish the mechanisms involved and whether stratified interventions are needed for older patients with specific comorbidities. Our results do not support the simple age targeting of interventions to prevent severe COVID-19 infection.\nFunding\nUK Medical Research Council award MR/S009892/1 (PI, Melzer) supports J.L.A.

disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).\n\n Epidemiological and clinical characteristics of patients with COVID-19 have been reported but risk factors for mortality and a detailed clinical course of illness, including viral shedding, have not been well described.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this retrospective, multicentre cohort study, we included all adult inpatients (?18 years old) with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 from Jinyintan Hospital and Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital (Wuhan, China) who had been discharged or had died by Jan 31, 2020. Demographic, clinical, treatment, and laboratory data, including serial samples for viral RNA detection, were extracted from electronic medical records and compared between survivors and non-survivors.\n\n We used univariable and multivariable logistic regression methods to explore the risk factors associated with in-hospital death.\n\n\nFindings\n191 patients (135 from Jinyintan Hospital and 56 from Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital) were included in this study, of whom 137 were discharged and 54 died in hospital.\n\n 91 (48%) patients had a comorbidity, with hypertension being the most common (58 [30%] patients), followed by diabetes (36 [19%] patients) and coronary heart disease (15 [8%] patients).\n\n Multivariable regression showed increasing odds of in-hospital death associated with older age (odds ratio 1·10, 95% CI 1·03–1·17, per year increase; p=0·0043), higher Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score (5·65, 2·61–12·23; p&lt;0·0001), and d-dimer greater than 1 ?g/mL (18·42, 2·64–128·55; p=0·0033) on admission.\n\n Median duration of viral shedding was 20·0 days (IQR 17·0–24·0) in survivors, but SARS-CoV-2 was detectable until death in non-survivors.\n\n The longest observed duration of viral shedding in survivors was 37 days.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe potential risk factors of older age, high SOFA score, and d-dimer greater than 1 ?g/mL could help clinicians to identify patients with poor prognosis at an early stage.\n\n Prolonged viral shedding provides the rationale for a strategy of isolation of infected patients and optimal antiviral interventions in the future.\n\n\nFunding\nChinese Academy of Medical Sciences Innovation Fund for Medical Sciences; National Science Grant for Distinguished Young Scholars; National Key Research and Development Program of China; The Beijing Science and Technology Project; and Major Projects of National Science and Technology on New Drug Creation and Development.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7270627","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Elsevier Ltd.","authors":[{"firstname":"Fei","surname":"Zhou","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ting","surname":"Yu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ronghui","surname":"Du","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Guohui","surname":"Fan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ying","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhibo","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jie","surname":"Xiang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yeming","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Bin","surname":"Song","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xiaoying","surname":"Gu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lulu","surname":"Guan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yuan","surname":"Wei","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Hui","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xudong","surname":"Wu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jiuyang","surname":"Xu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Shengjin","surname":"Tu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yi","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Hua","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Bin","surname":"Cao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}],"References depth 2":[{"doi":"10.1001/jama.2020.1097","date":"1970-01-01","title":"The novel coronavirus originating in Wuhan, China: challenges for global health governance","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1101/2020.02.07.937862","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus: the species and its viruses:a statement of the Coronavirus Study Group","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Short term outcome and risk factors for adverse clinical outcomes in adults with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1056/NEJMoa2001316","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Early Transmission Dynamics in Wuhan, China, of Novel Coronavirus–Infected Pneumonia","abstract":"Background\nThe initial cases of novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV)–infected pneumonia (NCIP) occurred in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, in December 2019 and January 2020. We analyzed data on the first 425 confirmed cases in Wuhan to determine the epidemiologic characteristics of NCIP.\n\n\nMethods\nWe collected information on demographic characteristics, exposure history, and illness timelines of laboratory-confirmed cases of NCIP that had been reported by January 22, 2020.

coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) started in December, 2019, in Wuhan, China.\n\n Information about critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection is scarce.\n\n We aimed to describe the clinical course and outcomes of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this single-centered, retrospective, observational study, we enrolled 52 critically ill adult patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia who were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) of Wuhan Jin Yin-tan hospital (Wuhan, China) between late December, 2019, and Jan 26, 2020. Demographic data, symptoms, laboratory values, comorbidities, treatments, and clinical outcomes were all collected.\n\n Data were compared between survivors and non-survivors.\n\n The primary outcome was 28-day mortality, as of Feb 9, 2020. Secondary outcomes included incidence of SARS-CoV-2-related acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and the proportion of patients requiring mechanical ventilation.\n\n\nFindings\nOf 710 patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, 52 critically ill adult patients were included.\n\n The mean age of the 52 patients was 59·7 (SD 13·3) years, 35 (67%) were men, 21 (40%) had chronic illness, 51 (98%) had fever.\n\n 32 (61·5%) patients had died at 28 days, and the median duration from admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) to death was 7 (IQR 3–11) days for non-survivors.\n\n Compared with survivors, non-survivors were older (64·6 years [11·2] vs 51·9 years [12·9]), more likely to develop ARDS (26 [81%] patients vs 9 [45%] patients), and more likely to receive mechanical ventilation (30 [94%] patients vs 7 [35%] patients), either invasively or non-invasively.\n\n Most patients had organ function damage, including 35 (67%) with ARDS, 15 (29%) with acute kidney injury, 12 (23%) with cardiac injury, 15 (29%) with liver dysfunction, and one (2%) with pneumothorax.\n\n 37 (71%) patients required mechanical ventilation.\n\n Hospital-acquired infection occurred in seven (13·5%) patients.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe mortality of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia is considerable.\n\n The survival time of the non-survivors is likely to be within 1–2 weeks after ICU admission.\n\n Older patients (&gt;65 years) with comorbidities and ARDS are at increased risk of death.\n\n The severity of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia poses great strain on critical care resources in hospitals, especially if they are not adequately staffed or resourced.\n\n\nFunding\nNone.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7102538","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Elsevier

Approximately 9.2 million individuals aged 40–69 years who lived within 25 miles (40 km) of one of 22 assessment centers in England, Wales, and Scotland were invited to enter the cohort, and 5.5% participated in the baseline assessment.\n The representativeness of the UK Biobank cohort was investigated by comparing demographic characteristics between nonresponders and responders.\n Sociodemographic, physical, lifestyle, and health-related characteristics of the cohort were compared with nationally representative data sources.\n UK Biobank participants were more likely to be older, to be female, and to live in less socioeconomically deprived areas than nonparticipants.\n Compared with the general population, participants were less likely to be obese, to smoke, and to drink alcohol on a daily basis and had fewer self-reported health conditions.\n At age 70–74 years, rates of all-cause mortality and total cancer incidence were 46.2% and 11.8% lower, respectively, in men and 55.5% and 18.1% lower, respectively, in women than in the general population of the same age.\n UK Biobank is not representative of the sampling population; there is evidence of a “healthy

the GWAS Catalog includes &gt; 2800 human studies.\n Of these, only a minority have investigated the susceptibility to infectious diseases or the response to therapies for the treatment or prevention of infections.\n Despite their limited application in the field, GWASs have provided valuable insights by pinpointing associations to both innate and adaptive immune response loci, as well as novel unexpected risk factors for infection susceptibility.\n Herein, we discuss some issues and caveats of GWASs for infectious diseases, we review the most recent findings ensuing from these studies, and we provide a brief summary of selected GWASs for infections in non-human mammals.\n We conclude that, although the general trend in the field of complex traits is to shift from GWAS to next-generation sequencing, important knowledge on infectious disease-related traits can be still gained by GWASs, especially for those conditions that have never been investigated using this approach.\n We suggest that future studies will benefit from the leveraging of information from the host's and pathogen's genomes, as well as from the exploration of models that incorporate heterogeneity across populations and phenotypes.\n Interactions within HLA genes or among HLA variants and polymorphisms located outside the major histocompatibility complex may also play an important role in shaping the

decreased kidney function and renal replacement therapy (RRT).\n\n We thus compared the prevalence of decreased kidney function and RRT in the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) with a nationally representative survey and national registry.\n\n\nMethods\nAmong all people ?25 years of age registered in the CPRD for ?1 year on 31 March 2014, we identified patients with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) &lt;60 mL/min/1.73 m2, according to their most recent serum creatinine in the past 5 years using the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration equation and patients with recorded diagnoses of RRT.\n\n Denominators were the entire population in each age–sex band irrespective of creatinine measurement.\n\n The prevalence of eGFR &lt;60 mL/min/1.73 m2 was compared with that in the Health Survey for England (HSE) 2009/2010 and the prevalence of RRT was compared with that in the UK Renal Registry (UKRR) 2014.\nResults\nWe analysed 2 761 755 people in CPRD [mean age 53 (SD 17) years, men 49%], of whom 189 581 (6.86%) had an eGFR &lt;60 mL/min/1.73 m2 and 3293 (0.12%) were on RRT.\n\n The prevalence of eGFR &lt;60 mL/min/1.73 m2 in CPRD was similar to that in the HSE and the prevalence of RRT was close to that in the UKRR across all age groups in men and women, although the small number of younger patients with an eGFR &lt;60 mL/min/1.73 m2 in the HSE might have hampered precise comparison.\n\n\nConclusions\nUK primary care data have good external validity for the prevalence of decreased kidney function and

achieved through linkages to coded regional or national health care data.\n\n Our knowledge of the accuracy of such data is incomplete.\n\n To inform methods for identifying stroke cases in UK Biobank (a prospective study of 503,000 UK adults recruited in middle-age), we systematically evaluated the accuracy of these data for stroke and its main pathological types (ischaemic stroke, intracerebral haemorrhage, subarachnoid haemorrhage), determining the optimum codes for case identification.\n\n\nMethods\nWe sought studies published from 1990-November 2013, which compared coded data from death certificates, hospital admissions or primary care with a reference standard for stroke or its pathological types.\n\n We extracted information on a range of study characteristics and assessed study quality with the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Studies tool (QUADAS-2).\n\n To assess accuracy, we extracted data on positive predictive values (PPV) and—where available—on sensitivity, specificity, and negative predictive values (NPV).\n\n\nResults\n37 of 39 eligible studies assessed accuracy of International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-coded hospital or death certificate data.\n\n They varied widely in their settings, methods, reporting, quality, and in the choice and accuracy of codes.\n\n Although PPVs for stroke and its pathological types ranged from 6–97%, appropriately selected, stroke-specific codes (rather than broad cerebrovascular codes) consistently produced PPVs &gt;70%, and in several studies &gt;90%.\n\n The few studies with data on sensitivity, specificity and NPV showed higher sensitivity of hospital versus death certificate data for stroke, with specificity and NPV consistently &gt;96%.\n\n Few studies assessed either primary care data or combinations of data sources.\n\n\nConclusions\nParticular stroke-specific codes can yield high PPVs (&gt;90%) for stroke/stroke types.\n\n Inclusion of primary care data and combining data sources should improve accuracy in large epidemiological studies, but there is limited published information about these strategies.\n\n\n","id":"PMC4619732","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Public Library of

pressure (BP) was targeted to 120 mm Hg systolic compared with 140 mm Hg systolic in Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial (SPRINT); however, BP was measured using a research technique.\n\n SPRINT specified 5 minutes of seated rest in a quiet room followed by 3 oscillometric measurements without an observer in the room.\n\n The relationship of this research?grade methodology to routine BP measurements is not known.\n\n\nMethods and Results\nAmong 275 people with chronic kidney disease who had BP &lt;140/90 mm Hg when they came to the clinic, we measured BP as in SPRINT and recorded BP on the same day without specification of seated rest.\n\n Compared with routine measurement, the research?grade systolic BP was 12.7 mm Hg lower with wide limits of agreement (?46.1 to 20.7 mm Hg).\n\n Research grade systolic BP was 7.9 mm Hg lower than daytime ambulatory systolic BP and had wide agreement limits (?33.2 to 17.4 mm Hg).\n\n Whereas the routine, research?grade, and daytime ambulatory systolic BP were all related to echocardiographic left ventricular hypertrophy, the strength of the relationship between research?grade and daytime ambulatory systolic BP to left ventricular hypertrophy was similar and stronger than the strength of the relationship between routine systolic BP and left ventricular hypertrophy.\n\n\nConclusions\nTaken together, these results suggest that translation of the SPRINT results will require measurement of BP as performed in that trial.\n\n Instead of an algebraic manipulation of routine clinic measurements, the SPRINT methodology of BP measurement would be needed at minimum if implementation of the SPRINT results were to be deployed in the population at large.\n\n\n","id":"PMC5523757","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"John Wiley and Sons

While these symptoms arise acutely during the course of infection, less is known about the possible long-term consequences for the brain.\n Severely affected COVID-19 cases experience high levels of proinflammatory cytokines and acute respiratory dysfunction and often require assisted ventilation.\n All these factors have been suggested to cause cognitive decline.\n Pathogenetically, this may result from direct negative effects of the immune reaction, acceleration or aggravation of pre-existing cognitive deficits, or de novo induction of a neurodegenerative disease.\n This article summarizes the current understanding of neurological symptoms of COVID-19 and hypothesizes that affected patients may be at higher risk of developing cognitive decline after overcoming the primary

We urge UK research funding agencies to work with researchers, people with lived experience, and others to establish a high level coordination group to ensure that these research priorities are addressed, and to allow new ones to be identified over time.\n The need to maintain high-quality research standards is imperative.\n International collaboration and a global perspective will be beneficial.\n An immediate priority is collecting high-quality data on the mental health effects of the COVID-19 pandemic across the whole population and vulnerable groups, and on brain function, cognition, and mental health of patients with COVID-19. There is an urgent need for research to address how mental health consequences for vulnerable groups can be mitigated under pandemic conditions, and on the impact of repeated media consumption and health messaging around COVID-19. Discovery, evaluation, and refinement of mechanistically driven interventions to address the psychological, social, and neuroscientific aspects of the pandemic are required.\n Rising to this challenge will require integration across disciplines and sectors, and should be done together with people with lived experience.\n New funding will be required to meet these priorities, and it can be efficiently leveraged by the UK's world-leading infrastructure.\n This Position Paper provides a strategy that may be both adapted for, and integrated with, research efforts in other countries.\n","id":"PMC7159850","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Elsevier Ltd.","authors":[{"firstname":"Emily

failure of COVID?19 patients","abstract":"Following the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS?CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS?CoV), another highly pathogenic coronavirus named SARS?CoV?2 (previously known as 2019?nCoV) emerged in December 2019 in Wuhan, China, and rapidly spreads around the world.\n This virus shares highly homological sequence with SARS?CoV, and causes acute, highly lethal pneumonia coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID?19) with clinical symptoms similar to those reported for SARS?CoV and MERS?CoV.\n The most characteristic symptom of patients with COVID?19 is respiratory distress, and most of the patients admitted to the intensive care could not breathe spontaneously.\n Additionally, some patients with COVID?19 also showed neurologic signs, such as headache, nausea, and vomiting.\n Increasing evidence shows that coronaviruses are not always confined to the respiratory tract and that they may also invade the central nervous system inducing neurological diseases.\n The infection of SARS?CoV has been reported in the brains from both patients and experimental animals, where the brainstem was heavily infected.\n Furthermore, some coronaviruses have been demonstrated able to spread via a synapse?connected route to the medullary cardiorespiratory center from the mechanoreceptors and chemoreceptors in the lung and lower respiratory airways.\n Considering the high similarity between SARS?CoV and SARS?CoV2, it remains to make clear whether the potential invasion of SARS?CoV2 is partially responsible for the acute respiratory failure of patients with COVID?19. Awareness of this may have a guiding significance for the prevention and treatment of the SARS?CoV?2?induced respiratory failure.\n","id":"PMC7228394","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"John Wiley and Sons Inc.","authors":[{"firstname":"Yan?Chao","surname":"Li","email":"liyanchao@jlu.edu.cn","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Wan?Zhu","surname":"Bai","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Wan?Zhu","surname":"Bai","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Tsutomu","surname":"Hashikawa","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"The relationship between encephalitis lethargica and influenza: a critical analysis","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Human coronaviruses and other respiratory viruses: underestimated opportunistic pathogens of the central nervous system?","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Axonal transport enables neuron-to-neuron propagation of human coronavirus OC43","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Immunofluorescence studies on the pathogenesis of hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus infection in pigs after oronasal inoculation","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Cryo-EM structure of the 2019-nCoV spike in the prefusion conformation","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as a SARS-CoV-2 receptor: molecular mechanisms and potential therapeutic target","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus infection causes neuronal death in the absence of encephalitis in mice transgenic for human ACE2","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1101/2020.03.25.009084","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Non-neural expression of SARS-CoV-2 entry genes in the olfactory epithelium suggests mechanisms underlying anosmia in COVID-19 patients","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Evidence of the COVID-19 virus targeting the CNS: tissue distribution, host-virus interaction, and proposed neurotropic mechanisms","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Tissue distribution of ACE2 protein, the functional receptor for SARS coronavirus.

The clinical presentation of COVID-19 in subjects with dementia is atypical, reducing early recognition of symptoms and hospitalization.\nIntroduction\nIn Italy, SARS-CoV-2 outbreak was catastrophic with 135,586 confirmed cases and 17,127 deaths at April, 8th. In clinical series of patients who died of COVID-19 comorbidities (especially hypertension, cardiac ischemic disease, diabetes and obesity) were identified as significant risk factors for mortality, while dementia was described as a comorbid condition in only 6.8% of COVID-19 patients.\nAlthough dementia is known to be an important mortality risk factor among older people, so far there are no studies analyzing the role of dementia as a risk factor for mortality in patients affected by COVID-19.\nIn the Province of Brescia, an administrative district in eastern Lombardy home to 1.2 million people, between February 22nd and April 8th, 9,900 cases of Covid-19 have been diagnosed and 1,800 deaths have been reported. About 53% (2265 out of 4200) of hospital beds have been dedicated to treat patients affected by Covid-19 pneumonia. Specific units were created to cater to these patients: acute medical units, named COVID Wards, and intensive care units, with the last accounting fort the 8.5% of all the beds dedicated to COVID-19 patients.\nMethods and study population\nDuring this period, 627 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 pneumonia were admitted to our hospitals. All patients admitted to COVID Wards were positive to RT-PCR for SARS-Cov-2 conducted on a nasopharyngeal specimen and presented respiratory failure. Each patient underwent a thorough medical evaluation and, if over 65, a geriatric multi-dimensional assessment, comprehensive of evaluation of cognitive and functional status and presence of delirium.\nDementia was diagosed according to clinical history and results of the cognitive assessment. The modalities of onset of the COVID-19 infection, the symptoms of presentation at the hospital emergency department and the outcomes were recorded.\nResults\nDementia was diagnosed in 82 patients (13.1%). The mean age of patients diagnosed with dementia was 82.6 (SD 5.3; IQR 80-86), versus 68.9 (SD 12.7; IQR 60-68) in patients not affected by dementia (p&lt;0.001; Student's t test). Females were 47 (57.3%) among patients with dementia and 288 (52.8%) among patients not diagnosed with dementia, respectively.\nCharacteristics of 627 patients consecutively hospitalized for COVID19 pneumonia in two Italian hospitals according to the diagnosis of dementia\nCharacteristics	Sample	Dementia	no Dementia	p	 	No, (%)	627 (100)	82 (13.1)	545 (86.9)		 	Sex, No (%)					 	men	292(46.6)	35(42.7)	257(47.2)	NS*	 	women	335 (53.4)	47(57.3)	288(52.8)		 	Age, mean (SD), y	70,7 (12.9)	82.6 (5.3)	68.9 (12.7)	&lt;0.001**	 	Mortality, no (%)	194 (30.9)	51 (62.2)	143 (26.2)	&lt;0.001*	 	\n* Pearson's chi-squared test; ** Student's t-test\nThe mortality rate was 62.2% (51/82) among patients affected by dementia compared to 26.2% (143/545) in subjects without dementia (p&lt;0.001, Chi-Squared test). (Table 1) \nThe Clinical Dementia Rating Scale (CDR) was used to determine the severity of dementia: 36 patients (43.4%) were classified in stage 1, 15 (18.3%) in stage 2 and 31 (37.8%) in stage 3. The Mortality rates were, respectively, 41.7%, 66.7%, and 83.9% (p&lt;0.001, one-way ANOVA). (table 2)\nCharacteristics of 627 patients consecutively hospitalized for COVID19 pneumonia in two Italian hospitals according to CDR classification\nCharacteristics	CDR0	CDR1	CDR2	CDR3	p	 	No, (%)	545 (86.9)	36 (5.8)	15.

According to this model age, and the diagnosis of dementia resulted independently associated with a higher mortality. For every increased year of age, the Odds Ratio (OR) for mortality was 1.09 (95% CI: 1.07-1.12, p&lt;0.001), and patients diagnosed with dementia presented an OR of 1.84 (95% CI: 1.09-3.13, p&lt;0.05). According to this model sex was not associated with a change in mortality risk. (Table 3) \nSymptoms at ER admission among 82 dementia patients consecutively hospitalized for COVID19 pneumonia in two Italian hospitals\nSymptoms, No (%)	 	Delirium	55 (67.1)	 	Hypoactive	41 (50.0)	 	Hyperactive	17 (20.7)	 	Functional status worsening	46 (56.1)	 	Behavioral symptoms	9 (11.0)	 	Fever	39 (47.6)	 	Cough	11 (13.4)	 	Dyspnea	36 (43.9)	 	\nAs shown in table 4, among patients diagnosed with dementia the most frequent symptoms of onset were delirium (67%, especially in the hypoactive form, 50%) and worsening of the functional status. The classic symptoms of COVID-19 infection were less frequent: only 47% of patients had fever, 44% dyspnea and 14% cough. \nConclusions\nCaring for patients with dementia during the current pandemic is a complex task, involving the management of patients in different settings. Some patients need to be treated at home, often with caregivers burdened by isolation due to lockdown measures and by limitation of home services. Other patients are cared in nursing homes, which often lack adequate and trained staffs and access to personal protective equipment. Hospital patient's management has been difficult due to the scarce collaboration offered by the patient and difficulties in communication, immobility, and limited availability of trained staff members. There are also ethical concerns regarding hospitalization of patients with dementia due to resource constraints during the current pandemic.\nTo our knowledge, the proportion of subjects with dementia among patients admitted to an acute hospital for COVID-19 has never been evaluated. The prevalence of demented patient found in the present study (13.1%) is lower than the previous estimates of the prevalence of dementia in hospital, which vary from 15% to 42%. According to our data, the diagnosis of dementia, especially in the most advanced stages, represents an important risk factor for mortality in COVID-19 patients. The clinical presentation of COVID-19 in subjects with dementia is atypical, reducing early recognition of symptoms and hospitalization. We suggest that the onset of hypoactive delirium and worsening functional status in people with dementia may be considered a sign of possible COVID-19 infection during this epidemic. Early recognition of COVID-19 in demented people can help provide timely treatment and adequate isolation. Hospitals should develop integrated care models, create Special Care Geriatric COVID units and promote guidelines to ensure the better possible treatment for frail older persons.\nAll the authors contributed equally to the drafting of this manuscript.\nFunding: No funding.\nConflicts of interest/Competing interests: The authors declare that they have no conflict of interest.\nEthics approval: This is a review study; the protocol was approved by the institutional committee.\nReferences\nWord Health Organization.

Public health and healthcare professionals are at the frontline and work hard to control and mitigate the spread of the pandemic. With the deepening of the understanding of the disease, patients with COVID-19 in various special groups have gradually attracted attention, such as cancer patients, end-stage kidney disease patients, and pregnant women. Patients with mental disorders need long-term treatment and specialized care, and their health and psychological status are different from those of the general population. The double hit of mental disorder and COVID-19 in the pandemic has raised great concerns. However, little information about this special group has been reported.\nIt has been acknowledged that mental disorders are a diverse group of conditions that primarily impair cognition, emotion, and behavioral control. Mental disorders can occur early in life and have a high aggregate prevalence in all countries, especially in low- and middle-income countries. People living with mental disorders have limited access to or difficulties understanding public health information, which predisposes them to an increased chance of infection compared with the general population. Obviously, the double hit of mental disorder and COVID-19 in the pandemic leads to increased danger. Therefore, this study focused on the factors affecting the prognosis of patients with mental disorders (especially dementia) with COVID-19.\nRESULTS\nThe clinical and laboratory parameters of this study are given in Table 1. The cases of a total of 30 patients were reviewed, and patients were divided into the nonsevere symptoms group (n=19) and the severe symptoms group (n=11). There were significant differences in blood oxygen saturation (95.58+-1.02% vs. 88.45+-3.56%, P &lt; 0.01) and the incidence of certain clinical symptoms (anorexia/nausea, P = 0.02, and dyspnea, P &lt; 0.01) between the nonsevere symptoms group and the severe symptoms group. However, there was no significant difference in baseline data such as age, sex, the type of mental disorder, and heart rate (P &gt; 0.05).\nBaseline characteristics of mental disorders patients with COVID-19.\nClinical parameters	Nonsevere symptoms group (n=19)	Severe symptoms group (n=11)	ES	P	 	Age(years)	61.47+-14.74	66.73+-7.30	-1.01	0.28	 	Gender (n, Male/Female)	6/13	4/7	0.07	1.00	 	Maximum body temperature( C)	37.74+-1.05	38.09+-1.30	-0.82	0.42	 	Heart rate (bpm)	81.42+-9.78	88.55+-15.48	-1.55	0.13	 	Systolic pressure (mmHg)	128.53+-16.76	122.09+-11.16	1.13	0.27	 	Diastolic pressure (mmHg)	79.63+-8.45	77.91+-11.18	0.47	0.64	 	Blood oxygen saturation (%)	95.58+-1.02	88.45+-3.56	8.25	&lt; 0.01	 	History of basic diseases (n)					 	Hypertension	11	3	2.63	0.14	 	Chronic bronchitis	1	0	0.60	0.22	 	Atherosclerosis	4	4	0.84	0.36	 	Symptom (n)					 	Fever	11	8	0.66	0.42	 	Cough	9	9	3.45	0.06	 	Muscle soreness	0	1	1.79	0.18	 	Expectoration	3	2	0.03	0.87	 	Hemoptysis	0	0	-	-	 	Dizzy	1	2	1.29	0.26	 	Headache	0	0	-	-	 	Diarrhea	4	3	0.15	0.70	 	Fatigue	8	8	2.63	0.11	 	Pharyngalgia	0	0	-	-	 	Stuffy nose/Runny nose	0	0	-	-	 	Anorexia/Nausea	1	6	9.46	0.02	 	Dyspnea	1	10	22.00	&lt; 0.01	 	Lumbago	0	2	3.70	0.05	 	\nES=effect size\nWe regrouped the patients according to their final prognosis and divided the patients into the deceased group (n = 5) and the cured group (n = 25). There were significant differences in some clinical symptoms (fatigue, anorexia/nausea and dyspnea) and laboratory parameters (AST and BUN) between the two groups (P &lt; 0.05, Table 2). Surprisingly, the mortality rate of patients with dementia was significantly higher than that of patients with other mental disorders (P = 0.001, Table 2).\nUnivariate analysis based on the prognosis of patients.\nClinical parameters	Cured(n=25)	Deceased(n=5)	ES	P	 	Age (years)	62.72+-13.640	66.80+-5.070	-0.652	0.520	 	Basic mental illness (n)					 	Dementia	2	3	8.112	0.004	 	Nondementia	23	2			 	Gender (n)			1.920	0.166	 	Male/Female	7/18	3/2			 	Symptom severity (n)					 	Severe cases	6	5	10.364	0.001	 	Non Severe cases	19	0			 	Symptom (n)					 	Fever	14	5	3.474	0.062	 	Cough	15	3	0.000	1.000	 	Muscle soreness	1	0	0.207	0.649	 	Expectoration	5	0	1.200	0.273	 	Dizziness	2	1	0.667	0.414	 	Diarrhea	6	1	0.037	0.847	 	Fatigue	11	5	5.250	0.022	 	Anorexia/Nausea	4	3	4.509	0.034	 	Dyspnea	6	5	10.364	0.001	 	Blood routine					 	WBC (109/L)	5.877+-3.419	9.184+-6.720	-1.633	0.107	 	Neutrophil count (109/L)	3.978+-2.776	7.434+-6.743	-1.949	0.061	 	Lymphocyte count (109/L)	1.393+-0.680	1.180+-0.481	0.666	0.511	 	Monocyte count (109/L)	0.464+-0.301	0.454+-0.106	0.075	0.941	 	Hemoglobin (g/L)	125.640+-15.196	131.200+-7.050	-0.793	0.435	 	Platelet count (109/L)	180.720+-49.526	143.800+-34.172	1.582	0.125	 	Albumin(g/L)	37.550+-5.534	34.180+-0.838	1.199	0.241	 	Blood biochemistry					 	AST (U/L)	24.360+-12.086	49.250+-27.585	-3.157	0.004	 	ALT (U/L)	22.760+-13.758	31.250+-29.296	-0.971	0.340	 	TBil (umol/L)	7.396+-3.517	7.525+-1.611	-0.071	0.944	 	SCr(umol/L)	76.816+-43.071	111.180+-56.265	-1.552	0.132	 	BUN (mmol/L)	4.212+-1.613	9.060+-3.464	-4.984	&lt;0.001	 	UA (umol/L)	324.720+-97.053	351.800+-97.513	-0.569	0.574	 	\nES=effect size; TBil=total bilirubin; SCr=serum creatinine; BUN=blood urea nitrogen; UA=uric acid\nTo further explain this phenomenon, we compared the blood indexes of dementia patients and nondementia patients. The results showed that certain laboratory parameters in the serum of dementia patients were significantly increased (WBC count: 10.100 +- 6.147 vs. 5.694 +- 3.383, P = 0.029; neutrophil count: 8.504 +- 5.993 vs. 3.764 +- 2.733, P = 0.008; BUN: 8.300 +- 4.072 vs. 4.364 +- 1.196, P = 0.001; Figure 1).\nComparison of laboratory parameters between dementia and nondementia patients.\nIs there a correlation between the upregulation of inflammation indicators (WBC and neutrophil counts) and the impairment of renal function (BUN)? Our results suggest that WBC and neutrophil counts and BUN levels in nondementia patients were significantly positively correlated (WBC count: r2=0.376, P &lt; 0.05, Figure 2A; neutrophil count: r2=0.325, P &lt; 0.05, Figure 2B). However, we did not find such a significant correlation in patients with dementia (Figure 2C and 2D).\nCorrelation between inflammation and renal function. (A) Correlation analysis of BUN and neutrophil count in all patients with mental disorders; (B) correlation analysis of BUN and WBC count in all patients with mental disorders; (C) matched test of BUN and neutrophil count in dementia patients; (D) matched test of BUN and WBC count in dementia patients. ns: no significance.\nDISCUSSION\nIn this study, we collected data on baseline characteristics, clinical symptoms, laboratory parameters and mental disease types in patients with mental disorders with COVID-19. The above information was used to find internal associations or differences as much as possible. Differences between patients with moderate/mild symptoms and patients with severe symptoms were mainly reflected in blood oxygen saturation, anorexia/nausea, and dyspnea. We analyzed the prognosis of patients and found that the mortality rate of dementia patients was significantly higher than that of patients with other mental disorders. In addition, the WBC count, neutrophil count and BUN level of patients with dementia were significantly higher than those of patients with other mental disorders.\nFacing such a very interesting result, we needed to explore why the mortality rate of dementia patients was so high. First, dementia tends to have severe mental and behavioral symptoms. Second, due to less activity and long-term bed rest, the incidence of serious complications, such as pressure ulcers, lung infections, and cardiopulmonary insufficiency, is higher in dementia patients than in nondementia patients. Last but not least, inflammation might play an important role in the pathogenesis of dementia. Inflammation is a characteristic of Alzheimer's disease (AD; the most important cause of dementia). AD dementia patients also have different degrees of inflammation. Chronic inflammation is a common feature of various types of vascular dementia (the second most important cause of dementia). In addition to amyloid protein, inflammatory molecules, including acute inflammatory reactants and inflammatory cytokines, have been found in the cerebrospinal fluid of dementia patients. Peripheral infection will also aggravate the onset and development of AD. However, in another study of general patients with COVID-19, patients with severe cases tended to have higher leukocyte counts and neutrophil-lymphocyte ratios. Therefore, the persistent inflammatory state of dementia patients may be the cause of the increased peripheral blood WBC and neutrophil counts in dementia patients with COVID-19.\nAt present, there is not enough evidence to support that the renal function damage of dementia patients with COVID-19 is worse than that of patients with other mental disorders. In our study, the inflammatory response of patients with mental disorders was associated with renal impairment, but this phenomenon was not statistically significant in patients with dementia. Therefore, the increase in BUN levels may not be unique to patients with dementia with COVID-19. It may be that these patients have severe symptoms, which lead to damage to renal function. Of course, due to the limitation of the sample size of dementia patients, the trend of the correlation analysis may be masked. Therefore, the correlation between the inflammatory response and renal function impairment in dementia patients needs to be treated with caution. At least, based on the current results and previous evidence, it is not enough to deny this conclusion.\nIt is worth noting that the following limitations of this study cannot be ignored. Since our research is limited to patients with mental disorders, which makes the sample size insufficient, the probability of false-positive errors seen in small-sample clinical studies is difficult to avoid. In addition, dementia may also be accompanied by other mental disorders, and the heterogeneity between patients may result in an overestimation of the statistical results. Nonetheless, our research indicated that the mortality rate of dementia patients with COVID-19 was higher than that of patients with other mental disorders. A focus on the inflammatory response of dementia may provide novel ideas for reducing mortality.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nParticipants and materials\nAll patients who were diagnosed with mental disorders and with COVID-19 at the intensive care unit of Wuhan Mental Health Center during the period January 2 to March 1, 2020 were selected. The definition of the mental disorders was based on the International Classification of Diseases-10 (ICD-10). The diagnosis of COVID-19 was made according to the standards for the &quot;Diagnosis and Treatment Scheme of New Coronavirus Infected Pneumonia&quot; (trial version 6). Finally, a total of 30 newly diagnosed COVID-19 patients with mental disorders were considered candidates in our study. Exclusion criteria included other infectious diseases, hepatic or renal insufficiency, and malignancies. No patient received COVID-19-related antiviral or symptomatic treatment before entering this study.\nData collection\nWe reviewed electronic patient records retrospectively; clinical and laboratory parameters were extracted, including sex, age, the types of mental disorders, COVID-19 nucleic acid detection, routine blood test and laboratory biochemical examination results, such as total protein (TP), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), creatinine (Cr), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and uric acid (UA), and so on. These laboratory parameters were evaluated when patients first underwent laboratory tests in the hospital. The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Wuhan Mental Health Center, and all patients provided informed consent.\nStatistical analysis\nAll data were analyzed by using SPSS 16.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL) and GraphPad Prism 5. Continuous variables are shown as the mean +- the standard deviation (SD), and categorical variables are shown as percentages. Before analysis, the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test was conducted to identify variable normality. Continuous variables with normal distribution were analyzed by an independent-sample t test, and non-normally distributed data were compared by a rank-sum test. P &lt; 0.05 was considered statistically significant.\nEthical statement\nAll procedures performed in studies involving human participants were in accordance with the ethical standards of the institutional and/or national research committee and with the 1964 Declaration of Helsinki and its later amendments or comparable ethical standards. Informed consent was obtained from all individual participants included in the study.\nAUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONS: The work presented here was carried out in collaboration among all authors.

Of six family members who travelled to Wuhan, five were identified as infected with the novel coronavirus.\n\n Additionally, one family member, who did not travel to Wuhan, became infected with the virus after several days of contact with four of the family members.\n\n None of the family members had contacts with Wuhan markets or animals, although two had visited a Wuhan hospital.\n\n Five family members (aged 36–66 years) presented with fever, upper or lower respiratory tract symptoms, or diarrhoea, or a combination of these 3–6 days after exposure.\n\n They presented to our hospital (The University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen) 6–10 days after symptom onset.\n\n They and one asymptomatic child (aged 10 years) had radiological ground-glass lung opacities.\n\n Older patients (aged &gt;60 years) had more systemic symptoms, extensive radiological ground-glass lung changes, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and increased C-reactive protein and lactate dehydrogenase levels.\n\n The nasopharyngeal or throat swabs of these six patients were negative for known respiratory microbes by point-of-care multiplex RT-PCR, but five patients (four adults and the child) were RT-PCR positive for genes encoding the internal RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and surface Spike protein of this novel coronavirus, which were confirmed by Sanger sequencing.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis

characteristics of COVID-19-infected cancer patients: a retrospective case study in three hospitals within Wuhan, China","abstract":"Background\nCancer patients are regarded as a highly vulnerable group in the current Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic.\n\n To date, the clinical characteristics of COVID-19-infected cancer patients remain largely unknown.\n\n\nPatients and methods\nIn this retrospective cohort study, we included cancer patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 from three designated hospitals in Wuhan, China.\n\n Clinical data were collected from medical records from 13 January 2020 to 26 February 2020. Univariate and multivariate analyses were carried out to assess the risk factors associated with severe events defined as a condition requiring admission to an intensive care unit, the use of mechanical ventilation, or death.\n\n\nResults\nA total of 28 COVID-19-infected cancer patients were included; 17 (60.7%) patients were male.\n\n Median (interquartile range) age was 65.0 (56.0–70.0) years.\n\n Lung cancer was the most frequent cancer type (n = 7; 25.0%).\n\n Eight (28.6%) patients were suspected to have hospital-associated transmission.\n\n The following clinical features were shown in our cohort: fever (n = 23, 82.1%), dry cough (n = 22, 81%), and dyspnoea (n = 14, 50.0%), along with lymphopaenia (n = 23, 82.1%), high level of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (n = 23, 82.1%), anaemia (n = 21, 75.0%), and hypoproteinaemia (n = 25, 89.3%).\n\n The common chest computed tomography (CT) findings were ground-glass opacity (n = 21, 75.0%) and patchy consolidation (n = 13, 46.3%).\n\n A total of 15 (53.6%) patients had severe events and the mortality rate was 28.6%.\n\n If the last antitumour treatment was within 14 days, it significantly increased the risk of developing severe events [hazard ratio (HR) = 4.079, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.086–15.322, P = 0.037].\n\n Furthermore, patchy consolidation on CT on admission was associated with a higher risk of developing severe events (HR = 5.438, 95% CI 1.498–19.748, P = 0.010).\n\n\nConclusions\nCancer patients show deteriorating conditions and poor outcomes from the COVID-19 infection.\n\n It is recommended that cancer patients receiving antitumour treatments should have vigorous screening for COVID-19 infection and should avoid treatments causing immunosuppression or have their dosages decreased in case of COVID-19 coinfection.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7270947","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"European Society for Medical Oncology.

novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).\n\n We report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatment and clinical outcomes of these patients.\n\n\nMethods\nAll patients with suspected 2019-nCoV were admitted to a designated hospital in Wuhan.\n\n We prospectively collected and analysed data on patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection by real-time RT-PCR and next-generation sequencing.\n\n Data were obtained with standardised data collection forms shared by WHO and the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium from electronic medical records.\n\n Researchers also directly communicated with patients or their families to ascertain epidemiological and symptom data.\n\n Outcomes were also compared between patients who had been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and those who had not.\n\n\nFindings\nBy Jan 2, 2020, 41 admitted hospital patients had been identified as having laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection.\n\n Most of the infected patients were men (30 [73%] of 41); less than half had underlying diseases (13 [32%]), including diabetes (eight [20%]), hypertension (six [15%]), and cardiovascular disease (six [15%]).\n\n Median age was 49·0 years (IQR 41·0–58·0).\n\n 27 (66%) of 41 patients had been exposed to Huanan seafood market.\n\n One family cluster was found.\n\n Common symptoms at onset of illness were fever (40 [98%] of 41 patients), cough (31 [76%]), and myalgia or fatigue (18 [44%]); less common symptoms were sputum production (11 [28%] of 39), headache (three [8%] of 38), haemoptysis (two [5%] of 39), and diarrhoea (one [3%] of 38).\n\n Dyspnoea developed in 22 (55%) of 40 patients (median time from illness onset to dyspnoea 8·0 days [IQR 5·0–13·0]).\n\n 26 (63%) of 41 patients had lymphopenia.\n\n All 41 patients had pneumonia with abnormal findings on chest CT.\n\n Complications included acute respiratory distress syndrome (12 [29%]), RNAaemia (six [15%]), acute cardiac injury (five [12%]) and secondary infection (four [10%]).\n\n 13 (32%) patients were admitted to an ICU and six (15%) died.\n\n Compared with non-ICU patients, ICU patients had higher plasma levels of IL2, IL7, IL10, GSCF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNF?.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe 2019-nCoV infection caused clusters of severe respiratory illness similar

glucocorticoid receptor-activator protein 1 interaction in steroid-resistant asthma","abstract":"Glucocorticosteroids are a very effective treatment for asthma and other chronic inflammatory diseases.\n However, a small proportion of patients is resistant to the therapeutic effects of glucocorticoids.\n Pharmacokinetic and ligand binding studies suggest that the molecular abnormality in steroid resistance lies distal to nuclear translocation.\n We have previously reported that there is a decreased ability of glucocorticoid receptors (GR) to bind to the DNA-binding site in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) after dexamethasone treatment.\n This reduced DNA binding was due to a decrease in the number of receptors available rather than an alteration in affinity for DNA.\n To study this reduced DNA binding, we examined the ability of the nuclear translocated transcription factors activator protein 1 (AP-1), nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappa B) and cyclic AMP response element- binding protein (CREB) to bind to their DNA-binding sites and to interact with GR in PBMC from patients with steroid-sensitive and steroid-resistant asthma.\n There was a significant reduction in the interaction between GR and AP-1 in these steroid-resistant patients, although interaction with other transcription factors activated in inflammation (NF-kappa B and CREB) was unaffected.\n An increase in the basal levels of AP-1 DNA binding was also detected in the nuclei from steroid-resistant asthmatic patients.\n There were no differences in the amount of messenger RNA detected for the components of AP-1, c-Fos and c-Jun, nor in the sequences of these messenger RNAs.\n These results suggest either that the ability of the GR to bind to glucocorticoid response elements and AP-1 is altered in steroid-resistant patients or that increased levels of AP-1 prevent GR DNA binding, and that this may be the molecular basis of resistance to the antiinflammatory effect of steroids in these cells.\n","id":"PMC2192226","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"The Rockefeller University

Mortality was not associated with long-term care residence, dementia, delirium, or polypharmacy. In multivariable logistic regression analyses, CFS, LDH, and RT-PCR Ct (but not age) remained independently associated with mortality. Both age and frailty had poor specificity to predict survival. A multivariable model combining age, CFS, LDH, and viral load significantly predicted survival.\nConclusions and Implications\nAlthough their prognosis is worse, even the oldest and most severely frail patients may benefit from hospitalization for COVID-19, if sufficient resources are available.\nCoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a global pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Older adults are at increased risk of hospitalization and mortality due to COVID-19. \nDifferent ethical guidelines deal with triage in case a surge in hospital admissions due to COVID-19 overwhelms scarce hospital resources. Likelihood of benefit, age, and frailty are among the most commonly used triage criteria.   In the United Kingdom and in Belgium (among other countries), intensive care unit (ICU) admission is not recommended for frail older adults aged 65 years and older.   These guidelines rely on frailty assessment according to the Rockwood Clinical Frailty Scale (CFS). Patients can be classified on the CFS as not frail (scores 1-4), mildly frail (score 5), moderately frail (score 6), or severely frail (score 7-9). ICU admission is discouraged for frail older adults, that is, those with a CFS score of 5 or higher, in the United Kingdom and Belgium.   Hospital admission is discouraged for nursing home residents with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 and a CFS score of 7 or higher. \nPrevious studies have shown that frailty is associated with worse outcomes in hospitalized older adults.   However, little is known about the outcomes in frail older adults or long-term care residents hospitalized for COVID-19. Therefore, the aim of this retrospective observational study was to describe outcomes in hospitalized geriatric COVID-19 patients according to their age, degree of frailty, and place of residence.\nMethods\nStudy Design\nA retrospective, single-center observational study was performed among COVID-19 patients at the geriatrics department of our General Hospital in Belgium, admitted between March 12 and April 30, 2020. Demographic, clinical, laboratory, and radiographic parameters were extracted from electronic health records. Laboratory values included C-reactive protein (CRP; reference values &lt;5 mg/L); ferritin; d-dimers; lactate dehydrogenase (LDH); 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels; and white blood cell, platelet, and lymphocyte counts. Polypharmacy was defined as the use of 5 or more medications.\nEthics\nThe Ethical Committee approved the research protocol and waived the need for informed consent, because it did not constitute a clinical study according to national and European regulations.\nClinical Procedures\nCOVID-19 was confirmed by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing on nasopharyngeal swabs, using protocols validated within our national SARS-CoV-2 reference network. All patients admitted through the emergency department were screened for COVID-19 by low-dose chest computed tomography (CT). Findings on COVID-19 likelihood and extent of pulmonary involvement (CT score ranging 0-25) were reported using a standardized radiologic protocol as described previously. \nAll COVID-19 patients in our hospital were hospitalized on dedicated wards under the care of a staff pulmonologist, nephrologist, infectious disease specialist or geriatrician, depending on their usual care team (eg, nephrology in dialysis patients). Additional local criteria to admit patients under geriatric care were age 85 years or older, long-term care residence or equivalent home care (ie, complete dependency on assistance for activities of daily living), patients with dementia or delirium, or patients aged 75 years and older with multiple comorbidities and polypharmacy.\nOn admission, an experienced geriatrician scored premorbid frailty according to the CFS based on information from patients, their families, and caregivers, primary care referral letters, or long-term care records.\nStatistics\nResults for continuous and categorical variables are reported as median and interquartile range and number (percentage), respectively. Differences between survivors and nonsurvivors were examined using Mann-Whitney U test and chi-square test for continuous and categorical variables, respectively. Association of age, frailty, and other baseline characteristics with mortality were evaluated by Spearman r and multiple logistic regression. Survival according to frailty status was examined using odds ratios, survival analyses (log-rank Mantel-Cox test) and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. Two-tailed P values &lt;.05 were considered significant. All analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism v8.4.2.\nResults\nCharacteristics of the Population According to Survival Status\n	All (N = 81)	Survivors (n = 62)	Nonsurvivors (n = 19)	P	Spearman r	 	Sex				.89		 	 Men	33 (41)	25 (40)	8			 	 Women	48 (59)	37 (60)	11			 	Age	85 (81-90)	84.5 (79-89)	88 (84-90)	.03	0.241	 	LTC resident				.27		 	 Yes	42 (52)	30 (48)	12			 	 No	39 (48)	32 (52)	7			 	CFS score	7 (5-7)	6 (4-7)	7 (6-8)	.011	0.282	 	Dementia				.77		 	 Yes	36 (44)	26 (43)	10			 	 No	45 (56)	36 (57)	9			 	Polypharmacy				.52		 	 Yes	52 (64)	41 (65)	11			 	 No	29 (36)	21 (35)	8			 	CT score	9 (5-12)	9 (5-12)	9.5 (5-16.5)	.39		 	RT-PCR Ct value	24.65 (20.25-28.78)	25.95 (21.50-29.38)	21.65 (19.28-22.95)	.015	-0.285	 	CRP, mg/L	58 (32-89)	56 (32-88)	75 (39-130)	.20		 	CRPmax, mg/L	110 (59-155)	88 (47-140)	190 (110-270)	&lt;.001	0.453	 	LDH, U/L	305 (235-396)	286 (229-367)	390 (315-493)	.009	0.301	 	Lymphocytes, 103/muL	0.9 (0.6-1.2)	0.9 (0.7-1.25)	0.55 (0.4-1.05)	.020	-0.262	 	Lymphocyte nadir, 103/muL	0.7 (0.5-0.95)	0.8 (0.6-1.1)	0.4 (0.275-0.65)	&lt;.001	-0.419	 	Delirium				.88		 	 Yes	34 (42)	26 (42)	8			 	 No	47 (58)	36 (58)	11			 	Length of stay, d	13 (8-18.5)	13 (8-21)	7 (3.75-15)	.050		 	\nLTC, long-term care.\nValues are median (interquartile range) or n (%).\nBaseline characteristics of our cohort are shown in Table 1 . Median age was 85 years (minimum 65, maximum 97 years), and 48 were women (59%). Median CFS score was 7 (range 2-9). Dementia had been diagnosed in 36 patients (44%), and 42 (52%) were long-term care residents. Polypharmacy was present in 52 (64%) subjects.\nSex, place of residence, dementia, polypharmacy, extent of affected lung tissue on CT, or CRP values at baseline did not differ between survivors and nonsurvivors. However, compared to survivors of COVID-19, nonsurvivors were significantly older (88.5 vs 85 years, median age) and frailer (median CFS 7 vs 6). Their RT-PCR cycling threshold (Ct) values were also significantly lower (indicating higher viral load). Baseline LDH was significantly higher and baseline lymphocyte count lower in nonsurvivors. Baseline CRP, ferritin, d-dimer, white blood cell, platelet, or 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels were not different (latter data not shown). Lymphopenia was present on admission in 48 patients (60%) and occurred during admission in 60 of 80 patients (75%; 1 patient was excluded because of chronic lymphocytic leukemia). The peak CRP and lymphocyte nadir reached during admission was higher among nonsurvivors, and these differences were highly significant. Length of stay tended to be shorter in those who died (P = .05).\nAmong these variables, the CFS score was associated with dementia (P &lt; .0001, r = 0.602), long-term care residence (P &lt; .0001, r = 0.465), and weakly with sex (lower frailty in males, P = .007, r = -0.296) and incident delirium (P = .043, r = 0.230). There was no significant association between CFS and older age in our cohort.\nOne of 17 patients died in the nonfrail group (CFS score 1-4), compared with 18 deaths among 64 frail patients; however, this difference did not reach significance (P = .054). Supplementary Figure 1A shows survivors and nonsurvivors according to their age and CFS. Most deaths occurred in older, frailer patients. However, this group overlapped considerably with many surviving frail older patients. Kaplan-Meier curves also showed only a trend towards higher mortality in frail vs nonfrail subjects (Mantel-Cox log-rank P = .06, Supplementary Figure 1B).\nOdds Ratios of 4 Independent Variables That Predict Mortality (Outcome Variable) in a Univariate and 2 Multivariate Models (Logistic Regression Analyses)\n	Single-Factor Model	Model Age + CFS	Four-Factor Model	 	Age				 	 OR	1.117 (1.021-1.240)*	1.096 (1.002-1.218)	1.134 (1.002-1.333)	 	 AUROC	0.664 (0.531-0.797)*			 	CFS score				 	 OR	1.705 (1.173-2.750)*	1.588 (1.105-2.524)*	1.752 (1.096-3.435)*	 	 AUROC	0.688 (0.555-0.821)*			 	RT-PCR Ct value				 	 OR	0.897 (0.798-0.994)*		0.850 (0.723-0.972)*	 	 AUROC	0.698 (0.559-0.836)*			 	LDH (U/L)				 	 OR	1.005 (1.001-1.010)*		1.005 (1.000-1.011)*	 	 AUROC	0.7124 (0.571-0.853)*			 	\nOR, odds ratio; AUROC, area under the receiver operating characteristic curve.\nValues are listed with 95% confidence intervals between brackets.\nP &lt; .05.\n(A) Receiver operating characteristic curves for model with age + clinical frailty score (CFS). (B) Receiver operating characteristic curve for model including age, CFS, reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction cycling threshold (RT-PCR Ct values), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels.\nNext, we examined the clinical diagnostic utility of the individual variables that were significantly associated with mortality, in multiple logistic regression analyses. Again, age, CFS, RT-PCR Ct values, and LDH were significantly associated with higher odds of mortality (Table 2 and Supplementary Figure 1 C-F), whereas baseline lymphocyte count was no longer significant. In a bivariate model with age and CFS score combined, only the CFS remained significantly associated with mortality. The area under the ROC curve (AUROC) was 0.7443 (95% confidence interval 0.6213-0.8673) for this model (Figure 1 A), with a positive and negative predictive value of 57% and 80%, respectively. When age and CFS were combined with RT-PCR Ct values and LDH, the latter 3 variables remained significantly associated with mortality. The 4-factor model predicted the probability of mortality (range 0-1) as follows (intercept + beta1*age + beta2*CFS + beta3*RT-PCR Ct value + beta4*LDH): -13.89 + 0.126*years + 0.561*CFS-score + (-0.1623)*Ct + 0.5275*[U/L]/100 (Supplementary Table 1). The AUROC for this model was 0.8824 (0.7384-1.000, P &lt; .0001, Figure 1B), with a negative predictive power of 89.5% and a positive predictive power of 78%, sensitivity of 54% and specificity of 78%.\nSeven patients were treated with hydroxychloroquine, 60 (74%) with antibiotics, 46 (57%) with intravenous fluid support, and 25 with glucocorticoids (31%). Seven patients were admitted to the ICU, 5 of whom died. The odds ratio for mortality was significantly higher in patients requiring ICU admission (P = .0017).\nThere were 13 cases of presumably hospital-acquired COVID-19 (taking into account negative RT-PCR on admission, incubation time, and a local outbreak in 1 of our non-COVID-19 wards). Four of these patients died. There was no significantly higher or lower mortality between presumed hospital-acquired or community-acquired COVID-19 cases.\nDiscussion\nThe current COVID-19 pandemic particularly strikes frail older adults and/or long-term care residents, posing considerable medical and ethical challenges for our overwhelmed health care systems. Different guidelines have been released to assist in the triage in this population.     Belgian and UK guidelines recommend the CFS to inform decision making regarding hospital referral of nursing home residents with suspected or confirmed COVID-19. However, empirical evidence supporting the use of frailty instruments to predict treatment outcomes and thus apply triage restrictions has remained lacking. \nThe short-term mortality (~23%) in this case series is similar to mortality rates reported for hospitalized older adults in Wuhan or California,   but lower than that reported by Sun et al or than in the New York City area. This may be considered unexpected, given the greater frailty and older age of our patients compared with previous cohorts. Similar or higher mortality rates have been reported in long-term care residents or in younger ICU populations. These findings support the notion that it may be discriminatory and unethical to restrict hospital care based on age or frailty status alone.   Still, mortality was higher in patients requiring ICU transfer in our cohort, suggesting that intensive care is of unclear clinical benefit in this population. \nOlder age was significantly but weakly associated with increased risk of mortality, confirming recent studies. Anecdotally, nonagenarians or centenarians have survived COVID-19. Our main finding was that frailty was also significantly but weakly associated with a higher risk of mortality in COVID-19 patients (multivariate odds ratio for mortality with each higher CFS point: 1.75.) Still, many severely frail patients survived (72%), and the CFS by itself had poor specificity and no useful cut-off for mortality prediction. A recent study from Italy showed that in a sample of 105 COVID-19 patients, frailty as assessed by the Frailty Index was associated with in-hospital mortality or ICU admission, independent of age and sex. \nApart from age and frailty, LDH was the only circulating biomarker significantly associated with mortality in our cohort. This confirms prior studies. However, only a few patients met this criterion in our cohort, making it practically useless. Maximal CRP and nadir lymphocyte count during admission was significantly associated with mortality, but these parameters are not available at baseline. Interestingly, we observed a significant association between RT-PCR Ct values and mortality. Viral load peaks longer in patients with more severe COVID-19 and in older adults, as shown by Zheng et al. We speculate that a higher viral load may also be a marker for increased risk of mortality, although sampling bias needs to be excluded before we can support this conclusion. Of note, our RT-PCR method was semi-quantitative rather than quantitative, precluding extrapolation to other settings. The 4-factor model combining clinical, host, and viral parameters showed the most promising characteristics but still remained inadequate from a clinical perspective. Sun et al reported a similar logistic regression model based on older age and lymphocyte count. Further work is needed to establish optimal clinical, viral, and host immune system characteristics to predict mortality among COVID-19 patients. \nOur study provides the geriatric community with several novel insights into the outcomes of frail older COVID-19 patients. However, we recognize several limitations, mainly due to our retrospective study design. Because data were obtained retrospectively from electronic health records, missing data (eg, for CT scan or biochemical parameters) may have introduced bias, and follow-up was limited. However, selection bias is unlikely, because we had included consecutive cases in a country with universal health coverage. Caution should be applied to extrapolate findings from this single-center study to other health care settings. The associations we observed may not be causally related. Despite our robust findings on the association between frailty and mortality, some analyses were likely underpowered. A larger sample size would have helped reduce the size of our parameter estimate confidence intervals and increase the validity of our model; however, the first COVID-19 wave ended in our hospital and no more deaths have accumulated. We chose not to include patients with so-called radiographically confirmed COVID-19, that is, with typical clinical features and radiographic evidence on chest CT but with repeatedly negative SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR. However, only 3 such patients were excluded, which is unlikely to have influenced the results.\nMany instruments to determine frailty are available. We applied the CFS, which has been adopted in several national COVID-19 triage policies, most notably by UK NICE guidelines. Previous research has shown that CFS scores can reliably be obtained in critically ill patients based on chart review and patient and/or family interview. However, we recommend further research to ascertain the reproducibility and reliability before widespread implementation of the CFS during COVID-19 outbreaks. Importantly, we were unable to include younger, nonfrail patients, because frailty was not assessed in nongeriatric patients. The association between frailty and mortality would likely have been stronger if we included younger, less frail patients.\nConclusions and Implications\nIn summary, we showed that age and frailty were significantly but weakly associated with mortality among hospitalized older adults affected by COVID-19. However, both frailty and age alone have poor specificity to predict mortality, and many severely frail patients survived COVID-19. We recommend clinicians, ethicists, and policy makers to consider these empirical findings.\nReferences\nCOVID-19 and older adults: What we know\nPresenting characteristics, comorbidities, and outcomes among 5700 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 in the New York City area\nCharacteristics of hospitalized adults with COVID-19 in an integrated health care system in California\nClinical course and risk factors for mortality of adult inpatients with COVID-19 in Wuhan, China: A retrospective cohort study\nCoronavirus disease 2019 in geriatrics and long-term care: The ABCDs of COVID-19\nAGS position statement: Resource allocation strategies and age-related considerations in the COVID-19 era and beyond\nRationing limited health care resources in the COVID-19 era and beyond: Ethical considerations regarding older adults\nCOVID-19 in Italy: Ageism and decision making in a pandemic\nVentilator triage policies during the COVID-19 pandemic at U.S. Hospitals Associated With Members of the Association of Bioethics Program Directors\nUniversal do-not-resuscitate orders, social worth, and life-years: Opposing discriminatory approaches to the allocation of resources during the COVID-19 pandemic and other health system catastrophes\nNICE guideline [NG159]: COVID-19 rapid guideline: Critical care in adults\nComplementing chronic frailty assessment at hospital admission with an electronic frailty index (FI-Laboratory) comprising routine blood test results\nThe impact of frailty on intensive care unit outcomes: A systematic review and meta-analysis\nAccuracy and reproducibility of low-dose submillisievert chest CT for the diagnosis of COVID-19\nCOVID-19: Use of the clinical frailty scale for critical care decisions\nFrailty in the face of COVID-19\nRisk factors for mortality in 244 older adults with COVID-19 in Wuhan, China: A retrospective study\nEpidemiology of COVID-19 in a long-term care facility in king county, Washington\nBaseline characteristics and outcomes of 1591 patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 admitted to ICUs of the Lombardy Region, Italy\nA framework for rationing ventilators and critical care beds during the COVID-19 pandemic\nIsrael ad hoc COVID 19 committee.

coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) started in December, 2019, in Wuhan, China.\n\n Information about critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection is scarce.\n\n We aimed to describe the clinical course and outcomes of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this single-centered, retrospective, observational study, we enrolled 52 critically ill adult patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia who were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) of Wuhan Jin Yin-tan hospital (Wuhan, China) between late December, 2019, and Jan 26, 2020. Demographic data, symptoms, laboratory values, comorbidities, treatments, and clinical outcomes were all collected.\n\n Data were compared between survivors and non-survivors.\n\n The primary outcome was 28-day mortality, as of Feb 9, 2020. Secondary outcomes included incidence of SARS-CoV-2-related acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and the proportion of patients requiring mechanical ventilation.\n\n\nFindings\nOf 710 patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, 52 critically ill adult patients were included.\n\n The mean age of the 52 patients was 59·7 (SD 13·3) years, 35 (67%) were men, 21 (40%) had chronic illness, 51 (98%) had

length in a German cohort","abstract":"Background\nThe epigenetic clock, in particular epigenetic pre-aging quantified by the so-called DNA methylation age acceleration, has recently been suggested to closely correlate with a variety of disease phenotypes.\n\n There remains a dearth of data, however, on its association with telomere length and frailty, which can be considered major correlates of age on the genomic and clinical level, respectively.\n\n\nResults\nIn this cross-sectional observational study on altogether 1820 subjects from two subsets (n?=?969 and n?=?851; mean?±?standard deviation age 62.1?±?6.5 and 63.0?±?6.7 years, respectively) of the ESTHER cohort study of the elderly general population in Germany, DNA methylation age was calculated based on a 353 loci predictor previously developed in a large meta-study, and the difference-based epigenetic age acceleration was calculated as predicted methylation age minus chronological age.\n\n No correlation of epigenetic age acceleration with telomere length was found in our study (p?=?0.63).\n\n However, there was an association of DNA methylation age acceleration with a comprehensive frailty measure, such that the accumulated deficits significantly increased with increasing age acceleration.\n\n Quantitatively, about half an additional deficit was added per 6 years of methylation age acceleration (p?=?0.0004).\n\n This association was independent from age, sex, and estimated leukocyte distribution, as well as from a variety of other confounding variables considered.\n\n\nConclusions\nThe results of the present study suggest that epigenetic age acceleration is correlated with clinically relevant aging-related phenotypes through pathways unrelated to cellular senescence as assessed by telomere length.\n\n Innovative approaches like Mendelian randomization will be needed to elucidate whether epigenetic age acceleration indeed plays a causal role for the development of clinical phenotypes.\n\n\nElectronic supplementary material\nThe online version of this article (doi:10.1186/s13148-016-0186-5) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized

systems leading to declines in homeostatic reserve and resiliency, but unresolved issues persist about its detection, underlying pathophysiology, and relationship with aging, disability, and multimorbidity.\n A particularly challenging area is the relationship between frailty and hospitalization.\n Based on the deliberations of a 2014 Canadian expert consultation meeting and a scoping review of the relevant literature between 2005 and 2015, this discussion paper presents a review of the current state of knowledge on frailty in the acute care setting, including its prevalence and ability to both predict the occurrence and outcomes of hospitalization.\n The examination of the available evidence highlighted a number of specific clinical and research topics requiring additional study.\n We conclude with a series of consensus recommendations regarding future research priorities in this important

frailty has been defined as a multidimensional syndrome characterized by the loss of physical and cognitive reserve that predisposes to the accumulation of deficits and increased vulnerability to adverse events.\n Frailty is strongly correlated with age, and overlaps with and extends aspects of a patient's disability status (that is, functional limitation) and/or burden of comorbid disease.\n The frail phenotype has more specifically been characterized by adverse changes to a patient's mobility, muscle mass, nutritional status, strength and endurance.\n We contend that, in selected circumstances, the critically ill patient may be analogous to the frail geriatric patient.\n The prevalence of frailty amongst critically ill patients is currently unknown; however, it is probably increasing, based on data showing that the utilization of intensive care unit (ICU) resources by older people is rising.\n Owing to the theoretical similarities in frailty between geriatric and critically ill patients, this concept may have clinical relevance and may be predictive of outcomes, along with showing important interaction with several factors including illness severity, comorbid disease, and the social and structural environment.\n We believe studies of frailty in critically ill patients are needed to evaluate how it correlates with outcomes such as survival and quality of life, and how it relates to resource utilization, such as length of mechanical ventilation, ICU stay and duration of hospitalization.\n We hypothesize that the objective measurement of frailty may provide additional support and reinforcement to clinicians confronted with end-of-life decisions on the appropriateness of ICU support and/or withholding of life-sustaining therapies.\n","id":"PMC3222010","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"BioMed Central","authors":[{"firstname":"Robert

during the past decade, as has the intensity of care for such patients.\n Yet, many physicians remain reluctant to admit the oldest, arguing a 'squandering' of societal resources, that ICU care could be deleterious, or that ICU care may not actually be what the patient or family wants in this instance.\n Other ICU physicians are strong advocates for admission of a selected elderly population.\n These discrepant opinions may partly be explained by the current lack of validated criteria to select accurately the patients (of any age) who will benefit most from ICU hospitalization.\n This review describes the epidemiology of the elderly aged 80 years and older admitted in the ICU, their long-term outcomes, and to discuss some of the solutions to cope with the burden of an aging population

prognosis.\n\n We examined the relationship between the frailty index (FI) based on deficit accumulation and early and late survival.\n\n\nMethods.\n\nOlder patients (?65 years) admitted to a specialized geriatric ICU at the Liuhuaqiao Hospital, Guangzhou, China between July–December 2011 (n = 155; age 82.7±7.1 y; 87.1% men) were followed for 300 days.\n\n The FI was calculated as the proportion present of 52 health deficits.\n\n FI performance was compared with that of several prognostic scores.\n\n\nResults.\n\nThe 90-day death rate was 38.7% (n = 60; 27 died within 30 days).\n\n The FI score was correlated with the Glasgow Coma Scale, Karnofsky Scale, Palliative Performance Scale, Acute Physiology Score—APACHE II and APACHE IV (r\n2 = 0.52 to 0.72, p &lt; 0.001).\n\n Patients who died within 30 days had higher mean FI scores (0.41±0.11) than those who survived to 300 days (0.22±0.11; F = 38.91, p &lt; 0.001).\n\n Each 1% increase in the FI from the previous level was associated with an 11% increase in the 30-day mortality risk (95% CI: 7%–15%) adjusting for age, sex, and the prognostic scores.\n\n The FI discriminated patients who died in 30 days from those who survived with moderately high accuracy (AUC = 0.89±0.03).\n\n No one with an FI score &gt;0.46 survived past 90 days.\n\n\nConclusion.\n\nICU survival was strongly associated with the level of frailty

paper develops a method for appraising health status in elderly people.\n A frailty index was defined as the proportion of accumulated deficits (symptoms, signs, functional impairments, and laboratory abnormalities).\n It serves as an individual state variable, reflecting severity of illness and proximity to death.\n In a representative database of elderly Canadians we found that deficits accumulated at 3% per year, and show a gamma distribution, typical for systems with redundant components that can be used in case of failure of a given subsystem.\n Of note, the slope of the index is insensitive to the individual nature of the deficits, and serves as an important prognostic factor for life expectancy.\n The formula for estimating an individual's life span given the frailty index value is presented.\n For different patterns of cognitive impairments the average within-group index value increases with the severity of the cognitive impairment, and the relative variability of the index is significantly reduced.\n Finally, the statistical distribution of the frailty index sharply differs between well groups (gamma distribution) and morbid groups (normal distribution).\n This pattern reflects an increase in uncompensated deficits in impaired organisms, which would lead to illness of various etiologies, and ultimately to increased mortality.\n The accumulation of deficits is as an example of a macroscopic variable, i.\ne.\n, one that reflects general properties of aging at the level of the whole organism rather than any given functional deficiency.\n In consequence, we propose that it may be used as a proxy measure of aging.\n","id":"PMC6084020","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"TheScientificWorldJOURNAL","authors":[{"firstname":"Arnold

a priority.\n\n Geriatric research has proposed several indicators shown to be associated with these outcomes, but a head-to-head comparison of their predictive accuracy is still lacking.\n\n We therefore aimed to compare the accuracy of five geriatric health indicators in predicting different outcomes among older persons: frailty index (FI), frailty phenotype (FP), walking speed (WS), multimorbidity, and a summary score including clinical diagnoses, functioning, and disability (the Health Assessment Tool; HAT).\n\n\nMethods\nid='Par2'>Data were retrieved from the Swedish National Study on Aging and Care in Kungsholmen, an ongoing longitudinal study including 3363 people aged 60+.\n\n To inspect the accuracy of geriatric health indicators, we employed areas under the receiver

Hubei Province, China, in December 2019 and January 2020. We analyzed data on the first 425 confirmed cases in Wuhan to determine the epidemiologic characteristics of NCIP.\n\n\nMethods\nWe collected information on demographic characteristics, exposure history, and illness timelines of laboratory-confirmed cases of NCIP that had been reported by January 22, 2020. We described characteristics of the cases and estimated the key epidemiologic time-delay distributions.\n\n In the early period of exponential growth, we estimated the epidemic doubling time and the basic reproductive number.\n\n\nResults\nAmong the first 425 patients with confirmed NCIP, the median age was 59 years and 56% were male.\n\n The majority of cases (55%) with onset before January 1, 2020, were linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, as compared with 8.6% of the subsequent cases.\n\n The mean incubation period was 5.2 days (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.1 to 7.0), with the 95th percentile of the distribution at 12.5 days.\n\n In its early stages, the epidemic doubled in size every 7.4 days.\n\n With a mean serial interval of 7.5 days (95% CI, 5.3 to 19), the basic reproductive number was estimated to be 2.2 (95% CI, 1.4 to 3.9).\n\n\nConclusions\nOn the basis of this information, there is evidence that human-to-human transmission has occurred among close contacts since the middle of December 2019. Considerable efforts to reduce transmission will be required to control outbreaks if similar dynamics apply elsewhere.\n\n Measures to prevent or reduce transmission should be implemented in populations at risk.\n\n (Funded by the Ministry of Science and Technology of China and others.\n\n)\n","id":"PMC7121484","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Massachusetts Medical Society","authors":[{"firstname":"Qun","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xuhua","surname":"Guan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Peng","surname":"Wu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xiaoye","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lei","surname":"Zhou","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yeqing","surname":"Tong","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ruiqi","surname":"Ren","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Kathy S.M.","surname":"Leung","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Eric H.Y.","surname":"Lau","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jessica Y.","surname":"Wong","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xuesen","surname":"Xing","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Nijuan","surname":"Xiang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yang","surname":"Wu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Chao","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Qi","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Dan","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Tian","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jing","surname":"Zhao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Man","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Wenxiao","surname":"Tu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Chuding","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lianmei","surname":"Jin","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Rui","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Qi","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Suhua","surname":"Zhou","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Rui","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Hui","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yinbo","surname":"Luo","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yuan","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ge","surname":"Shao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Huan","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhongfa","surname":"Tao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yang","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhiqiang","surname":"Deng","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Boxi","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhitao","surname":"Ma","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yanping","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Guoqing","surname":"Shi","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Tommy T.Y.","surname":"Lam","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Joseph T.","surname":"Wu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"George F.","surname":"Gao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Benjamin J.","surname":"Cowling","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Bo","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Bo","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Gabriel M.","surname":"Leung","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zijian","surname":"Feng","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"World health organization.

We report detailed clinical and virological data for two related cases of MERS-CoV disease, after nosocomial transmission of the virus from one patient to another in a French hospital.\n\n\nMethods\nPatient 1 visited Dubai in April, 2013; patient 2 lives in France and did not travel abroad.\n\n Both patients had underlying immunosuppressive disorders.\n\n We tested specimens from the upper (nasopharyngeal swabs) or the lower (bronchoalveolar lavage, sputum) respiratory tract and whole blood, plasma, and serum specimens for MERS-CoV by real-time RT-PCR targeting the upE and Orf1A genes of MERS-CoV.\n\n\nFindings\nInitial clinical presentation included fever, chills, and myalgia in both patients, and for patient 1, diarrhoea.\n\n Respiratory symptoms rapidly became predominant with acute respiratory failure leading to mechanical ventilation and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO).\n\n Both patients developed acute renal failure.\n\n MERS-CoV was detected in lower respiratory tract specimens with high viral load (eg, cycle threshold [Ct] values of 22·9 for upE and 24 for Orf1a for a bronchoalveolar lavage sample from patient 1; Ct values of 22·5 for upE and 23·9 for Orf1a for an induced sputum sample from patient 2), whereas nasopharyngeal specimens were weakly positive or inconclusive.\n\n The two patients shared the same room for 3 days.\n\n The incubation period was estimated at 9–12 days for the second case.\n\n No secondary transmission was documented in hospital staff despite the absence of specific protective measures before the diagnosis of MERS-CoV was suspected.\n\n Patient 1 died on May 28, due to refractory multiple organ failure.\n\n\nInterpretation\nPatients with respiratory symptoms returning from the Middle East or exposed to a confirmed case should be isolated and investigated for MERS-CoV with lower respiratory tract sample analysis and an assumed incubation period of 12 days.\n\n Immunosuppression should also be taken into account as a risk factor.\n\n\nFunding\nFrench Institute for Public Health Surveillance, ANR grant Labex Integrative Biology of Emerging Infectious

open-label trial involving hospitalized adult patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, which causes the respiratory illness Covid-19, and an oxygen saturation (Sao2) of 94% or less while they were breathing ambient air or a ratio of the partial pressure of oxygen (Pao2) to the fraction of inspired oxygen (Fio2) of less than 300 mm Hg.\n\n Patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either lopinavir–ritonavir (400 mg and 100 mg, respectively) twice a day for 14 days, in addition to standard care, or standard care alone.\n\n The primary end point was the time to clinical improvement, defined as the time from randomization to either an improvement of two points on a seven-category ordinal scale or discharge from the hospital, whichever came first.\n\n\nResults\nA total of 199 patients with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection underwent randomization; 99 were assigned to the lopinavir–ritonavir group, and 100 to the standard-care group.\n\n Treatment with lopinavir–ritonavir was not associated with a difference from standard care in the time to clinical improvement (hazard ratio for clinical improvement, 1.24; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.90 to 1.72).\n\n Mortality at 28 days was similar in the lopinavir–ritonavir group and the standard-care group (19.2% vs.\n\n 25.0%; difference, ?5.8 percentage points; 95% CI, ?17.3 to 5.7).\n\n The percentages of patients with detectable viral RNA at various time points were similar.\n\n In a modified intention-to-treat analysis, lopinavir–ritonavir led to a median time to clinical improvement that was shorter by 1 day than that observed with standard care (hazard ratio, 1.39; 95% CI, 1.00 to 1.91).\n\n Gastrointestinal adverse events were more common in the lopinavir–ritonavir group, but serious adverse events were more common in the standard-care group.\n\n Lopinavir–ritonavir treatment was stopped early in 13 patients (13.8%) because of adverse events.\n\n\nConclusions\nIn hospitalized adult patients with severe Covid-19, no benefit was observed with lopinavir–ritonavir treatment beyond standard care.\n\n Future trials in patients with severe illness may help to confirm

Disease occurrence among men (260 cases [62%]) was higher than in women (162 cases [38%]), and the case fatality rate was higher for men (52%) than for women (23%).\n\n In addition, those in the 45–59 years and ?60 years age groups were most likely to be infected, and the case fatality rate for these people was higher than for other groups.\n\n The highest number of cases and deaths were reported in Riyadh (169 cases; 43 deaths), followed by Jeddah (156 cases; 36 deaths) and the Eastern Region (24 cases; 22 deaths).\n\n The highest case fatality rate was in the Eastern Region (92%), followed by Medinah (36%) and Najran (33%).\n\n MERS-CoV infection actively causes disease in environments with low relative humidity (&lt;20%) and high temperature (15°C–35°C).\n\n\nConclusion\nMERS-CoV is considered an epidemic in Saudi Arabia.\n\n The frequency of cases and deaths is higher among men than women, and those above 45 years of age are most affected.\n\n Low relative humidity and high temperature can enhance the spread of this disease in the entire population.\n\n Further analytical studies are required to determine the source and mode of infection in Saudi Arabia.\n\n\n","id":"PMC4149400","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Dove Medical Press","authors":[{"firstname":"Ibrahim G","surname":"Alghamdi","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Issam I","surname":"Hussain","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Shaia S","surname":"Almalki","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Mohamed S","surname":"Alghamdi","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Mansour M","surname":"Alghamdi","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Mohammed A","surname":"El-Sheemy","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"[The epidemiological characteristics of an outbreak of 2019 novel coronavirus diseases (COVID-19) in China]","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.4049/jimmunol.1601896","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Sex-Based Differences in Susceptibility to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus Infection","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1016/j.maturitas.2015.05.004","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Immunosenescence: Implications for response to infection and vaccination in older people","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Asians Do Not Exhibit Elevated Expression or Unique Genetic Polymorphisms for ACE2, the Cell-Entry Receptor of SARS-CoV-2","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1016/S0140-6736(20)30154-9","date":"1970-01-01","title":"A familial cluster of pneumonia associated with the 2019 novel coronavirus indicating person-to-person transmission: a study of a family cluster","abstract":"Background\nAn ongoing outbreak of pneumonia associated with a novel coronavirus was reported in Wuhan city, Hubei province, China.\n\n Affected patients were geographically linked with a local wet market as a potential source.\n\n No data on person-to-person or nosocomial transmission have been published to date.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this study, we report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, radiological, and microbiological findings of five patients in a family cluster who presented with unexplained pneumonia after returning to Shenzhen, Guangdong province, China, after a visit to Wuhan, and an additional family member who did not travel to Wuhan.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of genetic sequences from these patients were done.\n\n\nFindings\nFrom Jan 10, 2020, we enrolled a family of six patients who travelled to Wuhan from Shenzhen between Dec 29, 2019 and Jan 4, 2020. Of six family members who travelled to Wuhan, five were identified as infected with the novel coronavirus.\n\n Additionally, one family member, who did not travel to Wuhan, became infected with the virus after several days of contact with four of the family members.\n\n None of the family members had contacts with Wuhan markets or animals, although two had visited a Wuhan hospital.\n\n Five family members (aged 36–66 years) presented with fever, upper or lower respiratory tract symptoms, or diarrhoea, or a combination of these 3–6 days after exposure.\n\n They presented to our hospital (The University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen) 6–10 days after symptom onset.\n\n They and one asymptomatic child (aged 10 years) had radiological ground-glass lung opacities.\n\n Older patients (aged &gt;60 years) had more systemic symptoms, extensive radiological ground-glass lung changes, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and increased C-reactive protein and lactate dehydrogenase levels.\n\n The nasopharyngeal or throat swabs of these six patients were negative for known respiratory microbes by point-of-care multiplex RT-PCR, but five patients (four adults and the child) were RT-PCR positive for genes encoding the internal RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and surface Spike protein of this novel coronavirus, which were confirmed by Sanger sequencing.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these five patients' RT-PCR amplicons and two full genomes by next-generation sequencing showed that this is a novel coronavirus, which is closest to the bat severe acute respiatory syndrome (SARS)-related coronaviruses found in Chinese horseshoe bats.\n\n\nInterpretation\nOur findings are consistent with person-to-person transmission of this novel coronavirus in hospital and family settings, and the reports of infected travellers in other geographical regions.\n\n\nFunding\nThe Shaw Foundation Hong Kong, Michael Seak-Kan Tong, Respiratory Viral Research Foundation Limited, Hui

that implies vulnerability.\n\n The links between frailty and adverse outcomes such as death and institutionalisation have been widely evidenced.\n\n There is currently no gold standard frailty assessment tool; optimizing the assessment of frailty in older people therefore remains a research priority.\n\n The objective of this systematic review is to identify existing multi-component frailty assessment tools that were specifically developed to assess frailty in adults aged ?60 years old and to systematically and critically evaluate the reliability and validity of these tools.\n\n\nMethods\nA systematic literature review was conducted using the standardised COnsensus?based Standards for the selection of health Measurement INstruments (COSMIN) checklist to assess the methodological quality of included studies.\n\n\nResults\nFive thousand sixty-three studies were identified in total: 73 of which were included for review.\n\n 38 multi-component frailty assessment tools were identified: Reliability and validity data were available for 21 % (8/38) of tools.\n\n Only 5 % (2/38) of the frailty assessment tools had evidence of reliability and validity that was within statistically significant parameters and of fair-excellent methodological quality (the Frailty Index-Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment [FI-CGA] and the Tilburg Frailty Indicator [TFI]).\n\n\nConclusions\nThe TFI has the most robust evidence of reliability and validity and has been the most extensively examined in terms of psychometric properties.\n\n However, there is insufficient evidence at present to determine the best tool for use in research and clinical practice.\n\n Further in-depth evaluation of the psychometric properties of these tools is required before

reliable measure of frailty for a community dwelling older population","abstract":"Background\nFrailty remains an elusive concept despite many efforts to define and measure it.\n\n The difficulty in translating the clinical profile of frail elderly people into a quantifiable assessment tool is due to the complex and heterogeneous nature of their health problems.\n\n Viewing frailty as a 'latent vulnerability' in older people this study aims to derive a model based measurement of frailty and examines its internal reliability in community dwelling elderly.\n\n\nMethod\nThe British Women's Heart and Health Study (BWHHS) cohort of 4286 women aged 60-79 years from 23 towns in Britain provided 35 frailty indicators expressed as binary categorical variables.\n\n These indicators were corrected for measurement error and assigned relative weights in its association with frailty.\n\n Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) reduced the data to a smaller number of factors and was subjected to confirmatory factor analysis (CFA)which restricted the model by fitting the EFA-driven structure to observed data.\n\n Cox regression analysis compared the hazard ratios for adverse outcomes of the newly developed British frailty index (FI) with a widely known FI.\n\n This process was replicated in the MRC Assessment study of older people, a larger cohort drawn from 106 general practices in Britain.\n\n\nResults\nSeven factors explained the association between frailty indicators: physical ability, cardiac symptoms/disease, respiratory symptoms/disease, physiological measures, psychological problems, co-morbidities and visual impairment.\n\n Based on existing concepts and statistical indices of fit, frailty was best described using a General Specific Model.\n\n The British FI would serve as a better population metric than the FI as it enables people with varying degrees of frailty to be better distinguished over a wider range of scores.\n\n The British FI was a better independent predictor of all-cause mortality, hospitalization and institutionalization than the FI in both cohorts.\n\n\nConclusions\nFrailty is a multidimensional concept represented by a wide range of latent (not directly observed) attributes.\n\n This new measure provides more precise information than is currently recognized, of which cluster of frailty indicators are important in older people.\n\n This study could potentially improve quality of life among older people through targeted efforts in early prevention and treatment of frailty.\n\n\n","id":"PMC2988728","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"BioMed

unnecessary assessment of healthy people.\n\n This study investigates the predictive validity of three self-report instruments for identifying community-dwelling frail elderly.\n\n\nMethods\nThis is a prospective study with 1-year follow-up among community-dwelling elderly aged 70 or older (n = 430) to test sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predicted values of the Groningen Frailty Indicator, Tilburg Frailty Indicator and Sherbrooke Postal Questionnaire on development of disabilities, hospital admission and mortality.\n\n Odds ratios were calculated to compare frail versus non-frail groups for their risk for the adverse outcomes.\n\n\nResults\nAdjusted odds ratios show that those identified as frail have more than twice the risk (GFI, 2.62; TFI, 2.00; SPQ, 2,49) for developing disabilities compared to the non-frail group; those identified as frail by the TFI and SPQ have more than twice the risk of being admitted to a hospital.\n\n Sensitivity and specificity for development of disabilities are 71% and 63% (GFI), 62% and 71% (TFI) and 83% and 48% (SPQ).\n\n Regarding mortality, sensitivity for all tools are about 70% and specificity between 41% and 61%.\n\n For hospital admission, SPQ scores the highest for sensitivity (76%).\n\n\nConclusion\nAll three instruments do have potential to identify older persons at risk, but their predictive power is not sufficient yet.\n\n Further research on these and other instruments is needed to improve targeting frail elderly.\n\n\n","id":"PMC3293057","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"BioMed

community-dwelling older people","abstract":"Background\nDue to the rapidly increasing number of older people worldwide, the prevalence of frailty among older adults is expected to escalate in coming decades.\n\n It is crucial to recognize early onset symptoms to initiate specific preventive care.\n\n Therefore, early detection of frailty with appropriate screening instruments is needed.\n\n The aim of this study was to evaluate the underlying dimensionality of the Groningen Frailty Indicator (GFI), a widely used self-report screening instrument for identifying frail older adults.\n\n In addition, criterion validity of GFI subscales was examined and composition of GFI scores was evaluated.\n\n\nMethods\nA cross-sectional study design was used to evaluate the structural validity, internal consistency and criterion validity of the GFI questionnaire in older adults aged 65 years and older.\n\n All subjects completed the GFI questionnaire (n?=?1508).\n\n To assess criterion validity, a smaller sample of 119 older adults completed additional questionnaires: De Jong Gierveld Loneliness Scale, Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale, RAND-36 physical functioning, and perceived general health item of the EuroQol-5D.\n\n Exploratory factor analysis and Mokken scale analysis were used to evaluate the structural validity of the GFI.\n\n A Venn diagram was constructed to show the composition of GFI subscale scores for frail subjects.\n\n\nResults\nThe factor structure of the GFI supported a three-dimensional structure of the scale.\n\n The subscales Daily Activities and Psychosocial Functioning showed good internal consistency, scalability, and criterion validity (Daily Activities: Cronbach’s ??=?0.81, Hs?=?.\n\n84, r?=??.\n\n62; Psychosocial Functioning: Cronbach’s ??=?0.80, Hs?=?.\n\n35, r?=??.\n\n48).\n\n The subscale Health Problems showed less strong internal consistency but acceptable scalability and criterion validity (Cronbach’s ??=?.\n\n57, Hs?=?.\n\n35, r?=??.\n\n48).\n\n The present data suggest that 90% of the frail older adults experience problems in the Psychosocial Functioning domain.\n\n\nConclusions\nThe present findings support a three-dimensional factor structure of the GFI, suggesting that a multidimensional assessment of frailty with the GFI is possible.\n\n These GFI subscale scores produce a richer assessment of frailty than with a single overall sum GFI score, and likely their use will contribute to more directed and customized care for older adults.\n\n\n","id":"PMC3766248","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"BioMed

Older Persons with Frailty Syndrome in the Absence of Mobility Disability: The FiND Questionnaire","abstract":"Background\nThe “frailty syndrome” (a geriatric multidimensional condition characterized by decreased reserve and diminished resistance to stressors) represents a promising target of preventive interventions against disability in elders.\n\n Available screening tools for the identification of frailty in the absence of disability present major limitations.\n\n In particular, they have to be administered by a trained assessor, require special equipment, and/or do not discriminate between frail and disabled individuals.\n\n Aim of this study is to verify the agreement of a novel self-reported questionnaire (the “Frail Non-Disabled” [FiND] instrument) designed for detecting non-mobility disabled frail older persons with results from reference tools.\n\n\nMethodology/Principal Findings\nData are from 45 community-dwelling individuals aged ?60 years.\n\n Participants were asked to complete the FiND questionnaire separately exploring the frailty and disability domains.\n\n Then, a blinded assessor objectively measured the frailty status (using the phenotype proposed by Fried and colleagues) and mobility disability (using the 400-meter walk test).\n\n Cohen's kappa coefficients were calculated to determine the agreement between the FiND questionnaire with the reference instruments.\n\n Mean age of participants (women 62.2%) was 72.5 (standard deviation 8.2) years.\n\n Seven (15.6%) participants presented mobility disability as being unable to complete the 400-meter walk test.\n\n According to the frailty phenotype criteria, 25 (55.6%) participants were pre-frail or frail, and 13 (28.9%) were robust.\n\n Overall, a substantial agreement of the instrument with the reference tools (kappa?=?0.748, quadratic weighted kappa?=?0.836, both p values&lt;0.001) was reported with only 7 (15.6%) participants incorrectly categorized.\n\n The agreement between results of the FiND disability domain and the 400-meter walk test was excellent (kappa?=?0.920, p&lt;0.001).\n\n\nConclusions/Significance\nThe FiND questionnaire presents a very good capacity to correctly identify frail older persons without mobility disability living in the community.\n\n This screening tool may represent an opportunity for diffusing awareness about frailty and disability and supporting specific preventive campaigns.\n\n\n","id":"PMC4084999","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Public Library of

elderly.\n\n However, current status and clinical significance of frailty have not been evaluated for the Korean elderly population.\n\n We aimed to investigate the usefulness of established frailty criteria for community-dwelling Korean elderly.\n\n We also tried to develop and validate a new frailty index based on a multidimensional model.\n\n\nMethods\nWe studied 693 participants of the Korean Longitudinal Study on Health and Aging (KLoSHA).\n\n We developed a new frailty index (KLoSHA Frailty Index, KFI) and compared predictability of it with the established frailty indexes from the Cardiovascular Health Study (CHS) and Study of Osteoporotic Fracture (SOF).\n\n Mortality, hospitalization, and functional decline were evaluated.\n\n\nResults\nThe prevalence of frailty was 9.2% (SOF index), 13.2% (CHS index), and 15.6% (KFI).\n\n The criteria from CHS and KFI correlated with each other, but SOF did not correlate with KFI.\n\n During the follow-up period (5.6±0.9 years), 97 participants (14.0%) died.\n\n Frailty defined by KFI predicted mortality better than CHS index (c-index: 0.713 and 0.596, respectively; p&lt;0.001, better for KFI).\n\n In contrast, frailty by SOF

index development","abstract":"Background\nNumerous multidimensional assessment tools have been developed to measure frailty; however, the clinical feasibility of these tools is limited.\n\n We previously developed and validated an upper-extremity function (UEF) assessment method that incorporates wearable motion sensors.\n\n The purpose of the current study was to: 1) cross-sectionally validate the UEF method in a larger sample in comparison with the Fried index; 2) develop a UEF frailty index to predict frailty categories including non-frail, pre-frail, and frail based on UEF parameters and demographic information, using the Fried index as the gold standard; and 3) develop a UEF continuous score (points scores for each UEF parameter and a total frailty score) based on UEF parameters and demographic information, using the Fried index as the gold standard.\n\n\nMethods\nWe performed a cross-sectional validation and index development study within the Banner Medical Center, Tucson, and Banner Sun Health Research Institute, Sun City, Arizona.\n\n Community-dwelling and outpatient older adults (?60 years; n = 352; 132 non-frail, 175 pre-frail, and 45 frail based on Fried criteria) were recruited.\n\n For the UEF test, each participant performed a 20-s elbow flexion, within which they repetitively and rapidly flexed and extended their dominant elbow.\n\n Using elbow motion outcomes two UEF indexes were developed (categorical and score).\n\n The Fried index was measured as the gold standard.\n\n\nResults\nFor the categorical index, speed of elbow flexion, elbow range of motion, elbow moment, number of flexion, speed variability and reduction within 20 s, as well as body mass index (BMI) were included as the pre-frailty/frailty predictor parameters.\n\n Results from 10-fold cross-validation showed receiver operator characteristic area under the curve of 0.77 ± 0.07 and 0.80 ± 0.12 for predicting Fried pre-frailty and frailty, respectively.\n\n UEF score (0.1 to 1.0) was developed using similar UEF parameters.\n\n\nConclusions\nWe present an objective, sensor-based frailty assessment tool based on physical frailty features including slowness, weakness, exhaustion (muscle fatigue), and flexibility of upper-extremity movements.\n\n Within the current study, the method was validated cross-sectionally using the Fried index as the gold standard and the UEF categorical index and UEF frailty score were developed for research purposes and potentially for future clinical use.\n\n\nElectronic supplementary material\nThe online version of this

of Deficits as a Proxy Measure of Aging","abstract":"This paper develops a method for appraising health status in elderly people.\n A frailty index was defined as the proportion of accumulated deficits (symptoms, signs, functional impairments, and laboratory abnormalities).\n It serves as an individual state variable, reflecting severity of illness and proximity to death.\n In a representative database of elderly Canadians we found that deficits accumulated at 3% per year, and show a gamma distribution, typical for systems with redundant components that can be used in case of failure of a given subsystem.\n Of note, the slope of the index is insensitive to the individual nature of the deficits, and serves as an important prognostic factor for life expectancy.\n The formula for estimating an individual's life span given the frailty index value is presented.\n For different patterns of cognitive impairments the average within-group index value increases with the severity of the cognitive impairment, and the relative variability of the index is significantly reduced.\n Finally, the statistical distribution of the frailty index sharply differs between well groups (gamma distribution) and morbid groups (normal distribution).\n This pattern reflects an increase in uncompensated deficits in impaired organisms, which would lead to illness of various etiologies, and ultimately to increased mortality.\n The accumulation of deficits is as an example of a macroscopic variable, i.\ne.\n, one that reflects general properties of aging at the level of the whole organism rather than any given functional deficiency.\n In consequence, we propose that it may be used as a proxy measure of aging.\n","id":"PMC6084020","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"TheScientificWorldJOURNAL","authors":[{"firstname":"Arnold

Geriatr Gerontol Int 2020;   :   -  .\nIntroduction\nSince the first case was identified in Wuhan city (China) in December 2019, the novel coronavirus designated SARS-CoV-2, has caused an international outbreak of respiratory illness named coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The spectrum of COVID-19 is various, ranging from possible asymptomatic patients to severe progressive pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome leading to death. \nAfter the first case of COVID-19 was diagnosed in the Lombardy region of Italy, in February, one of the largest and most serious clusters of COVID-19 in the world struck the Italian nation. Despite an aggressive effort of containment put in place, the disease continues to spread and the number of affected patients is still rising; furthermore, the case fatality rate has been very high and dominated by older patients. \nItaly presents one of the highest life expectancies in the world, which is at birth 80.3 years for men and 84.9 years for women. In Italy, people aged &gt;65 years now represent approximately 22.6% of the population, and older adults aged &gt;=80 years represent 6.5% of the total population. \nThe overall estimated case fatality rate of COVID-19 in Italy is 7.2%; however, the median age for all COVID-19 related death is 81 years (73-86 years), and the case fatality rate in patients aged &gt;=80 years is &gt;20%. Nevertheless, up to now, limited data are available for COVID-19 in older patients, and no reports have focused on patients aged &gt;=80 years. \nThe aim of the present study was to describe the clinical presentation of patients aged &gt;=80 years with COVID-19, and provide insights regarding the prognostic factors and the risk stratification in this distinctive population.\nMethods\n Study design \nThis was a single-center, retrospective, observational study carried out in an urban teaching hospital, which is a referral center for COVID-19, in central Italy. We reviewed the clinical records of all the patients aged &gt;=80 years consecutively admitted to our emergency department (ED) for suspected COVID-19 over a 1-month period (1-31 March 2020). COVID-19 was diagnosed based on the World Health Organization interim guidance. We included in the analysis only patients with a positive result on real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction assay of nasal and pharyngeal swab specimens.\nWe excluded from the study cohort patients discharged from ED, and patients already on orotracheal intubation at ED arrival. For patients with more than one admission, only the latest access was included in the analysis.\n Study variables \nPhysiological parameters: age, sex, temperature, heart rate, respiratory rate, blood pressure, Glasgow Coma Scale score, oxygen supplementation and peripheral oxygen saturation (pO2). Based on physiological parameters, we calculated the National Early Warning Score for all patients.\nSymptoms at admission: fever (core temperature &gt;37.5 C), dyspnea, cough, fatigue or other (including sore throat, headache, diarrhea, abdominal pain, dysgeusia).\nRadiographic findings: based on chest X-ray or CT scan obtained in ED, patients were categorized as normal, monolateral ground-glass opacity or interstitial involvement and bilateral pneumonia.\nLaboratory findings: hemoglobin, total white cell blood count, serum creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, alanine aminotransferase, lactate dehydrogenase, fibrinogen, prothrombin time, D-dimer, ferritin, C-reactive protein (CRP) and procalcitonin.\nPatient disease presentation in ED: categorized as mild for normal X-ray findings, severe for positive S-ray and pO2 &gt;=92%, and critical for positive X-ray and pO2 &lt;92%.\nClinical history: coronary artery disease or congestive heart failure, hypertension, diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, severe dementia, malignancy and institution residency.\nWe extracted from computerized clinical records clinical, laboratory and radiological findings at admission. We included in the analysis the following: \n Study end-points \nThe primary study end-point was the patient's death. Survival follow up was assessed at 30 days from admission.\n Statistical analysis \nContinuous variables are reported as the median (interquartile range), and are compared at univariate analysis by Mann-Whitney U-test. Categorical variables are reported as the absolute number (percentage), and are compared by the chi2-test (with Fisher's test if appropriate).\nWe compared the clinical and laboratory variables by a univariate Cox analysis (proportional hazards regression) for their association with survival. The post-hoc analysis was made by log-rank test. We entered significant parameters at univariate analysis into a multivariate Cox regression model to identify independent predictors of death. For a better model fitting and hazard estimation, we categorized the continuous variables into dichotomous parameters (i.e. low/high). For each variable, we obtained the optimal dividing cut-off by Youden's index, carrying out a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis with respect to association with death. Survival curves were estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method. We regarded a two-sided P-value &lt;=0.05 as significant. Data were analyzed by spss v25 (IBM, Chicago, IL, USA) and Medcalc 18.2 (MedCalc Software, Ostend, Belgium).\n Statement of ethics \nThe study was carried out in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki, and was approved by the local ethics committee.\nResults\nA total of 69 patients, aged 80-98 years, met the inclusion criteria and were included in the study cohort. The median age was 84 years (82-89 years is interquartile range); 37 patients (53.6%) were men. Globally, 14 patients (20.3%) presented a mild, 30 (43.5%) a severe and 25 (36.2%) a critical COVID-19 disease (Table 1). Overall, 23 patients died. Interestingly, the age and sex distribution were similar between the patients who survived and died (Table 1).\nClinical and demographic characteristics of patients aged &gt;=80 years included in the study cohort\nVariable	All population (n = 69)	Survived (n = 46)	Died (n = 23)	P	 	Age (years)	84 (82-89)	84 (81-89)	85 (83-86)	0.858	 	Sex (male)	37 (53.6%)	25 (54.3%)	12 (52.2%)	0.864	 	Ed presentation					 	Heart rate (min-1)	85 (75-95)	83 (75-92)	87 (73-107)	0.404	 	Systolic BP (mmHg)	127 (111-140)	130 (112-140)	122 (100-137)	0.132	 	Diastolic BP (mmHg)	75 (65-89)	78 (65-90)	68 (60-86)	0.183	 	pO2 (%)	94 (90-96)	95 (93-96)	89 (82-94)	0.001	 	Temperature ( C)	36 (35.5-36.5)	36 (35.5-36.5)	36.2 (35.7-36.8)	0.596	 	GCS	15 (15-15)	15 (15-15)	15 (15-15)	0.202	 	NEWS &gt;=3	41 (59.4%)	24 (52.2%)	17 (73.9%)	0.083	 	Symptoms					 	Fever	56 (81.2%)	56 (81.2%)	56 (81.2%)	0.663	 	Dyspnea	32 (46.4%)	13 (28.3%)	19 (82.6%)	&lt;0.001	 	Cough	29 (42.0%)	22 (47.8%)	7 (30.4%)	0.168	 	Fatigue	8 (11.6%)	6 (13.0%)	2 (8.7)	0.595	 	Other	11 (15.9%)	7 (15.2%)	5 (21.7%)	0.500	 	Clinical history					 	CHF/CAD	21 (30.4%)	14 (30.4%)	7 (30.4%)	1.000	 	Hypertension	41 (59.4%)	31 (67.4%)	10 (43.5%)	0.057	 	Cerebrovascular disease	20 (29.0%)	11 (23.9%)	9 (39.1%)	0.189	 	Diabetes	9 (13.0%)	7 (15.2%)	2 (8.7%)	0.448	 	COPD	7 (10.1%)	3 (6.5%)	4 (17.4%)	0.159	 	Severe dementia	8 (11.6%)	2 (4.3%)	6 (26.1%)	0.014	 	Malignancy	3 (4.3%)	2 (4.3%)	1 (4.3%)	1.000	 	Living in institution	17 (24.6%)	11 (23.9%)	6 (26.1%)	0.843	 	Radiology					 	Negative	8 (11.6%)	7 (15.2%)	1 (4.3%)		 	Monolateral pneumonia	29 (42.0%)	20 (43.5%)	9 (39.1%)	0.302	 	Bilateral pneumonia	32 (46.4%)	19 (41.3%)	13 (56.5%)		 	Severity classification					 	Mild	14 (20.3%)	13 (28.3%)	1 (4.3%)		 	Severe	30 (43.5%)	22 (47.8%)	8 (34.8%)	0.005	 	Critical	25 (36.2%)	11 (23.9%)	14 (60.9%)		 	Outcome					 	ICU admission	11 (15.9%)	4 (8.7%)	7 (30.4%)	0.034	 	Survival time (days)	26 (11-35)	35 (32-39)	5 (2-13)	-	 	Deaths	23 (33.3%)			-	 	\n\nP-values are shown with regard to comparison between patients who survived and died. Survival follow up was assessed at 30 days from emergency department admission. BP, blood pressure; CAD, coronary artery disease; CHF, congestive heart failure; COPD, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; GCS, Glasgow Coma Scale; ICU, intensive care unit; NEWS, National Early Warning Score; pO2, peripheral oxygen saturation.\nClinical history was quite homogeneous among the patients, and the patients who survived did not present relevant differences compared with those who died. However, the patients who died presented more frequently a history of severe dementia (Table 1). As expected, the disease severity classification in ED was associated with outcome: among the patients who died, 14 (60.9%) had a critical, eight (34.8%) a severe and just one patient had a mild presentation. Disease progression was quite fast in the patients who died. The median survival time for non-survivors was 5 days (2-13 days is interquartile range).\nAmong physiological parameters at admission, pO2 was the only parameter significantly associated with death in the present cohort. For as laboratory values, patients who died had higher blood urea nitrogen, lactate dehydrogenase, CRP and procalcitonin levels (Table 2). By using the ROC analysis with regard to these continuous variables, we found the best cut-off values discriminating death occurrence. Values were pO2 &lt;=90% (AUC 0.748 [0.608-0.889], P = 0.001), blood urea nitrogen &gt;37 mg/dL (AUC 0.680 [0.526-0.835], P = 0.023), CRP &gt;112 mg/dL (AUC 0.717 [0.577-0.857], P = 0.006) and lactate dehydrogenase &gt;464 U/L (AUC 0.708 [0.561-0.855]). The best discriminating value for procalcitonin was &gt;0.19 ng/mL; however, we did not include it in the multivariate model, as we had 14 missing values.\nLaboratory values of patients aged &gt;=80 years in the study cohort\nLaboratory	Reference value	Entire population (n = 69)	Survived (n = 46)	Died (n = 23)	P	 	Haematology						 	Hemoglobin (g/dL)	13.0-16.0	13.2 (11.9-14.5)	13.2 (11.9-14.3)	13.2 (11.7-14.7)	0.784	 	White cell blood count (x109/L)	3.5-9.5	5.78 (4.55-7.67)	5.78 (4.83-7.50)	5.93 (3.94-8.27)	0.636	 	Biochemistry						 	Creatinine (mg/dL)	0.67-1.17	1.05 (0.88-1.52)	1.03 (0.88-1.32)	1.45 (0.88-2.05)	0.068	 	Blood urea nitrogen (mg/dL)	10-23	22 (17-38)	20 (16-31)	39 (20-58)	0.006	 	Alanine aminotransferase (U/L)	7-45	19 (14-32)	18 (13-27)	21 (15-53)	0.175	 	Lactate dehydrogenase (U/L)	&lt;250	322 (269-480)	305 (239-409)	511 (297-724)	0.005	 	Blood coagulation						 	Prothrombin time (s)	11-13	11.3 (18.8-11.9)	11.2 (10.9-11.9)	11.4 (10.8-12.6)	0.678	 	Fibrinogen (mg/dL)	200-400	478 (375-551)	475 (372-530)	497 (394-649)	0.225	 	D-dimer (ng/mL)	&lt;500	1446 (916-4729)	1374 (946-4824)	1875 (834-5090)	0.962	 	Inflammatory markers						 	C-reactive protein (mg/dL)	&lt;5	88.1 (33.2-156.7)	62.4 (28.1-102.6)	145.7 (77.9-210.5)	0.002	 	Procalcitonin (ng/mL)	&lt;0.5	0.11 (0.00-0.35) 	0.06 (0.00-0.18) 	0.29 (0.11-0.55) 	0.001	 	Ferritin (ng/mL)	12-240	732 (493-1267)	721 (413-1302)	806 (566-1381)	0.888	 	\nThe P-value comparison is shown for differences between patients who survived and patients who died.\nA total of 14 procalcitonin values are missing: nine among patients who survived and five among patients who died.\nMultivariate Cox regression analysis showed that severe dementia, pO2 &lt;=90 at admission and lactate dehydrogenase &gt;464 U/L were independent risk factors for survival in these patients (Fig. 1).\nMultivariate Cox regression for prognostic factors. The forest plot graphically represents hazard ratios (95% confidence interval) for peripheral oxygen saturation (pO2), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), C-reactive protein (CRP) and dementia. All parameters were assessed at emergency department admission.\nDiscussion\nThe present study evaluated the clinical course and risk factors for patients aged &gt;80 years affected by COVID-19. Our data suggest that for patients aged &gt;=80 years, further increasing age is not a risk factor for survival, whereas a history of severe dementia, low pO2 at admission, high CRP and lactate dehydrogenase &gt;464 U/L are risk factors for death.\nUntil 2002, four coronavirus were known to infect humans, and they globally accounted for 10-30% of upper respiratory tract infections in adults, with mild clinical consequences. The outbreak of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV caused international alarm, whereas the factors associated with transmission of these human coronaviruses remain poorly understood. Similar to SARS-CoV, the SARS-CoV-2 binds to human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) for cell entry. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 is a membrane protein expressed in the lung, heart, kidney and intestine. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 is largely expressed in the upper and lower respiratory tract, and this could explain both the infectivity and lethality of Sars-Cov2. \nThere is clear evidence that older patients are at higher risk of death from COVID-19. Italian national data show an overall mortality rate of 12.6%. However, mortality steeply increases with age; for patients aged &lt;50 years it is &lt;1%, in the fifth decade it is 2.6%, in the sixth decade it is 9.8%, in the seventh decade it rises to 24.2% and in the eighth decade it rises to 29.0%. Interestingly, the mortality rate decreases to 24.7% in people aged &gt;=90 years. The present data, although in a limited sample, appear to confirm this tendency. We found, in the present cohort of people aged &gt;=80 years, that increasing age does not represent a risk factor for death. Whether this is due to a minor susceptibility of patients aged &gt;90 years to Sars-CoV-2 infection damage, or possibly to a reduced secondary lung inflammation, should be further investigated.\nAs the Sars-Cov2 cell entry receptor is located mainly in the lungs, more than half of patients might develop dyspnea, and &gt;10% might require ventilatory support. With acute hypoxia being the main determinant of disease progression and severity, the pO2 at admission is crucial for death risk stratification. The present data confirm that patients aged &gt;=80 years who are severely hypoxic at ED admission (pO2 &lt;90%) have an increased risk of death. However, a pO2 &lt;=90% was not associated with death in the present cohort at multivariate analysis. Certainly, the reduced sample and the subsequent wide confidence interval of our hazard estimation could not provide final clues on this point. Indeed, the present patients were mainly severe and critical at admission, thus reducing the relative influence of hypoxia on our final hazard estimation.\nAn elevation of lactate dehydrogenase in COVID-19 patients who died was found in most of the studies currently available. These observations appear to be consistent with SARS, where multivariate analysis identified elevated lactate dehydrogenase as a marker associated with worse outcomes. However, lactate dehydrogenase is a non-specific marker, which is commonly found in critically ill patients. Nevertheless, the present data confirm that &gt;464 U/L could be a relevant prognostic factor in patients aged &gt;=80 years affected by COVID-19.\nThe CRP level correlates to inflammation, and its concentration is not affected by age, sex and physical condition. CRP is a well-known index of severe pulmonary infections, and CRP levels were shown to positively correlate with lung lesions and disease severity in COVID-19. The present data suggest that elevated CRP could have a predictive role in oldest-old patients with COVID-19; however, because of the small sample size in the present study, an association between elevated CRP and an increased risk of death cannot be established with certainty.\nA distinct aspect of the present study is the association between dementia and poor outcome. Indeed, medical assistance to COVID-19 patients could be extremely difficult for patients with dementia. First, the new hospital environment can lead to increased stress and behavioral problems in these patients. Second, hypoxia, which is a prominent clinical feature of COVID-19, could complicate the presentation of dementia and induce delirium, increasing the need for medical care, and the need for dementia support. \nThe outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic has raised great concerns for the &gt;50 million people living with dementia worldwide. These people might have difficulties in remembering safeguard procedures, such as wearing masks, and self-quarantine measures could not apply to patients who are not self-sufficient. Finally, long-term care facilities for dementia patients are at extreme risk for COVID-19 infection. The present data suggest that severe dementia itself is an independent risk factor for survival in COVID-19 patients aged &gt;=80 years. Thus, as recommended by Alzheimer's Disease International, specific support for people living with dementia and their caregivers is urgently required, worldwide. \nAs for any retrospective study, several limitations of the present study are worth considering. First, our sample size was small, thus limiting the power of our analysis. Furthermore, we carried out the study at a single institution, and as such, the findings might be not representative of the general population of COVID-19 patients aged &gt;=80 years . Finally, the study focused on patient deaths. For this reason, we cannot extrapolate relevant outcomes for this population, such as permanent need for oxygen support, loss of autonomy or the need to transfer to a residential nursing facility.\nPatients aged &gt;=80 years are the most at risk of a poor outcome for COVID-19. Nevertheless, to date, scarce data are available about the distinctive expression of disease in this frailer part of the population. Although carried out in a small sample, the present study could give relevant clues on clinical risk factors for COVID-19 in patients aged &gt;=80 years. The present data suggest that the might could be not age dependent in this population. Furthermore, dementia appears to be one of the most relevant risk factors for death. Severe COVID-19, as expressed by elevated lactate dehydrogenase, elevated CRP and low oxygen saturation at admission, is associated with a rapid progression to death in these patients.\nDisclosure statement\nThe authors declare no conflict of interest.\nReferences\nChina medical treatment expert group for COVID-19.

associated with a novel coronavirus was reported in Wuhan city, Hubei province, China.\n\n Affected patients were geographically linked with a local wet market as a potential source.\n\n No data on person-to-person or nosocomial transmission have been published to date.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this study, we report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, radiological, and microbiological findings of five patients in a family cluster who presented with unexplained pneumonia after returning to Shenzhen, Guangdong province, China, after a visit to Wuhan, and an additional family member who did not travel to Wuhan.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of genetic sequences from these patients were done.\n\n\nFindings\nFrom Jan 10, 2020, we enrolled a family of six patients who travelled to Wuhan from Shenzhen between Dec 29, 2019 and Jan 4, 2020. Of six family members who travelled to Wuhan, five were identified as infected with the novel coronavirus.\n\n Additionally, one family member, who did not travel to Wuhan, became infected with the virus after several days of contact with four of the family members.\n\n None of the family members had contacts with Wuhan markets or animals, although two had visited a Wuhan hospital.\n\n Five family members (aged 36–66 years) presented with fever, upper or lower respiratory tract symptoms, or diarrhoea, or a combination of these 3–6 days after exposure.\n\n They presented to our hospital (The University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen) 6–10 days after symptom onset.\n\n They and one asymptomatic child (aged 10 years) had radiological ground-glass lung opacities.\n\n Older patients (aged &gt;60 years) had more systemic symptoms, extensive radiological ground-glass lung changes, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and increased C-reactive protein and lactate dehydrogenase levels.\n\n The nasopharyngeal or throat swabs of these six patients were negative for known respiratory microbes by point-of-care multiplex RT-PCR, but five patients (four adults and the child) were RT-PCR positive for genes encoding the internal RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and surface Spike protein of this novel coronavirus, which were confirmed by Sanger sequencing.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these five patients' RT-PCR amplicons and two full genomes by next-generation sequencing showed that this is a novel coronavirus, which is closest to the bat severe acute respiatory syndrome

outcomes in patients with a number of different malignancies.\n\n The objective of this study was to assess the relationship between NLR and mortality in a population of adult critically ill patients.\n\n\nMethods\nWe performed an observational cohort study of unselected intensive care unit (ICU) patients based on records in a large clinical database.\n\n We computed individual patient NLR and categorized patients by quartile of this ratio.\n\n The association of NLR quartiles and 28-day mortality was assessed using multivariable logistic regression.\n\n Secondary outcomes included mortality in the ICU, in-hospital mortality and 1-year mortality.\n\n An a priori subgroup analysis of patients with versus without sepsis was performed to assess any differences in the relationship between the NLR and outcomes in these cohorts.\n\n\nResults\nA total of 5,056 patients were included.\n\n Their 28-day mortality rate was 19%.\n\n The median age of the cohort was 65 years, and 47% were female.\n\n The median NLR for the entire cohort was 8.9 (interquartile range, 4.99 to 16.21).\n\n Following multivariable adjustments, there was a stepwise increase in mortality with increasing quartiles of NLR (first quartile: reference category; second quartile odds ratio (OR) = 1.32; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.03 to 1.71; third quartile OR = 1.43; 95% CI, 1.12 to 1.83; 4th quartile OR = 1.71; 95% CI, 1.35 to 2.16).\n\n A similar stepwise relationship was identified in the subgroup of patients who presented without sepsis.\n\n The NLR was not associated with 28-day mortality in patients with sepsis.\n\n Increasing quartile of NLR was statistically significantly associated with secondary outcome.\n\n\nConclusion\nThe NLR is associated with outcomes in unselected critically ill patients.\n\n In patients with sepsis, there was no statistically significant relationship between NLR and mortality.\n\n Further investigation is required to increase understanding of the pathophysiology of this relationship and to validate these findings with data collected prospectively.\n\n\nElectronic supplementary material\nThe online version of this article

the Central Hospital of Wuhan on 26 December 2019 while experiencing a severe respiratory syndrome that included fever, dizziness and a cough.\n Metagenomic RNA sequencing4 of a sample of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from the patient identified a new RNA virus strain from the family Coronaviridae, which is designated here ‘WH-Human 1’ coronavirus (and has also been referred to as ‘2019-nCoV’).\n Phylogenetic analysis of the complete viral genome (29,903 nucleotides) revealed that the virus was most closely related (89.1% nucleotide similarity) to a group of SARS-like

the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatment and clinical outcomes of these patients.\n\n\nMethods\nAll patients with suspected 2019-nCoV were admitted to a designated hospital in Wuhan.\n\n We prospectively collected and analysed data on patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection by real-time RT-PCR and next-generation sequencing.\n\n Data were obtained with standardised data collection forms shared by WHO and the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium from electronic medical records.\n\n Researchers also directly communicated with patients or their families to ascertain epidemiological and symptom data.\n\n Outcomes were also compared between patients who had been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and those who had not.\n\n\nFindings\nBy Jan 2, 2020, 41 admitted hospital patients had been identified as having laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection.\n\n Most of the infected patients were men (30 [73%] of 41); less than half had underlying diseases (13 [32%]), including diabetes (eight [20%]), hypertension (six [15%]), and cardiovascular disease (six [15%]).\n\n Median age was 49·0 years (IQR 41·0–58·0).\n\n 27 (66%) of 41 patients had been exposed to Huanan seafood market.\n\n One family cluster was found.\n\n Common symptoms at onset of illness were fever (40 [98%] of 41 patients), cough (31 [76%]), and myalgia or fatigue (18 [44%]); less common symptoms were sputum production (11 [28%] of 39), headache (three [8%] of 38), haemoptysis (two [5%] of 39), and diarrhoea (one [3%] of 38).\n\n Dyspnoea developed in 22 (55%) of 40 patients (median time from illness onset to dyspnoea 8·0 days [IQR 5·0–13·0]).\n\n 26 (63%) of 41 patients had lymphopenia.\n\n All 41 patients had pneumonia with abnormal findings on chest CT.\n\n Complications included acute respiratory distress syndrome (12 [29%]), RNAaemia (six [15%]), acute cardiac injury (five [12%]) and secondary infection (four [10%]).\n\n 13 (32%) patients were admitted to an ICU and six (15%) died.\n\n Compared with non-ICU patients, ICU patients had higher plasma levels of IL2, IL7, IL10, GSCF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNF?.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe 2019-nCoV infection caused clusters of severe respiratory illness similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and was associated with

implications for virus origins and receptor binding","abstract":"Background\nIn late December, 2019, patients presenting with viral pneumonia due to an unidentified microbial agent were reported in Wuhan, China.\n\n A novel coronavirus was subsequently identified as the causative pathogen, provisionally named 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).\n\n As of Jan 26, 2020, more than 2000 cases of 2019-nCoV infection have been confirmed, most of which involved people living in or visiting Wuhan, and human-to-human transmission has been confirmed.\n\n\nMethods\nWe did next-generation sequencing of samples from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and cultured isolates from nine inpatients, eight of whom had visited the Huanan seafood market in Wuhan.\n\n Complete and partial 2019-nCoV genome sequences were obtained from these individuals.\n\n Viral contigs were connected using Sanger sequencing to obtain the full-length genomes, with the terminal regions determined by rapid amplification of cDNA ends.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these 2019-nCoV genomes and those of other coronaviruses was used to determine the evolutionary history of the virus and help infer its likely origin.\n\n Homology modelling was done to explore the likely receptor-binding properties of the virus.\n\n\nFindings\nThe ten genome sequences of 2019-nCoV obtained from the nine patients were extremely similar, exhibiting more than 99·98% sequence identity.\n\n Notably, 2019-nCoV was closely related (with 88% identity) to two bat-derived severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-like coronaviruses, bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21, collected in 2018 in Zhoushan, eastern China, but were more distant from SARS-CoV (about 79%) and MERS-CoV (about 50%).\n\n Phylogenetic analysis revealed that 2019-nCoV fell within the subgenus Sarbecovirus of the genus Betacoronavirus, with a relatively long branch length to its closest relatives bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21, and was genetically distinct from SARS-CoV.\n\n Notably, homology modelling revealed that 2019-nCoV had a similar receptor-binding domain structure to that of SARS-CoV, despite amino acid variation at some key residues.\n\n\nInterpretation\n2019-nCoV is sufficiently divergent from SARS-CoV to be considered a new human-infecting betacoronavirus.\n\n Although our phylogenetic analysis suggests that bats might be the original host of this virus, an animal sold at the seafood market in Wuhan might represent an intermediate host facilitating the emergence of the virus in humans.\n\n Importantly, structural analysis suggests that 2019-nCoV might be able to bind to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor in humans.\n\n The future evolution, adaptation, and spread of this virus warrant urgent

four endemic human coronaviruses HCoV-229E, -NL63, -OC43, and -HKU1 contribute a considerable share of upper and lower respiratory tract infections in adults and children.\n While their clinical representation resembles that of many other agents of the common cold, their evolutionary histories, and host associations could provide important insights into the natural history of past human pandemics.\n For two of these viruses, we have strong evidence suggesting an origin in major livestock species while primordial associations for all four viruses may have existed with bats and rodents.\n HCoV-NL63 and -229E may originate from bat reservoirs as assumed for many other coronaviruses, but HCoV-OC43 and -HKU1 seem more likely to have speciated from rodent-associated viruses.\n HCoV-OC43 is thought to have emerged from ancestors in domestic animals such as cattle or swine.\n The bovine coronavirus has been suggested to be a possible ancestor, from which HCoV-OC43 may have emerged in the context of a pandemic recorded historically at the end of the 19th century.\n New data suggest that HCoV-229E may actually be transferred from dromedary camels similar to Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus.\n This scenario provides important ecological parallels to the present prepandemic pattern of host associations of the MERS coronavirus.\n","id":"PMC7112090","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Elsevier Inc.","authors":[{"firstname":"Victor

origin and continuing evolution of SARS-CoV-2","abstract":"The SARS-CoV-2 epidemic started in late December 2019 in Wuhan, China, and has since impacted a large portion of China and raised major global concern.\n Herein, we investigated the extent of molecular divergence between SARS-CoV-2 and other related coronaviruses.\n Although we found only 4% variability in genomic nucleotides between SARS-CoV-2 and a bat SARS-related coronavirus (SARSr-CoV; RaTG13), the difference at neutral sites was 17%, suggesting the divergence between the two viruses is much larger than previously estimated.\n Our results suggest that the development of new variations in functional sites in the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike seen in SARS-CoV-2 and viruses from pangolin SARSr-CoVs are likely caused by natural selection besides recombination.\n Population genetic analyses of 103 SARS-CoV-2 genomes indicated that these viruses had two major lineages (designated L and S), that are well defined by two different SNPs that show nearly complete linkage across the viral strains sequenced to date.\n We found that L lineage was more prevalent than the S lineage within the limited patient samples we examined.\n The implication of these evolutionary changes on disease etiology remains unclear.\n These findings strongly underscores the urgent need for further comprehensive studies that combine viral genomic data, with epidemiological studies of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).\n","id":"PMC7107875","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Oxford University

autopsies of three patients who died from SARS in Nan Fang Hospital Guangdong, China were studied retrospectively.\n Routine haematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) staining was used to study all of the tissues from the three cases.\n The lung tissue specimens were studied further with Macchiavello staining, viral inclusion body staining, reticulin staining, PAS staining, immunohistochemistry, ultrathin sectioning and staining, light microscopy, and transmission electron microscopy.\n The first symptom was hyperpyrexia in all three cases, followed by progressive dyspnoea and lung field shadowing.\n The pulmonary lesions included bilateral extensive consolidation, localized haemorrhage and necrosis, desquamative pulmonary alveolitis and bronchitis, proliferation and desquamation of alveolar epithelial cells, exudation of protein and monocytes, lymphocytes and plasma cells in alveoli, hyaline membrane formation, and viral inclusion bodies in alveolar epithelial cells.\n There was also massive necrosis of splenic lymphoid tissue and localized necrosis in lymph nodes.\n Systemic vasculitis included oedema, localized fibrinoid necrosis, and infiltration of monocytes, lymphocytes, and plasma cells into vessel walls in the heart, lung, liver, kidney, adrenal gland, and the stroma of striated muscles.\n Thrombosis was present in small veins.\n Systemic toxic changes included degeneration and necrosis of the parenchyma cells in the lung, liver, kidney, heart, and adrenal gland.\n Electron microscopy demonstrated clusters of viral particles, consistent with coronavirus, in lung tissue.\n SARS is a systemic disease that injures many organs.\n The lungs, immune organs, and systemic small vessels are the main targets of virus attack, so that extensive consolidation of the lung, diffuse alveolar damage with hyaline membrane formation, respiratory distress, and decreased immune function are the main causes of death.\n Copyright © 2003 John Wiley &amp; Sons,

(SARS?CoV) spread rapidly from China throughout the world, causing more than 800 deaths due to the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which is the severe form of acute lung injury (ALI).\n Interestingly, a novel homologue of angiotensin?converting enzyme, termed angiotensin?converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), has been identified as a receptor for SARS?CoV.\n Angiotensin?converting enzyme and ACE2 share homology in their catalytic domain and provide different key functions in the renin–angiotensin system (RAS).\n Angiotensin?converting enzyme cleaves angiotensin I to generate angiotensin II, which is a key effector peptide of the system and exerts multiple biological functions, whereas ACE2 reduces angiotensin II levels.\n Importantly, our recent studies using ACE2 knockout mice have demonstrated that ACE2 protects murine lungs from ARDS.\n Furthermore, SARS?CoV infections and the Spike protein of the SARS?CoV reduce ACE2 expression.\n Notably, injection of SARS?CoV Spike into mice worsens acute lung failure in vivo, which can be attenuated by blocking the renin–angiotensin pathway, suggesting that the activation of the pulmonary RAS influences the pathogenesis of ALI/ARDS and SARS.\n\n","id":"PMC7197898","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Blackwell Publishing

nsp14 exoribonuclease (ExoN) has complicated development of antiviral nucleosides due to its proofreading activity.\n We recently reported that the nucleoside analogue GS-5734 (remdesivir) potently inhibits human and zoonotic CoVs in vitro and in a severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) mouse model.\n However, studies with GS-5734 have not reported resistance associated with GS-5734, nor do we understand the action of GS-5734 in wild-type (WT) proofreading CoVs.\n Here, we show that GS-5734 inhibits murine hepatitis virus (MHV) with similar 50% effective concentration values (EC50) as SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV).\n Passage of WT MHV in the presence of the GS-5734 parent nucleoside selected two mutations in the nsp12 polymerase at residues conserved across all CoVs that conferred up to 5.6-fold resistance to GS-5734, as determined by EC50.\n The resistant viruses were unable to compete with WT in direct coinfection passage in the absence of GS-5734. Introduction of the MHV resistance mutations into SARS-CoV resulted in the same in vitro resistance phenotype and attenuated SARS-CoV pathogenesis in a mouse model.\n Finally, we demonstrate that an MHV mutant lacking ExoN proofreading was significantly more sensitive to GS-5734. Combined, the results indicate that GS-5734 interferes with the nsp12 polymerase even in the setting of intact ExoN proofreading activity and that resistance can be overcome with increased, nontoxic concentrations of GS-5734, further supporting the development of GS-5734 as a broad-spectrum therapeutic to protect against contemporary and emerging

viral respiratory infections and also contain compounds that might directly inhibit 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), an ongoing novel coronavirus that causes pneumonia.\n\n\nMethods\nThere were two main steps in the screening process.\n\n In the first step we conducted a literature search for natural compounds that had been biologically confirmed as against sever acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus or Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus.\n\n Resulting compounds were cross-checked for listing in the Traditional Chinese Medicine Systems Pharmacology Database.\n\n Compounds meeting both requirements were subjected to absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion (ADME) evaluation to verify that oral administration would be effective.\n\n Next, a docking analysis was used to test whether the compound had the potential for direct 2019-nCoV protein interaction.\n\n In the second step we searched Chinese herbal databases to identify plants containing the selected compounds.\n\n Plants containing 2 or more of the compounds identified in our screen were then checked against the catalogue for classic herbal usage.\n\n Finally, network pharmacology analysis was used to predict the general in vivo effects of each selected herb.\n\n\nResults\nOf the natural compounds screened, 13 that exist in traditional Chinese medicines were also found to have potential anti-2019-nCoV activity.\n\n Further, 125 Chinese herbs were found to contain 2 or more of these 13 compounds.\n\n Of these 125 herbs, 26 are classically catalogued as treating viral respiratory infections.\n\n Network pharmacology analysis predicted that the general in vivo roles of these 26 herbal plants were related to regulating viral infection, immune/inflammation reactions and hypoxia response.\n\n\nConclusion\nChinese herbal treatments classically used for treating viral respiratory infection might contain direct anti-2019-nCoV

(HCoVs), the non-severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-like HCoVs (namely HCoV 229E, NL63, OC43, and HKU1), are globally endemic and account for a substantial fraction of upper respiratory tract infections.\n Non-SARS-like CoV can occasionally produce severe diseases in frail subjects but do not cause any major (fatal) epidemics.\n In contrast, SARS like CoVs (namely SARS-CoV and Middle-East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, MERS-CoV) can cause intense short-lived fatal outbreaks.\n The current epidemic caused by the highly contagious SARS-CoV-2 and its rapid spread globally is of major concern.\n There is scanty knowledge on the actual pandemic potential of this new SARS-like virus.\n It might be speculated that SARS-CoV-2 epidemic is grossly underdiagnosed and that the infection is silently spreading across the globe with two consequences: (i) clusters of severe infections among frail subjects could haphazardly occur linked to unrecognized index cases; (ii) the current epidemic could naturally fall into a low-level endemic phase when a significant number of subjects will have developed immunity.\n Understanding the role of paucisymptomatic subjects and stratifying patients according to the risk of developing severe clinical presentations is pivotal for implementing reasonable measures to contain the infection and to reduce its mortality.\n Whilst the future evolution of this epidemic remains unpredictable, classic public health strategies must follow rational patterns.\n The emergence of yet another global epidemic underscores the permanent challenges that infectious

of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).\n\n Epidemiological and clinical characteristics of patients with COVID-19 have been reported but risk factors for mortality and a detailed clinical course of illness, including viral shedding, have not been well described.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this retrospective, multicentre cohort study, we included all adult inpatients (?18 years old) with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 from Jinyintan Hospital and Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital (Wuhan, China) who had been discharged or had died by Jan 31, 2020. Demographic, clinical, treatment, and laboratory data, including serial samples for viral RNA detection, were extracted from electronic medical records and compared between survivors and non-survivors.\n\n We used univariable and multivariable logistic regression methods to explore the risk factors associated with in-hospital death.\n\n\nFindings\n191 patients (135 from Jinyintan Hospital and 56 from Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital) were included in this study, of whom 137 were discharged and 54 died in hospital.\n\n 91 (48%) patients had a comorbidity, with hypertension being the most common (58 [30%] patients), followed by diabetes (36 [19%] patients) and coronary heart disease (15 [8%] patients).\n\n Multivariable regression showed increasing odds of in-hospital death associated with older age (odds ratio 1·10, 95% CI 1·03–1·17, per year increase; p=0·0043), higher Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score (5·65, 2·61–12·23; p&lt;0·0001), and d-dimer greater than 1 ?g/mL (18·42, 2·64–128·55; p=0·0033) on admission.\n\n Median duration of viral shedding was 20·0 days (IQR 17·0–24·0) in survivors, but SARS-CoV-2 was detectable until death in non-survivors.\n\n The longest observed duration of viral shedding in survivors was 37 days.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe potential risk factors of older age, high SOFA score, and d-dimer greater than 1 ?g/mL could help clinicians to identify patients with poor prognosis at an early stage.\n\n Prolonged viral shedding provides the rationale for a strategy of isolation of infected patients and optimal antiviral interventions in the future.\n\n\nFunding\nChinese Academy of Medical Sciences Innovation Fund for Medical Sciences;

meta?analysis","abstract":"Background\nCurrently, the epidemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID?19) has begun to spread worldwide.\n\n We aim to explore reliable evidence for the diagnosis and treatment of the COVID?19 by analyzing all the published studies by Chinese scholars on the clinical and imaging features in novel coronavirus pneumonia caused by SARS?CoV?2.\nMethods\nWe searched five medical databases including two Chinese and three English databases for all published articles on COVID?19 since the outbreak.\n\n A random?effects model was designed, and the imaging and clinical data from all studies were collected for meta?analysis.\n\n\nResults\nOverall, 31 articles and 46?959 patients were included, including 10 English articles and 21 Chinese articles.\n\n The results of meta?analysis showed that the most common clinical manifestations were fever (87.3%; 0.838?0.909), cough (58.1%; 0.502?0.660), dyspnea (38.3%; 0.246?0.520), muscle soreness or fatigue (35.5%; 0.253?0.456), and chest distress (31.2%; ?0.024 to 0.648).\n\n The main imaging findings were bilateral pneumonia (75.7%; 0.639?0.871) and ground?glass opacification (69.9%; 0.602?0.796).\n\n Among the patients, the incidence that required intensive care unit (ICU) was (29.3%; 0.190?0.395), the incidence with acute respiratory distress syndrome was (28.8%; 0.147?0.429), the incidence with multiple organ dysfunction syndrome was (8.5%; ?0.008 to 0.179), and the case fatality rate of patients with COVID?19 was (6.8%; 0.044?0.093).\n\n\nConclusion\nCOVID?19 is a new clinical infectious disease that mainly causes bilateral pneumonia and lung function deteriorates rapidly.\n\n Nearly a third of patients need to be admitted to the ICU, and patients are likely to present respiratory failure or even death.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7228215","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"John Wiley and Sons

January 2020. We analyzed data on the first 425 confirmed cases in Wuhan to determine the epidemiologic characteristics of NCIP.\n\n\nMethods\nWe collected information on demographic characteristics, exposure history, and illness timelines of laboratory-confirmed cases of NCIP that had been reported by January 22, 2020. We described characteristics of the cases and estimated the key epidemiologic time-delay distributions.\n\n In the early period of exponential growth, we estimated the epidemic doubling time and the basic reproductive number.\n\n\nResults\nAmong the first 425 patients with confirmed NCIP, the median age was 59 years and 56% were male.\n\n The majority of cases (55%) with onset before January 1, 2020, were linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, as compared with 8.6% of the subsequent cases.\n\n The mean incubation period was 5.2 days (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.1 to 7.0), with the 95th percentile of the distribution at 12.5 days.\n\n In its early stages, the epidemic doubled in size every 7.4 days.\n\n With a mean serial interval of 7.5 days (95% CI, 5.3 to 19), the basic reproductive number was estimated to be 2.2 (95% CI, 1.4 to 3.9).\n\n\nConclusions\nOn the basis of this information, there is evidence that human-to-human transmission has occurred among close contacts since the middle of December 2019. Considerable efforts to reduce transmission will be required to control outbreaks if similar dynamics apply elsewhere.\n\n Measures to prevent or reduce transmission should be implemented in populations at risk.\n\n (Funded by the Ministry of Science and Technology of China and others.\n\n)\n","id":"PMC7121484","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Massachusetts Medical

SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia in Wuhan, China: a single-centered, retrospective, observational study","abstract":"Background\nAn ongoing outbreak of pneumonia associated with the severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) started in December, 2019, in Wuhan, China.\n\n Information about critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection is scarce.\n\n We aimed to describe the clinical course and outcomes of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this single-centered, retrospective, observational study, we enrolled 52 critically ill adult patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia who were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) of Wuhan Jin Yin-tan hospital (Wuhan, China) between late December, 2019, and Jan 26, 2020. Demographic data, symptoms, laboratory values, comorbidities, treatments, and clinical outcomes were all collected.\n\n Data were compared between survivors and non-survivors.\n\n The primary outcome was 28-day mortality, as of Feb 9, 2020. Secondary outcomes included incidence of SARS-CoV-2-related acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and the proportion of patients requiring mechanical ventilation.\n\n\nFindings\nOf 710 patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, 52 critically ill adult patients were included.\n\n The mean age of the 52 patients was 59·7 (SD 13·3) years, 35 (67%) were men, 21 (40%) had chronic illness, 51 (98%) had fever.\n\n 32 (61·5%) patients had died at 28 days, and the median duration from admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) to death was 7 (IQR 3–11) days for non-survivors.\n\n Compared with survivors, non-survivors were older (64·6 years [11·2] vs 51·9 years [12·9]), more likely to develop ARDS (26 [81%] patients vs 9 [45%] patients), and more likely to receive mechanical ventilation (30 [94%] patients vs 7 [35%] patients), either invasively or non-invasively.\n\n Most patients had organ function damage, including 35 (67%) with ARDS, 15 (29%) with acute kidney injury, 12 (23%) with cardiac injury, 15 (29%) with liver dysfunction, and one (2%) with pneumothorax.\n\n 37 (71%) patients required mechanical ventilation.\n\n Hospital-acquired infection occurred in seven (13·5%) patients.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe mortality of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia is considerable.\n\n The survival time of the non-survivors is likely to be within 1–2 weeks after ICU admission.\n\n Older patients (&gt;65 years) with comorbidities and ARDS are at increased risk of death.\n\n The severity of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia poses great strain on critical care resources in hospitals, especially if they are not adequately staffed or resourced.\n\n\nFunding\nNone.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7102538","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Elsevier

strategies in an outbreak scenario to treat the novel coronavirus originating in Wuhan, China","abstract":"A novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) originating in Wuhan, China presents a potential respiratory viral pandemic to the world population.\n Current efforts are focused on containment and quarantine of infected individuals.\n Ultimately, the outbreak could be controlled with a protective vaccine to prevent 2019-nCoV infection.\n While vaccine research should be pursued intensely, there exists today no therapy to treat 2019-nCoV upon infection, despite an urgent need to find options to help these patients and preclude potential death.\n Herein, I review the potential options to treat 2019-nCoV in patients, with an emphasis on the necessity for speed and timeliness in developing new and effective therapies in this outbreak.\n I consider the options of drug repurposing, developing neutralizing monoclonal antibody therapy, and an oligonucleotide strategy targeting the viral RNA genome, emphasizing the promise and pitfalls of these approaches.\n Finally, I advocate for the fastest strategy to develop a treatment now, which could be resistant to any mutations the virus may have in the future.\n The proposal is a biologic that blocks 2019-nCoV entry using a soluble version of the viral receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), fused to an immunoglobulin Fc domain (ACE2-Fc), providing a neutralizing antibody with maximal breath to avoid any viral escape, while also helping to recruit the immune system to build lasting immunity.\n The ACE2-Fc therapy would also supplement decreased ACE2 levels in the lungs during infection, thereby directly treating acute respiratory distress pathophysiology as a third mechanism of action.\n The sequence of the ACE2-Fc protein is provided to investigators, allowing its possible use in recombinant protein expression systems to start producing drug today to treat patients under compassionate use, while formal clinical trials are later undertaken.\n Such a treatment could help infected patients before a protective vaccine is developed and widely available in the coming months to year(s).\n","id":"PMC7029759","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"F1000 Research Limited","authors":[{"firstname":"Robert

Course of Lung Changes On Chest CT During Recovery From 2019 Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) Pneumonia","abstract":"Background\nChest CT is used to assess the severity of lung involvement in COVID-19 pneumonia.\n\n\nPurpose\nTo determine the change in chest CT findings associated with COVID-19 pneumonia from initial diagnosis until patient recovery.\n\n\nMaterials and Methods\nThis retrospective review included patients with RT-PCR confirmed COVID-19 infection presenting between 12 January 2020 to 6 February 2020. Patients with severe respiratory distress and/ or oxygen requirement at any time during the disease course were excluded.\n\n Repeat Chest CT was obtained at approximately 4 day intervals.\n\n The total CT score was the sum of lung involvement (5 lobes, score 1-5 for each lobe, range, 0 none, 25 maximum) was determined.\n\n\nResults\nTwenty one patients (6 males and 15 females, age 25-63 years) with confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia were evaluated.\n\n These patients under went a total of 82 pulmonary CT scans with a mean interval of 4±1 days (range: 1-8 days).\n\n All patients were discharged after a mean hospitalized period of 17±4 days (range: 11-26 days).\n\n Maximum lung involved peaked at approximately 10 days (with the calculated total CT score of 6) from the onset of initial symptoms (R2=0.25), p&lt;0.001).\n\n Based on quartiles of patients from day 0 to day 26 involvement, 4 stages of lung CT were defined: Stage 1 (0-4 days): ground glass opacities (GGO) in 18/24 (75%) patients with the total CT score of 2±2; (2)Stage-2 (5-8d days): increased crazy-paving pattern 9/17 patients (53%) with a increase in total CT score (6±4, p=0.002); (3) Stage-3 (9-13days): consolidation 19/21 (91%) patients with the peak of total CT score (7±4); (4) Stage-4 (?14 days): gradual resolution of consolidation 15/20 (75%) patients with a decreased total CT score (6±4) without crazy-paving pattern.\n\n\nConclusion\nIn patients recovering from COVID-19 pneumonia (without severe respiratory distress during the disease course), lung abnormalities on chest CT showed greatest severity approximately 10 days after initial onset of symptoms.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7233367","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Radiological Society of North

inflammatory markers, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein and fetuin-A pre- and post-levothyroxine treatment in cases of subclinical hypothyroidism.\n\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS:\nA total of 32 patients with a diagnosis of subclinical hypothyroidism and a control group of 30 healthy individuals were tested for high-sensitivity C-reactive protein and fetuin-A, followed by the administration of 50 µg of levothyroxine in the patient group for 3 months.\n\n During the post-treatment stage, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein and fetuin-A levels in the patient group were re-assessed and compared with pre-treatment values.\n\n\nRESULTS:\nPre-treatment levels of both high-sensitivity C-reactive protein and fetuin-A were observed to be higher in the patient group than in the control group.\n\n The decrease in high-sensitivity C-reactive protein levels during the post-treatment stage was not statistically significant.\n\n However, the decrease observed in post-treatment fetuin-A levels was found to be statistically significant.\n\n\nCONCLUSION:\nThe decrease in fetuin-A levels in subclinical hypothyroidism cases indicates that levothyroxine treatment exerts anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic effects.\n\n Although the decrease in high-sensitivity C-reactive protein levels was statistically non-significant, it is predicted to reach significance with sustained treatment.\n\n\n","id":"PMC4351305","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Hospital das Clínicas da Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de São
