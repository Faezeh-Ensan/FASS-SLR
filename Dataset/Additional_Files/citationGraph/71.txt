This pandemic has resulted in a worldwide crisis with unprecedented decisions of restrictive non-pharmacological mitigation interventions taken at local, regional, or national levels. A major aim of these measures is lessening as much as possible the daily number of new individuals requiring an admission in intensive care units (ICU) in order to be able to appropriately manage them in the healthcare system and sustain an appropriate management for the rest of the population. A fast inflow of new admissions in the ICU has critical consequences within a short time. For example, between March 19 and April 2 2020 in France, the number of ICU beds occupied by COVID-19 infected persons dramatically increased from 1002 to 6305, corresponding to an average daily increase of 14% additional beds. Such a situation requires a massive and rapid increase of ICU facilities and the French Minister of Health announced on March 28 that the nationwide capacity had been increased from 5000 to 10,000 critical beds. The underlying mathematics are simple: an average unbalanced increase of 15% during 14 days implies that at day 14, the resulting occupancy would be that of day 0 multiplied by a factor 7.08 since 1.15(14 days) = 7.08. The system is highly sensitive to a sustained unbalance: even an average increase as low as 2% during 2 weeks, a likely situation after outbreak peak, would nevertheless require increasing occupancy at day 14 by 32%.\nThe average length of stay (ALOS) in ICU is an important estimate relating to the stability of the healthcare system in terms of ICU bed occupancy. For instance, hypothesizing an ICU ALOS of 10 days in patients infected with a new emerging agent, the daily probability of a bed discharge would be 1/ALOS = 1/10 = 0.10. This implies that whenever the rate of required admissions would exceed the 10% ALOS-dependent threshold, the global number of beds occupied or required would increase and possibly overwhelm capacity.\nThis example demonstrates that estimating the ICU ALOS of a population infected by an emergent virus constitutes a very critical information to modelers and decision-makers for guiding adaptations of the local capacities in the context of the outbreak. Such an estimate is expected to be provided as soon as possible. However, when examining the situation within a short delay after the beginning of the outbreak, only few cases are likely to be already discharged from the ICU. The patients still in ICU referred to as censored cases must be considered in any unbiased estimation relating to the length of stay (LOS). In this study, we present a detailed examination of the timeline of the whole cohort of consecutive COVID-19 patients admitted to a devoted ICU of the Zhongnan hospital of Wuhan University (ZHWU) in which we investigated the evolution of the ALOS estimation according to the accumulation of the cases, using two methods of estimation. Our results indicate that even considering a last follow-up date corresponding to the date when two-thirds of the admitted patients would have been discharged, the ICU ALOS estimated with the biased method would be nearly half of that issued from the unbiased method. In the light of these investigations, the estimates relating to ICU LOS of COVID-19 cases that have been reported to date, likely underestimate the real values. Such estimates being also used in forecasting models, the present study has practical implications for improving prediction scenarios to guide public decision.\nMethods\nEthics\nThis study was approved by the Medical Ethics Committee, ZHWU (Clinical Ethical Approval No. 2020005). The informed consent was waived by the Medical Ethics Committee for emerging infectious disease.\nSetting\nAs in many locations, the organization of the ZHWU (Hubei province, People's Republic of China) for managing COVID-19 patients was subjected to several changes during the course of the COVID-19 outbreak. First, on December 30 2019, at a time when the outbreak emerged frankly, two initial ICU, one depending on emergency and the other from surgery, were reorganized for constituting a single entity of 31 beds devoted to the management of patients with COVID-19 requiring critical care. Second, on March 12 2020, at a time when the outbreak had declined, all COVID-19 ICU patients were transferred to another ICU in Leishenshan hospital, the largest newly built facility for COVID-19 patients with 1600 beds, while ICU admissions were reorganized for other pathologies than COVID-19 at ZHWU. Third, on April 15, Leishenshan hospital was definitively closed and patients initially admitted at ZHWU were retransferred to this hospital.\nPatients\nAll consecutive patients with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 by PCR and initially admitted to the above-mentioned ICU of 31 beds at ZHWU from December 30 2019 to March 12 2020 (n = 57) were included in the study. Patients admitted to this ICU during this period also included 10 consecutive patients for which there was a radiological evidence of viral pneumonia while RT-PCR test of throat swabs had remained negative for several times, and these patients were also considered as eligible for the study. Last follow-up of patients was made on April 8 2020, 91 and 34 days after the first and the last admission, respectively. The file of each patient along his/her hospital course was cautiously reviewed, including whenever the patient was transferred to another hospital. The following data were collected for each patient: age, sex, date of admission and discharge in the hospital as well as the vital status at discharge (dead or alive), date of admission and discharge in the ICU as well as the vital status at discharge (dead or alive), beginning and end dates of mechanical invasive or noninvasive ventilation procedures. Whenever a patient was transferred from the ICU in a given hospital to the ICU of another hospital, we considered that such a continuum constituted a single ICU stay.\nSince the objective of this study was an assessment of the ALOS in ICU of COVID-19 patients, 8 of the above-mentioned 67 stays were excluded from the analysis: first, one of the 57 patients with a confirmed RT-PCR positive test had contracted COVID-19 at the hospital while this patient was hospitalized for post-complications after a kidney transplantation, and the record file highly suggested an ICU stay relating more to these complications than to COVID-19 infection. Conversely, only three of the ten patients with the radiological evidence of viral pneumonia were included in the analysis: seven patients had clinical characteristics suggesting that the ICU stay might be not mainly related to COVID-19 (e.g., liver lesions, massive cerebral infarction, ...), and were therefore excluded from the study.\nStatistical analyses\nData are expressed as mean (95% confidence interval (CI)) or median [interquartile range (IQR)], and represented according to the Kaplan-Meier estimator. In addition, we examined how the ICU ALOS estimates of COVID-19 patients issued from two estimation methods evolve and compare while the cumulative number of available stays increases along the course of the outbreak. All analyses were made with R statistical software version 3.6.1 and censored data were fitted with the use of the flexsurv package. The two methods compared were the following.\nDischarged patients' estimation (DPE)\nThis first method applies a straight-forward calculation: all ICU stays of the series for which the discharge date is before or equal to a given follow-up date of interest were considered (and only such stays were considered). Reported ALOS estimate was the mean LOS of those already discharged patients. Reported LOS median and quartiles were calculated on the same patients.\nCensored patients' estimation (CPE)\nThis second method takes into account the inherent censored characteristic of longitudinal data: considering a given follow-up date of estimation, all previously admitted patients were considered, whether or not they were already discharged. A parametric distribution (e.g., exponential, gamma or Weibull) was fitted to the whole set of patients. Such a method for appropriately analyzing time-to-event censored data belongs to the standard framework of methods of survival analysis. Reported ALOS estimates, as well as LOS medians and quartiles, are predictions based on this parametric model.\nAdditional comparisons\nIn order to demonstrate the generalizability of our results, these two methods were also compared using two simulation studies. Both considered a 30-bed ICU with as many patients admitted on day 0 and new patients admitted as soon as the previous ones were discharged. In the first study, simulated LOS were sampled with replacement from the 59 observed LOS in ZHWU. Such a simulation allows to be free from the observed schedule in practice, including the order of occurrence of the lengths of stay observed. The simulation forces the ICU to be initiated in an already saturated functioning admitting COVID-19 patients. The LOS of the patient still in the ICU at the date of last follow-up was imputed. In the second study, LOS were sampled from a parametric gamma distribution in order to explore how estimates evolve with time in a situation where the true distribution is known.\nResults\nTimeline of the 59 COVID-19 cases treated in the intensive care unit (ICU). a For each case are plotted admission and discharge dates, periods of ventilation, and vital status at discharge. b Cumulative numbers of admissions and discharges according to time, with discharged patients' lengths of stay (LOS). c Evolution of the estimates of ICU average LOS issued from the two methods of estimation according to the date chosen for estimation. The expected estimate is shown together with the corresponding 95% confidence interval. CPE, method including censored cases; DPE, method considering only stays for which the patient was already discharged from ICU at the date of estimation. Whenever some patients of the cohort remain treated in the ICU at the date of follow-up, c indicates that DPE yields a biased underestimation of ALOS: discharges observed early are more likely to concern patients with a short LOS or conversely, the discharges occurring at the end of the process are more likely to concern patients with a long LOS. b illustrates the latter pattern: nine out of the 10 first occurring discharges concern LOS &lt; 15 days, while eight out of the 10 last occurring discharges concerned LOS &gt; 30 days\nThe median age of the patients was 62 years [IQR 52-70] and 38 (64%) were men. The time-course of the ICU stays of the 59 COVID-19 patients is shown in Fig. 1a. At the date of last follow-up, April 16, one patient was still in the ICU, 21 deaths (36%) had occurred in the ICU, and the 37 patients discharged alive from the ICU were also all discharged alive from the hospital.\nInvasive mechanical ventilation procedures concerned 40 (68%) patients: stays involving only noninvasive ventilation concerned 11 patients, stays involving only mechanical invasive ventilation concerned 12 patients, and 17 patients had shifted from one type of ventilation to another during the course of their stay. The mean and median estimates for the duration of mechanical invasive ventilation was 21.6 days (95% CI 15.4-28.7) and 12.0 days [IQR 8.5-31 days], respectively. The corresponding estimates for noninvasive ventilation were 5.6 days (95% CI 3.9-7.8) and 3.5 [IQR 1.9-3.0], respectively.\nFigure 1b shows the cumulative number of admissions and discharges according to time. At the date of last follow-up, over 3 months (99 days) had passed since the date of the first admission, January 8. Figure 1c shows the evolution of DPE and CPE-based ALOS estimates according to the accumulating data that become available as time passes. Exponential, Weibull, and gamma distributions led to similar fits of the data:with a delayed convergence for the exponential distribution:and we retained the gamma distribution for reporting CPE. On February 8, 1 month after the first admission date, 11 (19%) patients had been discharged from the ICU and the corresponding estimate of ALOS with DPE was 18.0 days (95% CI 12.2-27.0), nearly twice that of DPE which was 10.0 days (95% CI 6.9-13.1). On March 8, 2 months after the first admission date, 38 (64%) patients had been discharged and the estimate of ALOS issued from DPE and CPE at that date was 13.0 days (95% CI 10.4-15.6) and 23.1 days (95% CI 18.1-29.7), respectively. Under the assumption that the parametric distribution used in CPE is well fitted to the data, the two methods should converge towards a similar estimate when no censoring data remain, i.e., when all patients of the cohort have been discharged: while only one patient remained in the ICU at the last date of follow-up, April 16, ALOS with CPE and DPE was 21.1 days (95% CI 17.5-25.3) (which constitutes the most accurate estimate on the study data set) and 20.2 days (95% CI 16.2-24.3), respectively. CPE estimate of hospital ALOS was 30.6 days (95% CI 26.2-35.3) and median duration of hospital LOS was 27.0 days [IQR 16.5-39.0]. Whenever some patients of the cohort remain treated in the ICU at the date of follow-up, DPE yields a biased underestimation of ALOS: discharges observed early are more likely to concern patients with a short LOS or conversely, the discharges occurring at the end of the process are more likely to concern patients with a long LOS. Figure 1b, in which the LOS corresponding to each discharged patient is indicated along the discharge curve, illustrates this pattern: 9 out of the 10 first occurring discharges concern LOS &lt; 15 days, while eight out of the 10 last occurring discharges concerned LOS &gt; 30 days. In the end, the simulations shown in Additional file 1: Appendix S1 demonstrate the generalizability of the biased pattern of DPE, and the unbiased pattern of CPE.\nDischarge data according to time since intensive care unit (ICU) admission. a Kaplan-Meier representation of the probability of discharge according to ICU length of stay (LOS). b Distribution of the observed ICU LOS\nFigure 2a presents a Kaplan-Meier estimator and indicates that the median ICU LOS is around 16 days. The corresponding estimate issued from CPE is slightly higher, at 17.4 days, because the corresponding parametric fit is impacted by the substantial frequency of very long stays: Fig. 2b shows the LOS distribution and 14 out of the 59 patients (24%) had a length of stay &gt;= 30 days. The relatively high frequency of such patients with a very long LOS explains why the expected estimates of ALOS shown in Fig. 1c requires a substantial delay until remaining stable. Interestingly, among the 14 patients with a LOS &gt;= 30 days, 8 had died while the total number of observed deaths in the cohort was 21. The fact that 38% (8/21) of the deaths observed occurred in patients who had an ICU stay &gt;= 30 days also indicates that obtaining a reliable estimate of the mortality rate in the patients admitted to the ICU as well as obtaining a reliable ALOS of the individuals dying in the ICU also requires waiting a substantial delay after the beginning of the outbreak.\nDiscussion\nLOS estimates reported in the literature\nReference, journal, date of line publication	Summary of important elements relating to the estimate provided	Estimate provided (ALOS, average length of stay; MLOS, median length of stay; IQR, interquartile range)	 	Wang et al., Jama, Feb 7 2020 	Monocentre study (Wuhan, China). 138 consecutive patients admitted in the hospital from Jan 1 to Jan 28 2020.

The study also recalls that appropriate methods of estimation require the inclusion of censored cases in the analysis, and we also demonstrate the important bias associated with calculations only based on the stays of already discharged patients. Importantly, the bias inherent of the latter method is not at all sensitive to sample size or to the consideration of factors potentially associated with ICU ALOS value (e.g., variability from one center to another). For example, whatever the number of patients and the variability of the numerous centers involved in the studies of Guan et al. based on National data from China and in the study of Grasselli et al. based on 72 hospitals from Lombardy mentioned in Table 1, the provided estimates were biased. Finally, whenever patients of the population treated in the ICU with a long LOS are observed at a substantial frequency, as was observed in the present reported series, the bias relating to inappropriate methods might be especially important.\nAlthough the present study shows that ALOS constitutes an important parameter, we failed to find any observational study of COVID-19 cases published in the early phase of the epidemic that reported ALOS. Nevertheless, several of these studies had reported median estimates of ICU LOS and such a choice is perfectly understandable: since ICU LOS is not normally distributed, a reporting of median and IQR instead of the mean is recommended. The medians of ICU LOS reported (see Table 1) often concern a particular sub-population (e.g., patients who died, patients who survived), ranged from 4 days (estimate considering six patients who died in the ICU) to 11 days (estimate reported in the same study and based on 12 patients discharged alive from the ICU), and raise concerns in terms of the potential bias of the reported estimates (see Table 1). These concerns may be then extended to modeling studies that will naturally parameterize their forecasts according to the observational data reported (Table 1). The data of the series reported here yielded an estimate of ICU ALOS at 21.1 days (95% CI 17.5-25.3) and a median ICU LOS at 17.4 days [IQR 9.6-28.7]. These estimates are well above estimates that were reported in the early phase of the epidemic. They are associated with several strengths. First the whole study time-course lasted 99 days, enough time had passed for allowing a last date of follow-up at which all patients but one were discharged. To our knowledge, such a resulting quasi-complete distribution of the LOS observed in a given series of COVID-19 cases (see Fig. 2b) has not been reported to date, and in addition, such a data set is indeed appropriate for assessing estimation methods since the target value of the estimate is nearly perfectly known (only one stay remained censored). Second, the high values reported here are based on a reasonable sample size (n = 59) and our study demonstrates that an unbiased estimate at a reasonable distance from the beginning of the epidemic is inherently higher than that issued from a biased calculation a short time after the beginning of the outbreak. Nevertheless, our study also has some limitations. The study is monocentric and therefore, the extrapolation of our estimates to other settings is questionable. The gamma distribution-based CPE method allowed a reasonable ALOS estimate at the beginning of the epidemic, but other distributions might better fit data from other settings. Because it is unbiased, the CPE method should nevertheless always be preferred, and the choice of associated simple parametric distributions should be favored as compared to more complex distributions whenever corresponding fittings are similar. The estimate issued from Wuhan data is also inherently adjusted for many co-factors with a likely influence on ICU LOS that may vary from one place to another and/or with time. For example, one may think about the impact of disease knowledge on triage decisions and on the decision to withdraw early mechanical ventilation based on refinement of prognostic factors (ethical issues), bed availability and pressure of this threatening epidemic on the organization of the healthcare system likely modifies the characteristics of admitted patients as well as various specific characteristics of the units (including cultural behaviors), accumulating experience with COVID-19 patients likely improves management procedures according to time. Ideally, estimates for different spatiotemporal settings should be based on observational data directly collected in corresponding settings for guarantying estimates appropriately adjusted with co-factors. However, such generalizability issues relating to estimate variability according to spatiotemporal conditions also stands for most studies reported to date, and devising a universal validated model able to adjust for any spatiotemporal condition worldwide is a very ambitious work, far beyond the object of the present study. The main outcome of this study is alerting the community about three elements. First, all scientists working on COVID-19 must realize that when dealing with data relating to LOS, they should imperatively use appropriate methods devoted to the analysis of censored data. Such methods are not original, they belong to the standard tools used in the domain of survival analysis and are easily available in any statistical software. There is no reason for avoiding their usage, and the reader will find an illustrative computer code in Additional file 2: Appendix S2. An additional strength of these methods:illustrated in Additional file 2: Appendix S2:is their ability to fit individual characteristics of patients with multivariable models to predict LOS adjusted to co-factors explicitly considered in the model formula. Such a modeling strategy may for example be deployed for documenting variations between different recruitment settings or for providing estimates in specific strata of the population. A side result of the analyses made in the present study suggests that the fatality rate of COVID-19 patients in the ICU might also be underestimated, and on this topic, the present study shares many perspectives with the work of Lipsitch et al. on the biases associated with the estimation of case-fatality risks. Second, in the context of the first outbreak of a novel infectious agent, some estimates concerning time-to-event data such as hospital LOS, ICU LOS, duration of ventilation, time of illness onset to ICU admission, etc., constitute a kind of critical food required to feed forecast models and these models are very important in many issues such as exploring and comparing mitigation scenarios, or optimizing preparedness. Therefore, enhancing the quality of the above-mentioned estimates is an important concern and our study suggests that there is room for such enhancements in the analyses of COVID-19 epidemic. Third and to conclude, whenever the estimates reported in this study would be generalizable to other settings, then this is bad news: long ICU LOS as reported here imply that occupied beds remain unavailable for a long time and this adds additional pressure to the surge in ICU beds encountered in many places worldwide.\nConclusion\nBased on this complete series of consecutive cases together with simulated cases, the present work demonstrates that ICU_ALOS estimates used in most models to date may be importantly underestimated. In such a context of novel infectious agent, this work advocates for an urgent application of widespread survival analysis tools to properly estimate ICU_ALOS and other critical parameters relying on censored time-to-event data. Accurate estimation of these parameters, on which rely forecast models, is crucial to ensure consistency of mitigation and preparedness scenarios, as attested by the worldwide concern over ICU bed occupancy in the current COVID-19 crisis.\nSupplementary information\nPublisher's Note\nSpringer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.\nSupplementary information\nSupplementary information accompanies this paper at 10.1186/s13613-020-00749-6.\nAuthors' contributions\nThe decision of performing the study emerged from informal discussions involving NL, XZ, FC, BR, YZ, and GH.

Demographic data, symptoms, laboratory values, comorbidities, treatments, and clinical outcomes were all collected.\n\n Data were compared between survivors and non-survivors.\n\n The primary outcome was 28-day mortality, as of Feb 9, 2020. Secondary outcomes included incidence of SARS-CoV-2-related acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and the proportion of patients requiring mechanical ventilation.\n\n\nFindings\nOf 710 patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, 52 critically ill adult patients were included.\n\n The mean age of the 52 patients was 59·7 (SD 13·3) years, 35 (67%) were men, 21 (40%) had chronic illness, 51 (98%) had fever.\n\n 32 (61·5%) patients had died at 28 days, and the median duration from admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) to death was 7 (IQR 3–11) days for non-survivors.\n\n Compared with survivors, non-survivors were older (64·6 years [11·2] vs 51·9 years [12·9]), more likely to develop ARDS (26 [81%] patients vs 9 [45%] patients), and more likely to receive mechanical ventilation (30 [94%] patients vs 7 [35%] patients), either invasively or non-invasively.\n\n Most patients had organ function damage, including 35 (67%) with ARDS, 15 (29%) with acute kidney injury, 12 (23%) with cardiac injury, 15 (29%) with liver dysfunction, and one (2%) with pneumothorax.\n\n 37 (71%) patients required mechanical ventilation.\n\n Hospital-acquired infection occurred in seven (13·5%) patients.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe mortality of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia is considerable.\n\n The survival time of the non-survivors is likely to be within 1–2 weeks after ICU admission.\n\n Older patients (&gt;65 years) with comorbidities and ARDS are at increased risk of death.\n\n The severity of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia poses great strain on critical care resources in hospitals, especially if they are not adequately staffed or resourced.\n\n\nFunding\nNone.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7102538","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Elsevier

reported but risk factors for mortality and a detailed clinical course of illness, including viral shedding, have not been well described.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this retrospective, multicentre cohort study, we included all adult inpatients (?18 years old) with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 from Jinyintan Hospital and Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital (Wuhan, China) who had been discharged or had died by Jan 31, 2020. Demographic, clinical, treatment, and laboratory data, including serial samples for viral RNA detection, were extracted from electronic medical records and compared between survivors and non-survivors.\n\n We used univariable and multivariable logistic regression methods to explore the risk factors associated with in-hospital death.\n\n\nFindings\n191 patients (135 from Jinyintan Hospital and 56 from Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital) were included in this study, of whom 137 were discharged and 54 died in hospital.\n\n 91 (48%) patients had a comorbidity, with hypertension being the most common (58 [30%] patients), followed by diabetes (36 [19%] patients) and coronary heart disease (15 [8%] patients).\n\n Multivariable regression showed increasing odds of in-hospital death associated with older age (odds ratio 1·10, 95% CI 1·03–1·17, per year increase; p=0·0043), higher Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score (5·65, 2·61–12·23; p&lt;0·0001), and d-dimer greater than 1 ?g/mL (18·42, 2·64–128·55; p=0·0033) on admission.\n\n Median duration of viral shedding was 20·0 days (IQR 17·0–24·0) in survivors, but SARS-CoV-2 was detectable until death in non-survivors.\n\n The longest observed duration of viral shedding in survivors was 37 days.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe potential risk factors of older age, high SOFA score, and d-dimer greater than 1 ?g/mL could help clinicians to identify patients with poor prognosis at an early stage.\n\n Prolonged viral shedding provides the rationale for a strategy of isolation of infected patients and optimal antiviral interventions in the future.\n\n\nFunding\nChinese Academy of Medical Sciences Innovation Fund for Medical Sciences; National Science Grant for Distinguished Young Scholars; National Key Research and Development Program of China; The Beijing Science and Technology Project; and Major Projects of National Science and Technology on New Drug Creation and Development.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7270627","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Elsevier Ltd.","authors":[{"firstname":"Fei","surname":"Zhou","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ting","surname":"Yu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ronghui","surname":"Du","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Guohui","surname":"Fan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ying","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhibo","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jie","surname":"Xiang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yeming","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Bin","surname":"Song","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xiaoying","surname":"Gu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lulu","surname":"Guan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yuan","surname":"Wei","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Hui","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xudong","surname":"Wu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jiuyang","surname":"Xu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Shengjin","surname":"Tu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yi","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Hua","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Bin","surname":"Cao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}],"References depth 2":[{"doi":"10.1001/jama.2020.1097","date":"1970-01-01","title":"The novel coronavirus originating in Wuhan, China: challenges for global health governance","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1101/2020.02.07.937862","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus: the species and its viruses:a statement of the Coronavirus Study Group","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Short term outcome and risk factors for adverse clinical outcomes in adults with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1056/NEJMoa2001316","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Early Transmission Dynamics in Wuhan, China, of Novel Coronavirus–Infected Pneumonia","abstract":"Background\nThe initial cases of novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV)–infected pneumonia (NCIP) occurred in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, in December 2019 and January 2020. We analyzed data on the first 425 confirmed cases in Wuhan to determine the epidemiologic characteristics of NCIP.\n\n\nMethods\nWe collected information on demographic characteristics, exposure history, and illness timelines of laboratory-confirmed cases of NCIP that had been reported by January 22, 2020. We described characteristics of the cases and estimated the key epidemiologic time-delay distributions.\n\n In the early period of exponential growth, we estimated the epidemic doubling time and the basic reproductive number.\n\n\nResults\nAmong the first 425 patients with confirmed NCIP, the median age was 59 years and 56% were male.\n\n The majority of cases (55%) with onset before January 1, 2020, were linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, as compared with 8.6% of the subsequent cases.\n\n The mean incubation period was 5.2 days (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.1 to 7.0), with the 95th percentile of the distribution at 12.5 days.\n\n In its early stages, the epidemic doubled in size every 7.4 days.\n\n With a mean serial interval of 7.5 days (95% CI, 5.3 to 19), the basic reproductive number was estimated to be 2.2 (95% CI, 1.4 to 3.9).\n\n\nConclusions\nOn the basis of this information, there is evidence that human-to-human transmission has occurred among close contacts since the middle of December 2019. Considerable efforts to reduce transmission will be required to control outbreaks if similar dynamics apply elsewhere.\n\n Measures to prevent or reduce transmission should be implemented in populations at risk.\n\n (Funded by the Ministry of Science and Technology of China and others.\n\n)\n","id":"PMC7121484","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Massachusetts Medical

SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia in Wuhan, China: a single-centered, retrospective, observational study","abstract":"Background\nAn ongoing outbreak of pneumonia associated with the severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) started in December, 2019, in Wuhan, China.\n\n Information about critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection is scarce.\n\n We aimed to describe the clinical course and outcomes of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this single-centered, retrospective, observational study, we enrolled 52 critically ill adult patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia who were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) of Wuhan Jin Yin-tan hospital (Wuhan, China) between late December, 2019, and Jan 26, 2020. Demographic data, symptoms, laboratory values, comorbidities, treatments, and clinical outcomes were all collected.\n\n Data were compared between survivors and non-survivors.\n\n The primary outcome was 28-day mortality, as of Feb 9, 2020. Secondary outcomes included incidence of SARS-CoV-2-related acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and the proportion of patients requiring mechanical ventilation.\n\n\nFindings\nOf 710 patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, 52 critically ill adult patients were included.\n\n The mean age of the 52 patients was 59·7 (SD 13·3) years, 35 (67%) were men, 21 (40%) had chronic illness, 51 (98%) had fever.\n\n 32 (61·5%) patients had died at 28 days, and the median duration from admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) to death was 7 (IQR 3–11) days for non-survivors.\n\n Compared with survivors, non-survivors were older (64·6 years [11·2] vs 51·9 years [12·9]), more likely to develop ARDS (26 [81%] patients vs 9 [45%] patients), and more likely to receive mechanical ventilation (30 [94%] patients vs 7 [35%] patients), either invasively or non-invasively.\n\n Most patients had organ function damage, including 35 (67%) with ARDS, 15 (29%) with acute kidney injury, 12 (23%) with cardiac injury, 15 (29%) with liver dysfunction, and one (2%) with pneumothorax.\n\n 37 (71%) patients required mechanical ventilation.\n\n Hospital-acquired infection occurred in seven (13·5%) patients.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe mortality of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia is considerable.\n\n The survival time of the non-survivors is likely to be within 1–2 weeks after ICU admission.\n\n Older patients (&gt;65 years) with comorbidities and ARDS are at increased risk of death.\n\n The severity of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia poses great strain on critical care resources in hospitals, especially if they are not adequately staffed or resourced.\n\n\nFunding\nNone.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7102538","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Elsevier

Considerable efforts to reduce transmission will be required to control outbreaks if similar dynamics apply elsewhere.\n\n Measures to prevent or reduce transmission should be implemented in populations at risk.\n\n (Funded by the Ministry of Science and Technology of China and others.\n\n)\n","id":"PMC7121484","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Massachusetts Medical Society","authors":[{"firstname":"Qun","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xuhua","surname":"Guan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Peng","surname":"Wu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xiaoye","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lei","surname":"Zhou","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yeqing","surname":"Tong","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ruiqi","surname":"Ren","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Kathy S.M.","surname":"Leung","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Eric H.Y.","surname":"Lau","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jessica Y.","surname":"Wong","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xuesen","surname":"Xing","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Nijuan","surname":"Xiang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yang","surname":"Wu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Chao","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Qi","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Dan","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Tian","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jing","surname":"Zhao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Man","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Wenxiao","surname":"Tu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Chuding","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lianmei","surname":"Jin","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Rui","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Qi","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Suhua","surname":"Zhou","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Rui","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Hui","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yinbo","surname":"Luo","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yuan","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ge","surname":"Shao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Huan","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhongfa","surname":"Tao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yang","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhiqiang","surname":"Deng","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Boxi","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhitao","surname":"Ma","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yanping","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Guoqing","surname":"Shi","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Tommy T.Y.","surname":"Lam","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Joseph T.","surname":"Wu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"George F.","surname":"Gao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Benjamin J.","surname":"Cowling","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Bo","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Bo","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Gabriel M.","surname":"Leung","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zijian","surname":"Feng","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1126/science.abb3221","date":"2020-03-12","title":"Substantial undocumented infection facilitates the rapid dissemination of novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2)","abstract":"The virus causing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has now become pandemic.\n How has it managed to spread from China to all around the world within 3 to 4 months?

characteristics of the affected patients.\n\n\nMethods\nWe extracted data regarding 1099 patients with laboratory-confirmed Covid-19 from 552 hospitals in 30 provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities in mainland China through January 29, 2020. The primary composite end point was admission to an intensive care unit (ICU), the use of mechanical ventilation, or death.\n\n\nResults\nThe median age of the patients was 47 years; 41.9% of the patients were female.\n\n The primary composite end point occurred in 67 patients (6.1%), including 5.0% who were admitted to the ICU, 2.3% who underwent invasive mechanical ventilation, and 1.4% who died.\n\n Only 1.9% of the patients had a history of direct contact with wildlife.\n\n Among nonresidents of Wuhan, 72.3% had contact with residents of Wuhan, including 31.3% who had visited the city.\n\n The most common symptoms were fever (43.8% on admission and 88.7% during hospitalization) and cough (67.8%).\n\n Diarrhea was uncommon (3.8%).\n\n The median incubation period was 4 days (interquartile range, 2 to 7).\n\n On admission, ground-glass opacity was the most common radiologic finding on chest computed tomography (CT) (56.4%).\n\n No radiographic or CT abnormality was found

case-fatality risk (CFR)—the probability that a person dies from an infection given that they are a case—is a high priority in epidemiologic investigation of newly emerging infectious diseases and sometimes in new outbreaks of known infectious diseases.\n The data available to estimate the overall CFR are often gathered for other purposes (e.\ng.\n, surveillance) in challenging circumstances.\n We describe two forms of bias that may affect the estimation of the overall CFR—preferential ascertainment of severe cases and bias from reporting delays—and review solutions that have been proposed and implemented in past epidemics.\n Also of interest is the estimation of the causal impact of specific interventions (e.\ng.\n, hospitalization, or hospitalization at a particular hospital) on survival, which can be estimated as a relative CFR for two or more groups.\n When observational data are used for this purpose, three more sources of bias may arise: confounding, survivorship bias, and selection due to preferential inclusion in surveillance datasets of those who are hospitalized and/or die.\n We illustrate these biases and caution against causal interpretation of differential CFR among those receiving different interventions in observational datasets.\n Again, we discuss ways to reduce these biases, particularly by estimating outcomes in smaller but more systematically defined cohorts ascertained before the onset of symptoms, such as those identified by forward contact tracing.\n Finally, we discuss the circumstances in which these biases may affect non-causal interpretation of risk factors for death among cases.\n","id":"PMC4504518","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Public Library of

the extent of the epidemic, surveillance biases, and transmissibility","abstract":"Background\nThe novel Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) had, as of Aug 8, 2013, caused 111 virologically confirmed or probable human cases of infection worldwide.\n\n We analysed epidemiological and genetic data to assess the extent of human infection, the performance of case detection, and the transmission potential of MERS-CoV with and without control measures.\n\n\nMethods\nWe assembled a comprehensive database of all confirmed and probable cases from public sources and estimated the incubation period and generation time from case cluster data.\n\n Using data of numbers of visitors to the Middle East and their duration of stay, we estimated the number of symptomatic cases in the Middle East.\n\n We did independent analyses, looking at the growth in incident clusters, the growth in viral population, the reproduction number of cluster index cases, and cluster sizes to characterise the dynamical properties of the epidemic and the transmission scenario.\n\n\nFindings\nThe estimated number of symptomatic cases up to Aug 8, 2013, is 940 (95% CI 290–2200), indicating that at least 62% of human symptomatic cases have not been detected.\n\n We find that the case-fatality ratio of primary cases detected via routine surveillance (74%; 95% CI 49–91) is biased upwards because of detection bias; the case-fatality ratio of secondary cases was 20% (7–42).\n\n Detection of milder cases (or clinical management) seemed to have improved in recent months.\n\n Analysis of human clusters indicated that chains of transmission were not self-sustaining when infection control was implemented, but that R in the absence of controls was in the range 0·8–1·3. Three independent data sources provide evidence that R cannot be much above 1, with an upper bound of 1·2–1·5.\nInterpretation\nBy showing that a slowly growing epidemic is underway either in human beings or in an animal reservoir, quantification of uncertainty in transmissibility estimates, and provision of the first estimates of the scale of the epidemic and extent of case detection biases, we provide valuable information for more informed risk assessment.\n\n\nFunding\nMedical Research Council, Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation, EU FP7, and National Institute of General Medical Sciences.\n\n\n","id":"PMC3895322","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Cauchemez et al.

After we accounted for incomplete data for 17 patients who were still in hospital, we estimated the fatality risk for all ages to be 36% (95% CI 26–45) on admission to hospital.\n\n Risks of mechanical ventilation or fatality (69%, 95% CI 60–77) and of admission to an intensive care unit, mechanical ventilation, or fatality (83%, 76–90) were high.\n\n With assumptions about coverage of the sentinel surveillance network and health-care-seeking behaviour for patients with influenza-like illness associated with influenza A H7N9 virus infection, and pro-rata extrapolation, we estimated that the symptomatic case fatality risk could be between 160 (63–460) and 2800 (1000–9400) per 100?000 symptomatic cases.\n\n\nInterpretation\nHuman infections with avian influenza A H7N9 virus seem

Cumulative Incidence of Novel Influenza A/H1N1 in Foreign Travelers to Estimate Lower Bounds on Cumulative Incidence in Mexico","abstract":"Background\nAn accurate estimate of the total number of cases and severity of illness of an emerging infectious disease is required both to define the burden of the epidemic and to determine the severity of disease.\n\n When a novel pathogen first appears, affected individuals with severe symptoms are more likely to be diagnosed.\n\n Accordingly, the total number of cases will be underestimated and disease severity overestimated.\n\n This problem is manifest in the current epidemic of novel influenza A/H1N1.\nMethods and Results\nWe used a simple approach to leverage measures of incident influenza A/H1N1 among a relatively small and well observed group of US, UK, Spanish and Canadian travelers who had visited Mexico to estimate the incidence among a much larger and less well surveyed population of Mexican residents.\n\n We estimate that a minimum of 113,000 to 375,000 cases of novel influenza A/H1N1 have occurred in Mexicans during the month of April, 2009. Such an estimate serves as a lower bound because it does not account for underreporting of cases in travelers or for nonrandom mixing between Mexican residents and visitors, which together could increase the estimates by more than an order of magnitude.\n\n\nConclusions\nWe find that the number of cases in Mexican residents may exceed the number of confirmed cases by two to three orders of magnitude.\n\n While the extent of disease spread is greater than previously appreciated, our estimate suggests that severe disease is uncommon since the total number of cases is likely to be much larger than those of confirmed cases.\n\n\n","id":"PMC2731883","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Public Library of Science","authors":[{"firstname":"Marc","surname":"Lipsitch","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Martin","surname":"Lajous","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Justin J.","surname":"O'Hagan","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Ted","surname":"Cohen","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Joel C.","surname":"Miller","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Edward","surname":"Goldstein","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Leon","surname":"Danon","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Jacco","surname":"Wallinga","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Steven","surname":"Riley","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Scott F.","surname":"Dowell","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Carrie","surname":"Reed","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Meg","surname":"McCarron","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Alison P.","surname":"Galvani","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Alison P.","surname":"Galvani","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1093/aje/kwu213","date":"2014-07-17","title":"Optimizing the Precision of Case Fatality Ratio Estimates Under the Surveillance Pyramid Approach","abstract":"In the management of emerging infectious disease epidemics, precise and accurate estimation of severity indices, such as the probability of death after developing symptoms—the symptomatic case fatality ratio (sCFR)—is essential.\n Estimation of the sCFR may require merging data gathered through different surveillance systems and surveys.\n Since different surveillance strategies provide different levels of precision and accuracy, there is need for a theory to help investigators select the strategy that maximizes these properties.\n Here, we study the precision of sCFR estimators that combine data from several levels of the severity pyramid.\n We derive a formula for the standard error, which helps us find the estimator with the best precision given fixed resources.\n We further propose rules of thumb for guiding the choice of strategy: For example, should surveillance of a particular severity level be started? Which level should be preferred? We derive a formula for the optimal allocation of resources between chosen surveillance levels and provide a simple approximation that can be used in thinking more heuristically about planning surveillance.\n We illustrate these concepts with numerical examples corresponding to 3 influenza pandemic scenarios.\n Finally, we review the equally important issue of accuracy.\n","id":"PMC4240167","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Oxford University Press","authors":[{"firstname":"Camille","surname":"Pelat","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Neil M.","surname":"Ferguson","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Peter J.","surname":"White","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Carrie","surname":"Reed","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lyn","surname":"Finelli","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Simon","surname":"Cauchemez","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Christophe","surname":"Fraser","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1371/journal.pmed.1001103","date":"2011-08-12","title":"Estimating Infection Attack Rates and Severity in Real Time during an Influenza Pandemic: Analysis of Serial Cross-Sectional Serologic Surveillance Data","abstract":"This study reports that using serological data coupled with clinical surveillance data can provide real-time estimates of the infection attack rates and severity in an emerging influenza pandemic.\n","id":"PMC3186812","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Public Library of Science","authors":[{"firstname":"Joseph T.","surname":"Wu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Andrew","surname":"Ho","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Edward S.

Further research is urgently needed to guide clinicians, and we therefore prospectively evaluate the clinical outcomes of 114 severely ill patients with COVID-19 for short-term at the Union Hospital in Wuhan, China.\nMethods: In this single-centered, prospective, and observational study, we enrolled 114 severely ill patients with confirmed COVID-19 from Jan 23, 2020, to February 22, 2020. Epidemiological, demographic, laboratory, treatment, and outcome data were recorded, and the risk factors for poor outcome were analyzed.\nResults: Among the 114 enrolled patients with a mean age of 63.96 +- 13.41 years, 94 (82.5%) patients were classified as a good outcome group. Common clinical manifestations included fever, cough, and fatigue. Compared with the good outcome group, 20 (17.5%) patients in the poor outcome group more frequently exhibited lymphopenia, and lower levels of albumin, partial arterial oxygen pressure, higher levels of lactate dehydrogenase, creatine kinase, hypersensitive troponin I, C-reactive protein, ferritin, blood urea nitrogen, and D-dimer, as well as markedly higher levels of IL-6 and IL-10. Absolute numbers of T lymphocytes, CD8 + T cells, decreased in almost all the patients and were markedly lower in the poor outcome group than the good outcome group. We also found that traditional Chinese medicine can significantly improve the patient's condition, which is conducive to the transformation from a severe to mild condition. In addition, univariate and multivariate Cox analyses of potential factors for poor outcome patients indicated that cytokine storms and uncontrolled inflammation responses as well as liver, kidney, and cardiac dysfunction are related to the development of a poor outcome.\nConclusion: In summary, we reported this single-centered, prospective, and observational study for short-term outcome in severe patients with COVID-19. We found that cytokine storms and uncontrolled inflammation responses as well as liver, kidney, and cardiac dysfunction may play important roles in the final outcome of severely ill patients with COVID-19. Our study will allow clinicians to benefit and rapidly estimate the likelihood of a short-term poor outcome for severely ill patients.\nIntroduction\nA pneumonia caused by a novel coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), spread rapidly throughout worldwide in December 2019. Despite progress made in our understanding of the characteristics of the disease, there are currently no drugs to combat SARS-CoV-2, and patients are primarily provided with supportive treatment. Several studies have indicated that the main symptoms of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) include fever, cough, and dyspnea. Huang et al. described the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics of COVID-19, as well as various treatment strategies and outcomes, among 41 patients during the first wave of hospitalizations. They also compared clinical characteristics between patients treated in an intensive care unit (ICU) and those treated in non-ICU. Yang et al. also performed a detailed analysis of the patients critically ill with SARS-CoV-2 infection. In an analysis of 74 patients with COVID-19 exhibiting gastrointestinal symptoms, Jin et al. suggested that non-classical symptoms have been overlooked, posing a threat to the public. Wu et al. further noted that the risk of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and death is increased in older adults (&gt;=65 years old) with COVID-19. Guo et al. found that diabetes is a risk factor for patients with COVID-19. However, few prospective studies have explored the short-term outcomes of severely ill patients under current medical treatment and the risk factors that affect the short-term outcomes of severely ill patients, especially pneumonia patients with certain chronic diseases, which accounted for the majority of deaths. Here, we used a single-centered, prospective method to describe the basic clinical characteristics and short-term outcomes of severe patients in Union hospital, Wuhan, and we further aimed to explore the potential risk factors for poor outcomes among these patients using Cox proportional hazard models.\nMethods\nStudy Design and Participants\nThis single-center, prospective study included 114 severe patients with confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia hospitalized at the Union Hospital in Wuhan, China, which is a hospital designated to treat patients with COVID-19. From January 23, 2020, to February 22, 2020, we continuously enrolled patients diagnosed with COVID-19 based on interim guidance provided by the World Health Organization (WHO). Based on the Diagnosis and Treatment Scheme for SARS- CoV-2 of Chinese (The Seven Edition), severe patients were diagnosed if one or more of following criteria were met: dyspnea with respiratory rate (RR) &gt;=30 times/min, resting finger oxygen saturation &lt;=93%, and artery PaO2/FiO2 &lt;=300 mm Hg (1 mm Hg = 0.133 kPa). This study was approved by the Ethics Commission of Wuhan Union Hospital of Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology. Written informed consent was waived due to the emergency of this infectious diseases.\nData Collection\nData related to clinical characteristics were collected using a case record form modified from the standardized International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium case report form. Epidemiological and demographic data, including age, sex, and coexisting disorders, were also collected. The Baseline laboratory indices and radiographic findings were obtained from clinical electronic medical records. Moreover, the treatment strategies and outcomes were collected until the day of death /discharge or for the first 28 days after a diagnosis of severe illness, whichever was shorter. All missing or vague data, were obtained by communicating with patients and their families. All data were checked by two physicians (Xiaobo Feng and Liang Ma), and a third researcher (Wei Yang) adjudicated any difference in interpretation between the two primary reviewers.\nOutcomes\nClinical outcomes after 28 days of consecutive observations were divided into two categories. Patients that had been discharged, those whose condition had been deemed non-severe, and those not requiring mechanical ventilation were considered to have experienced good outcomes. Patients requiring mechanical ventilation and those who had died were considered to have experienced poor outcomes. The criteria for discharge were as follows: normal temperature for more than 3 days (T &lt; 37.3 C), significant improvement in respiratory symptoms, pulmonary imaging showing significant improvement in acute exudative lesions, and nucleic acid tests negative for respiratory tract specimens such as sputum and nasopharyngeal swabs for two consecutive samplings (at least 24 h after sampling). Patients with mild clinical symptoms and no signs of pneumonia on radiography were considered to be non-severe. ARDS and shock were confirmed by the WHO guidance for COVID-19. Acute kidney injury was defined according to the serum creatinine. Cardiac injury was identified by the serum concentration of hypersensitive cardiac troponin I (hsTNI) and, if it was above the upper limit of the reference range (&gt;28 pg/mL), measured in the laboratory of Union Hospital.\nStatistics\nContinuous variables were expressed as means +- SDs if normally distributed and medians (IQRs) if skewed distributed while categorical variables were summarized as number (%). Differences between the characteristics of outcome groups were assessed using students t-test or Mann-Whitney U-test for continuous variables and chi-square tests for categorical variables. In addition, univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazard models were used to determine hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of poor outcome in severe patients with COVID-19. The candidate risk factors included demographic and epidemiological characteristics as well as some laboratory indices. We determined the cut points of levels according to normal range, actual distribution, and clinical significance of each index. Adjustments were made for potential confounders, including age and sex. For risk factors identified in Cox analyses, we used restricted cubic spline model to further explore the potential dose-response relationship between factors and poor outcome risk. The referent (HR = 1) was set according to the cut point in Cox analyses. P &lt; 0.05 was considered statistically significant. All data were analyzed using SPSS (23.0 IBM SPSS).\nResults\nClinical Outcomes\nAs of March 21, 2020, a total of 114 patients diagnosed with and treated for severe COVID-19 were enrolled in this study. Twenty-eight days after a diagnosis of severe COVID-19, good and poor outcomes were observed in 94 and 20 patients, respectively. As shown in Figure 1, 51 (45%) patients were alive and had been discharged, 39 (34%) had transitioned to non-severe illness, four (3%) remained severely ill but did not require a ventilator, i.e., severe status and ventilator free, 11 (10%) were alive but remained ventilated, and nine (8%) had died.\nDistribution of short-term (28 days) outcomes of severely ill patients with COVID-19 (N = 114).\nDemographics and Characteristics\nThe general demographic and epidemiological characteristics of all enrolled patients are summarized in Table 1. The mean age was 63.96 +- 13.41 years, 62 (54.4%) were older than 65 years and 71 (62.3%) were male. A total of 89 (78.1%) severe patients have a chronic medical illness, and the most coexisting disorders were hypertension with 62 (54.4%), diabetes with 39 (34.2%) and cardiovascular disease with 31 (27.2%). No significant differences were observed in such characteristics between outcome groups (P &gt;= 0.05 for all). Table 2 displays the clinical characteristics of the patients. The duration from onset of symptoms to diagnosis of COVID-19 was 4.0 (2.0-7.0) days, while the duration from the onset of symptoms to the diagnosis of severe illness was 10.0 (6.0-14.3) days. For 114 patients, the most common symptoms at initial diagnosis were fever in 78 (68.4%), cough in 49 (43.0%), chest tightness in 34 (29.8%), and fatigue in 30 (26.3%) patients. Other symptoms, including shortness of breath in 18 (15.8%), anorexia in 12 (10.5%), chill in 12 (10.5%), myalgia in 10 (8.8%), sputum in nine (7.9%), headache in eight (7.0%), diarrhea in eight (7.0%), chest pain in three (2.6%), stomachache in three (2.6%) and nausea in three (2.6%) were relatively rare. As for oxygen saturation, patients in the poor outcome group had significantly lower levels than those in the good outcome group [median (IQR): 91 (90-93%) in the good outcome group and 81 (74-88%) in the bad outcome group, P &lt; 0.001].\nDemographic and epidemiological characteristics of severe patients with COVID-19.\n	Total (N = 114)	Good outcome (N = 94)	Poor outcome (N = 20)	P	 	Age (years)	63.96 +- 13.41	62.85 +- 13.65	69.15 +- 11.08	0.056	 	&lt;65	52 (45.6)	46 (48.9)	6 (30.0)	0.123	 	&gt;=65	62 (54.4)	48 (51.1)	14 (70.0)		 	Sex, male	71 (62.3)	58 (61.7)	13 (65.0)	0.782	 	Hospital infection	7 (6.1)	6 (6.4)	1 (5.0)	&gt;0.999	 	Coexisting disorders	89 (78.1)	73 (77.7)	16 (80.0)	&gt;0.999	 	Diabetes	39 (34.2)	34 (36.2)	5 (25.0)	0.339	 	Hypertension	62 (54.4)	50 (53.2)	12 (60.0)	0.579	 	Hyperlipidemia	17 (14.9)	15 (16.0)	2 (10.0)	0.739	 	Cardiovascular diseases	31 (27.2)	24 (25.5)	7 (35.0)	0.388	 	Cerebrovascular diseases	6 (5.3)	3 (3.2)	3 (15.0)	0.110	 	Cancer	10 (8.8)	9 (9.6)	1 (5.0)	0.825	 	Chronic renal diseases	6 (5.3)	4 (4.3)	2 (10.0)	0.622	 	Chronic liver diseases	4 (3.5)	3 (3.2)	1 (5.0)	0.543	 	Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease	11 (9.6)	9 (9.6)	2 (10.0)	&gt;0.999	 	Neuropsychiatric disorders	3 (2.6)	2 (2.1)	1 (5.0)	0.443	 	History of surgery	33 (28.9)	26 (27.7)	7 (35.0)	0.511	 	\nValues are n (%) for categorical data, means +- SDs for normally distributed data, or medians (IQRs) for non-normally distributed data.\nClinical characteristics of severe patients with COVID-19.\n	Total (N = 114)	Good outcome (N = 94)	Poor outcome (N = 20)	P	 	Onset of symptom to, d	 	Diagnosis	4.0 (2.0-7.0)	4.0 (2.0-7.0)	4.5 (2.3-10.8)	0.517	 	Serious illness	10.0 (6.0-14.3)	10.0 (6.0-15.0)	8.0 (5.0-14.0)	0.540	 	Signs and symptoms at initial	 	Fever	78 (68.4)	63 (67.0)	15 (75.0)	0.486	 	Chest tightness	34 (29.8)	27 (28.7)	7 (35.0)	0.577	 	Shortness of breath	18 (15.8)	13 (13.8)	5 (25.0)	0.365	 	Cough	49 (43.0)	39 (41.5)	10 (50.0)	0.485	 	Sputum	9 (7.9)	8 (8.5)	1 (5.0)	0.943	 	Fatigue	30 (26.3)	28 (29.8)	2 (10.0)	0.068	 	Headache	8 (7.0)	7 (7.4)	1 (5.0)	&gt;0.999	 	Myalgia	10 (8.8)	8 (8.5)	2 (10.0)	&gt;0.999	 	Chest pain	3 (2.6)	3 (3.2)	0 (0.0)	1.000	 	Anorexia	12 (10.5)	12 (12.8)	0 (0.0)	0.198	 	Chill	12 (10.5)	8 (8.5)	4 (20.0)	0.263	 	Stomachache	3 (2.6)	3 (3.2)	0 (0.0)	&gt;0.999	 	Diarrhea	8 (7.0)	7 (7.4)	1 (5.0)	&gt;0.999	 	Nausea	3 (2.6)	2 (2.1)	1 (5.0)	0.443	 	Temperature at disease onset ( C)	38.1 (36.7-38.8)	38.1 (36.7-38.7)	38.2 (37.0-39.0)	0.561	 	&lt;37.4	36 (31.6)	31 (33.0)	5 (25.0)	0.622	 	37.4-39.0	63 (55.3)	50 (53.2)	13 (65.0)		 	&gt;39.0	15 (13.2)	13 (13.8)	2 (10.0)		 	Signs and symptoms at hospital admission	 	Fever	32 (28.1)	25 (26.6)	7 (35.0)	0.448	 	Chest tightness	50 (43.9)	46 (48.9)	4 (20.0)	0.018	 	Shortness of breath	68 (59.6)	49 (52.1)	19 (95.0)	&lt;0.001	 	Cough	9 (7.9)	7 (7.4)	2 (10.0)	&gt;0.999	 	Fatigue	43 (37.7)	37 (39.4)	6 (30.0)	0.433	 	Headache	6 (5.3)	6 (6.4)	0 (0.0)	0.542	 	Myalgia	5 (4.4)	5 (5.3)	0 (0.0)	0.585	 	Chest pain	3 (2.6)	3 (3.2)	0 (0.0)	&gt;0.999	 	Anorexia	18 (15.8)	16 (17.0)	2 (10.0)	0.657	 	Diarrhea	10 (8.8)	7 (7.4)	3 (15.0)	0.516	 	Nausea	2 (1.8)	2 (2.1)	0 (0.0)	&gt;0.999	 	General signs at admission	 	Temperature ( C)	36.7 (36.4-37.4)	36.7 (36.4-37.3)	38.2 (37.0-39.0)	0.279	 	&lt;37.4	85 (74.6)	72 (76.6)	13 (65.0)	0.535	 	37.4-39.0	26 (22.8)	20 (21.3)	6 (30.0)		 	&gt;39.0	3 (2.6)	2 (2.1)	1 (5.0)		 	Heart rate (/min)	86 (78-102)	87 (78-102)	88 (78-102)	0.456	 	&lt;100	83 (72.8)	69 (73.4)	14 (70.0)	0.756	 	&gt;100	31 (27.2)	25 (26.6)	6 (30.0)		 	Respiratory rate (/min)	20 (20-23)	20 (20-22)	21 (20-30)	0.122	 	&lt;20	22 (19.3)	19 (20.2)	3 (15.0)	0.760	 	&gt;=20	92 (80.7)	75 (79.8)	17 (85.0)		 	Oxygen saturation (%)	90 (88-92)	91 (90-93)	81 (74-88)	&lt;0.001	 	&lt;90	35 (30.7)	19 (20.2)	16 (80.0)	&lt;0.001	 	&gt;=90	79 (69.3)	75 (79.8)	4 (20.0)		 	\nValues are n (%) for categorical data, means +- SDs for normally distributed data, or medians (IQRs) for non-normally distributed data.\nLaboratory and CT Findings\nIn terms of the 114 severe patients, many laboratory indicators differed significantly between outcome groups (Table 3). Compared with the good outcome group, the absolute counts of neutrophils 6.25 (4.69-9.20) vs. 3.48 (2.54-5.23), c-reactive protein 102.15 (78.07-122.90) vs. 48.95 (15.08-83.98), D dimer 2.10 (1.22-3.07) vs. 0.96 (0.41-.78), total bilirubin 19.20 (9.25-33.05) vs. 11.05 (8.53-14.05), blood urea nitrogen 9.02 (5.26-11.30) vs. 4.11 (3.11-5.04), creatine kinase 151.50 (50.50-218.50) vs. 62.00 (46.75-110.50), lactate dehydrogenase 638.00 (436.00-923.00) vs. 259.50 (213.75-382.50), hypersensitive cardiac troponin I 60.70 (18.48-298.98) vs. 4.10 (1.70-10.83), ferritin 679.00 (573.90-993.15) vs. 321.80 (231.00-532.88), interleukin-6 (IL-6) 76.10 (19.05-192.88) vs. 21.23 (7.23-47.61), and IL-10 6.59 (4.58-11.78) vs. 4.64 (3.65-6.18) were significantly higher in poor outcome. Besides, total protein 60.40 (56.78-64.05) vs. 63.80 (59.33-68.50) and PaO2 68.15 (49.00-77.75) vs. 81.00 (74.75-89.00) were significantly lower in poor outcome group. For chest X- ray/CT, 107 (93.9) patients had Ground-glass opacity. These data indicated that the uncontrolled inflammation responses, infection, liver, and kidney dysfunction, and hypoxia may contribute to poor outcomes in patients with COVID-19.\nLaboratory and

including acute liver injury, ARDS, acute kidney injury, arrhythmia, acute myocardial injury, Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation (DIC), rhabdomyolysis, and septic shock. However, no patients in the good outcome group experienced septic shock. All patients in the poor outcome group experienced ARDS. Acute myocardial injury, acute kidney injury, arrhythmia, rhabdomyolysis, and DIC were significantly higher than their counterparts in 13.8, 22.3, 17.0, 2.1, and 2.1% of patients with COVID-19 in the good outcome group, respectively. All 114 patients with severe COVID-19 were treated with antibiotics and high flow nasal cannula, while 25 (21.9%) were treated with non-invasive mechanical ventilation and 22 (19.3%) with invasive mechanical ventilation treatment. Six (5.3%) patients were treated with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) and all of whom were in the poor outcome group. Almost all [113 (99.1%)] patients received antiviral treatment, including arbidol hydrochloride capsules (0.2 g three times daily), lopinavir, and ribavirin (500 mg two times daily) via the oral route. Furthermore, as many as 41.2% patients received glucocorticoid therapy. Sixty-four (56.1%) patients received immunoglobulin treatment, and 49 (43.0%) patients were treated with parenteral nutrition; the percentage was higher in the poor outcome group than in the good outcome group [20 (100.0%) vs. 29 (30.9%)].

Our results indicated that, for severe patients, higher levels of oxygen saturation (HR, 0.123; 95% CI, 0.041-0.369), albumin (HR, 0.060; 95% CI, 0.008-0.460), and arterial partial pressure of oxygen (HR, 0.321; 95% CI, 0.106-0.973) were associated with decreased risk of developing poor outcome within 28 days. In the other hand, higher levels of leucocytes (HR, 5.575; 95% CI, 2.080-14.943), neutrophils (HR, 2.566; 95% CI, 1.022-6.443), total bilirubin (HR, 6.171; 95% CI, 2.458-15.496), globulin (HR, 2.526; 95% CI, 1.027-6.211), blood urea nitrogen (HR, 5.640; 95% CI, 2.193-14.509), creatine kinase-MB (HR, 3.032; 95% CI, 1.203-7.644), lactate dehydrogenase (HR, 4.607; 95% CI, 1.057-20.090), hypersensitive cardiac troponin I (HR, 5.023; 95% CI, 1.921-13.136), lactate concentration (HR,15.721; 95% CI, 2.099-117.777), Interleukin-10 (HR, 3.551; 95% CI, 1.280-9.857), and C-reactive protein (HR, 5.275; 95% CI, 1.517-18.344) were associated with increased risk of poor outcome development. For all the factors analyzed above, increased concentration of lactate (&gt;=1.6 mmol/L) and total bilirubin (&gt;=19.0 mumol/L) might be the most important predictors of poor outcome in the early stage. As shown in Figure 2, non-linear dose-response relationship was also found between 10 indices and poor outcome risk in the cubic spline model.\nUnivariate and multivariate analyses of potential

Previous studies have shown that 20% of COVID-19 patients developed critical disease due to hypoxia or respiratory failure. Among them, 5% require treatment in the ICU, while 15% require oxygen and essential care. This suggests that this is particularly important in understanding this part of the patient. Recently, Dong et al. found that children, particularly infants, developed severe outcomes. This indicated that patients of any age could develop severe illness. Feng et al. found that severe and critical patients with the typical characteristics of multiple organ and immune function dysfunction. They also found that older people aged &gt;= 75 years are a risk factor for mortality. With the increase number of asymptomatic infectious patients, taking measures to detect and isolate early are especially important. In our study, we used a short-term method to prospectively study the reported the epidemiology and risk factors of 114 severe patients with COVID-19 from the Union hospital, Hubei province. To our knowledge, this is the first report to describes the severe patients with COVID-19 during a short-term observation and predict some risk factors for final outcome. In our study, the mean age of severe patients were 63.96 +- 13.41 years, and 58 (50.9%) were older than 65 years; the patients are thus older than in other studies. We also found that 78 (68.4%) of 114 patients initially exhibited fever, in accordance with previous studies, where fever is the one of the most common symptom in patients who had COVID-19. But, 36 (31.6%) of 114 severe patients did not exhibit fever at the beginning of illness, and other clinical manifestations should therefore be concerned. Recently, Jin et al. found that attention should also be paid to people who have gastrointestinal symptoms. Mao et al. indicated that clinicians should suspect COVID-19 also in patients with neurological manifestations.\nAccording to results from laboratory tests, the poor outcome group had lower lymphocytes than the good outcome group [0.67 (0.43-0.89) vs. 0.92 (0.70-1.43)]. As is known to all, lymphocytes are the main fighting force against the virus, and we suspected that SARS-CoV-2 damages the lymphocyte and causes its reduction. Chen et al. found that severe lymphopenia were persistent and we more increased in dead patients than recovered patients, and they suggested that lymphopenia may be associated with poor outcome. Tan et al. demonstrated a contrasting result: lymphopenia is an effective indicator for the severity of patients with COVID-19. CD8+ T cells were significantly lower in the poor outcome group. Chen et al. indicated that the SARS-CoV-2 infection may affect CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocyte cells in particular and argue that this is a potential correlation with COVID-19 severity. In addition, markedly higher concentrations of cardiac troponin I, creatine kinase, and lactate dehydrogenase could be observed in the poor outcome group than in their counterpart. Most notably, patients who exhibited a poor outcome may develop pulmonary and extra-pulmonary organ damage, including septic shock, acute respiratory distress syndrome, acute kidney injury, acute cardiac injury, as well as disseminated intravascular coagulation. The fatality risk of COVID-19 patients with or without a history of previous cardiovascular disease may include acute cardiac injury and heart failure. Costanza Emanueli et al. suggested that the COVID-19 crisis will have long-term residual repercussions on the cardiovascular system. The suggestion is that the cardiac injury also requires special attention. In our study, we also found that lactate concentration was higher in poor outcomes than their counterpart. Lactate is generally the end product of energy through anaerobic metabolism, and the elevation of lactate levels is mainly caused by the increase of blood oxygen deficiency and anaerobic metabolism; this result is consistent with the lower oxygen saturation in the poor group, and this indicated that lactate level is an important predictor of poor outcome in the early stage. In addition, total bilirubin was also an important predictor of poor outcome in the early stage. Qi recommend that dynamic monitoring of the liver function of patients is necessary. Cai et al. conclude that patients with abnormal liver function may had higher risks of progressing to severe disease. Due to the &quot;cytokine storm&quot; also observed in the poor outcome group, 19 (95.0%) of these patients were given glucocorticoid therapy. Wu et al. previously found that the administration of methylprednisolone may have reduced the risk of death in patients with ARDS. To our surprise, most of the severe patients treated with Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) were eventually converted to a good outcome, indicating the importance of this effort on COVID-19. A large of clinical practice results indicated that TCM shows significant role in the patients with COVID-19. For the severe patients in the treatment of TCM, the mean length in hospital and the time of nucleic acid turning negative has been shortened by more than 2 days. Yang et al. analyzed the effect of Lian Hua Qing Wen Capsules in the treatment of COVID-19 patients, and they found that this TCM could markedly relieve fever and cough and promote recovery. Besides, a comprehensive evaluation and further scientific research should be carried out on the effect of TCM on COVID-19.\nMeantime, the risk factors related to the poor outcome included uncontrolled inflammation responses, infection, hypoxia, and liver, kidney, and cardiac dysfunction. The pathogenesis of COVID-19 is still being studied. Cytokine storms and uncontrolled inflammation responses are thought to play important roles in the outcome of COVID-19. External stimuli resulted in an excessive immune response, and the pathogenesis of the cytokine storm is complex and can leaded to rapid disease progression and high mortality. The inflammatory cytokine storm is closely correlated to the development and progression of ARDS. Neutrophils play important role in chemokines and cytokines. In our study, the poor outcome group had significantly higher neutrophil counts than the good outcome group, and this may be the underlying cause of the cytokine storm. In addition, CD8+ T cells were significantly lower in the poor outcome group. These results highlight the important roles of CD8+ T cells in COVID-19. Studies had shown that T cells could inhibit the over-activation of innate immunity. T cells can help to clear SARS-CoV, and a low T-cell response can result in pathological changes in mice with SARS-CoV. The relevant mechanisms need to be studied further.\nThis study has some limitations. First, owing to the limited number of cases, only 114 severe patients were included. Second, this study was a single-center research, and a larger cohort study of severe patients with SARS-CoV-2 from other cities in China and other countries would help to further describe the clinical characteristics and predict risk factors related to this disease. Third, although we included numerous factors that may be associated with clinical outcome in the analyses and made adjustment for potential confounders when exploring the associations, we could not rule out the possibility of other residual confounders.\nIn summary, the present study is a single-center, prospective observational study that examined clinical characteristics and risk factors for poor short-term outcomes in patients with severe COVID-19. Our univariate and multivariate analyses demonstrated that cytokine storm/uncontrolled inflammatory responses as well as liver, kidney, and cardiac dysfunction may play important roles in determining final outcomes in patients with severe illness due to COVID-19 infection. Our data may aid clinicians in diagnosing severe cases of COVID-19 and determining the most appropriate treatment strategies for infected patients. Given that Traditional Chinese medicine has been shown to improve outcomes in some cases, additional studies are also required to assess the efficacy of such strategies.\nData Availability Statement\nThe raw data supporting the conclusions of this article will be made available by the authors, without undue reservation.\nEthics Statement\nThe studies involving human participants were reviewed and approved by the Ethics Commission of Wuhan Union Hospital of Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology.

patients with suspected 2019-nCoV were admitted to a designated hospital in Wuhan.\n\n We prospectively collected and analysed data on patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection by real-time RT-PCR and next-generation sequencing.\n\n Data were obtained with standardised data collection forms shared by WHO and the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium from electronic medical records.\n\n Researchers also directly communicated with patients or their families to ascertain epidemiological and symptom data.\n\n Outcomes were also compared between patients who had been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and those who had not.\n\n\nFindings\nBy Jan 2, 2020, 41 admitted hospital patients had been identified as having laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection.\n\n Most of the infected patients were men (30 [73%] of 41); less than half had underlying diseases (13 [32%]), including diabetes (eight [20%]), hypertension

associated with a novel coronavirus was reported in Wuhan city, Hubei province, China.\n\n Affected patients were geographically linked with a local wet market as a potential source.\n\n No data on person-to-person or nosocomial transmission have been published to date.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this study, we report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, radiological, and microbiological findings of five patients in a family cluster who presented with unexplained pneumonia after returning to Shenzhen, Guangdong province, China, after a visit to Wuhan, and an additional family member who did not travel to Wuhan.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of genetic sequences from these patients were done.\n\n\nFindings\nFrom Jan 10, 2020, we enrolled a family of six patients who travelled to Wuhan from Shenzhen between Dec 29, 2019 and Jan 4, 2020. Of six family members who travelled to Wuhan, five were identified as infected with the novel coronavirus.\n\n Additionally, one family member, who did not travel to Wuhan, became infected with the virus after several days of contact with four of the family members.\n\n None of the family members had contacts with Wuhan markets or animals, although two had visited a Wuhan hospital.\n\n Five family members (aged 36–66 years) presented with fever, upper or lower respiratory tract symptoms, or diarrhoea, or a combination of these 3–6 days after exposure.\n\n They presented to our hospital (The University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen) 6–10 days after symptom onset.\n\n They and one asymptomatic child (aged 10 years) had radiological ground-glass lung opacities.\n\n Older patients (aged &gt;60 years) had more systemic symptoms, extensive radiological ground-glass lung changes, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and increased C-reactive protein and lactate dehydrogenase levels.\n\n The nasopharyngeal or throat swabs of these six patients were negative for known respiratory microbes by point-of-care multiplex RT-PCR, but five patients (four adults and the child) were RT-PCR positive for genes encoding the internal RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and surface Spike protein of this novel coronavirus, which were confirmed by Sanger sequencing.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these five patients' RT-PCR amplicons and two full genomes by next-generation sequencing showed that this is a novel coronavirus, which is closest to the bat severe acute respiatory syndrome (SARS)-related coronaviruses found in Chinese horseshoe bats.\n\n\nInterpretation\nOur findings are consistent with person-to-person transmission of this novel coronavirus in hospital and family settings, and the reports of infected travellers in other geographical regions.\n\n\nFunding\nThe Shaw Foundation Hong Kong, Michael Seak-Kan Tong, Respiratory Viral Research Foundation Limited, Hui

January 2020. We analyzed data on the first 425 confirmed cases in Wuhan to determine the epidemiologic characteristics of NCIP.\n\n\nMethods\nWe collected information on demographic characteristics, exposure history, and illness timelines of laboratory-confirmed cases of NCIP that had been reported by January 22, 2020. We described characteristics of the cases and estimated the key epidemiologic time-delay distributions.\n\n In the early period of exponential growth, we estimated the epidemic doubling time and the basic reproductive number.\n\n\nResults\nAmong the first 425 patients with confirmed NCIP, the median age was 59 years and 56% were male.\n\n The majority of cases (55%) with onset before January 1, 2020, were linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, as compared with 8.6% of the subsequent cases.\n\n The mean incubation period was 5.2 days (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.1 to 7.0), with the 95th percentile of the distribution at 12.5 days.\n\n In its early stages, the epidemic doubled in size every 7.4 days.\n\n With a mean serial interval of 7.5 days (95% CI, 5.3 to 19), the basic reproductive number was estimated to be 2.2 (95% CI, 1.4 to 3.9).\n\n\nConclusions\nOn the basis of this information, there is evidence that human-to-human transmission has occurred among close contacts since the middle of December 2019.

outcomes in patients with a number of different malignancies.\n\n The objective of this study was to assess the relationship between NLR and mortality in a population of adult critically ill patients.\n\n\nMethods\nWe performed an observational cohort study of unselected intensive care unit (ICU) patients based on records in a large clinical database.\n\n We computed individual patient NLR and categorized patients by quartile of this ratio.\n\n The association of NLR quartiles and 28-day mortality was assessed using multivariable logistic regression.\n\n Secondary outcomes included mortality in the ICU, in-hospital mortality and 1-year mortality.\n\n An a priori subgroup analysis of patients with versus without sepsis was performed to assess any differences in the relationship between the NLR and outcomes in these cohorts.\n\n\nResults\nA total of 5,056 patients were included.\n\n Their 28-day mortality rate was 19%.\n\n The median age of the cohort was 65 years, and 47% were female.\n\n The median NLR for the entire cohort was 8.9 (interquartile range, 4.99 to 16.21).\n\n Following multivariable adjustments, there was a stepwise increase in mortality with increasing quartiles of NLR (first quartile: reference category; second quartile odds ratio (OR) = 1.32; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.03 to 1.71; third quartile OR = 1.43; 95% CI, 1.12 to 1.83; 4th quartile OR = 1.71; 95% CI, 1.35 to 2.16).\n\n A similar stepwise relationship was identified in the subgroup of patients who presented without sepsis.\n\n The NLR was not associated with 28-day mortality in patients with sepsis.\n\n Increasing quartile of NLR was statistically significantly associated with secondary outcome.\n\n\nConclusion\nThe NLR is associated with outcomes in unselected critically ill patients.\n\n In patients with sepsis, there was no statistically significant relationship between NLR and mortality.\n\n Further investigation is required to increase understanding of the

Epidemiological investigations have suggested that the outbreak was associated with a seafood market in Wuhan.\n Here we study a single patient who was a worker at the market and who was admitted to the Central Hospital of Wuhan on 26 December 2019 while experiencing a severe respiratory syndrome that included fever, dizziness and a cough.\n Metagenomic RNA sequencing4 of a sample of

retrospective, observational study","abstract":"Background\nAn ongoing outbreak of pneumonia associated with the severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) started in December, 2019, in Wuhan, China.\n\n Information about critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection is scarce.\n\n We aimed to describe the clinical course and outcomes of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this single-centered, retrospective, observational study, we enrolled 52 critically ill adult patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia who were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) of Wuhan Jin Yin-tan hospital (Wuhan, China) between late December, 2019, and Jan 26, 2020. Demographic data, symptoms, laboratory values, comorbidities, treatments, and clinical outcomes were all collected.\n\n Data were compared between survivors and non-survivors.\n\n The primary outcome was 28-day mortality, as of Feb 9, 2020. Secondary outcomes included incidence of SARS-CoV-2-related acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and the proportion of patients requiring mechanical ventilation.\n\n\nFindings\nOf 710 patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, 52 critically ill adult patients were included.\n\n The mean age of the 52 patients was 59·7 (SD 13·3) years, 35 (67%) were men, 21 (40%) had chronic illness, 51 (98%) had fever.\n\n 32 (61·5%) patients had died at 28 days, and the median duration from admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) to death was 7 (IQR 3–11) days for non-survivors.\n\n Compared with survivors, non-survivors were older (64·6 years [11·2] vs 51·9 years [12·9]), more likely to develop ARDS (26 [81%] patients vs 9 [45%] patients), and more likely to receive mechanical ventilation (30 [94%] patients vs 7 [35%] patients), either invasively or non-invasively.\n\n Most patients had organ function damage, including 35 (67%) with ARDS, 15 (29%) with acute kidney injury, 12 (23%) with cardiac injury, 15 (29%) with liver dysfunction, and one (2%) with pneumothorax.\n\n 37 (71%) patients required mechanical ventilation.\n\n Hospital-acquired infection occurred in seven (13·5%) patients.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe mortality of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia is considerable.\n\n The survival time of the non-survivors is likely to be within 1–2 weeks after ICU admission.\n\n Older patients (&gt;65 years) with comorbidities and ARDS are at increased risk of death.\n\n The severity of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia poses great strain on critical care resources in hospitals, especially if they are not adequately staffed or resourced.\n\n\nFunding\nNone.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7102538","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Elsevier

Cases exported domestically were then estimated.\n\n We forecasted the national and global spread of 2019-nCoV, accounting for the effect of the metropolitan-wide quarantine of Wuhan and surrounding cities, which began Jan 23–24, 2020. We used data on monthly flight bookings from the Official Aviation Guide and data on human mobility across more than 300 prefecture-level cities in mainland China from the Tencent database.\n\n Data on confirmed cases were obtained from the reports published by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\n Serial interval estimates were based on previous studies of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV).\n\n A susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered metapopulation model was used to simulate the epidemics across all major cities in China.\n\n The basic reproductive number was estimated using Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods and presented using the resulting posterior mean and 95% credibile interval (CrI).\n\n\nFindings\nIn our baseline scenario, we estimated that the basic reproductive number for 2019-nCoV was 2·68 (95% CrI 2·47–2·86) and that 75?815 individuals (95% CrI 37?304–130?330) have been infected in Wuhan as of Jan 25, 2020. The epidemic doubling time was 6·4 days (95% CrI 5·8–7·1).\n\n We estimated that in the baseline scenario, Chongqing, Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Shenzhen had imported 461 (95% CrI 227–805), 113 (57–193), 98 (49–168), 111 (56–191), and 80 (40–139) infections from Wuhan, respectively.\n\n If the transmissibility of 2019-nCoV were similar everywhere domestically and over time, we inferred that epidemics are already growing exponentially in multiple major cities of China with a lag time behind the Wuhan outbreak of about 1–2 weeks.\n\n\nInterpretation\nGiven that 2019-nCoV is no longer contained within Wuhan, other major Chinese cities are probably sustaining localised outbreaks.\n\n Large cities overseas with close transport links to China could also become outbreak epicentres, unless substantial public health interventions at both the population and personal levels are implemented immediately.\n\n Independent self-sustaining outbreaks in major cities globally could become inevitable because of substantial exportation of presymptomatic cases and in the absence of large-scale public health interventions.\n\n Preparedness plans and mitigation interventions should be

implications for virus origins and receptor binding","abstract":"Background\nIn late December, 2019, patients presenting with viral pneumonia due to an unidentified microbial agent were reported in Wuhan, China.\n\n A novel coronavirus was subsequently identified as the causative pathogen, provisionally named 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).\n\n As of Jan 26, 2020, more than 2000 cases of 2019-nCoV infection have been confirmed, most of which involved people living in or visiting Wuhan, and human-to-human transmission has been confirmed.\n\n\nMethods\nWe did next-generation sequencing of samples from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and cultured isolates from nine inpatients, eight of whom had visited the Huanan seafood market in Wuhan.\n\n Complete and partial 2019-nCoV genome sequences were obtained from these individuals.\n\n Viral contigs were connected using Sanger sequencing to obtain the full-length genomes, with the terminal regions determined by rapid amplification of cDNA ends.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these 2019-nCoV genomes and those of other coronaviruses was used to determine the evolutionary history of the virus and help infer its likely origin.\n\n Homology modelling was done to explore the likely receptor-binding properties of the virus.\n\n\nFindings\nThe ten genome sequences of 2019-nCoV obtained from the nine patients were extremely similar, exhibiting more than 99·98% sequence identity.\n\n Notably, 2019-nCoV was closely related (with 88% identity) to two bat-derived severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-like coronaviruses, bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21, collected in 2018 in Zhoushan, eastern China, but were more distant from SARS-CoV (about 79%) and MERS-CoV (about 50%).\n\n Phylogenetic analysis revealed that 2019-nCoV fell within the subgenus Sarbecovirus of the genus Betacoronavirus, with a relatively long branch length to its closest relatives bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21, and was genetically distinct from SARS-CoV.\n\n Notably, homology modelling revealed that 2019-nCoV had a similar receptor-binding domain structure to that of SARS-CoV, despite amino acid variation at some key residues.\n\n\nInterpretation\n2019-nCoV is sufficiently divergent from SARS-CoV to be considered a new human-infecting betacoronavirus.\n\n Although our phylogenetic analysis suggests that bats might be the original host of this virus, an animal sold at the seafood market in Wuhan might represent an intermediate host facilitating the emergence of the virus in humans.\n\n Importantly, structural analysis suggests that 2019-nCoV might be able to bind to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor in humans.\n\n The future evolution, adaptation, and spread of this virus warrant urgent investigation.\n\n\nFunding\nNational Key Research and Development Program of China, National Major Project for Control and Prevention of Infectious Disease in China, Chinese Academy of Sciences,

world on alert.\n 2019-nCoV is reminiscent of the SARS-CoV outbreak in 2002 to 2003. Our decade-long structural studies on the receptor recognition by SARS-CoV have identified key interactions between SARS-CoV spike protein and its host receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which regulate both the cross-species and human-to-human transmissions of SARS-CoV.\n One of the goals of SARS-CoV research was to build an atomic-level iterative framework of virus-receptor interactions to facilitate epidemic surveillance, predict species-specific receptor usage, and identify potential animal hosts and animal models of viruses.\n Based on the sequence of 2019-nCoV spike protein, we apply this predictive framework to provide novel insights into the receptor usage and likely host range of 2019-nCoV.\n This study provides a robust test of this reiterative framework, providing the basic, translational, and public health research communities with predictive insights that may help study and battle this novel

coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) strains.\n The molecular mechanisms regulating emerging coronavirus pathogenesis are complex and include virus–host interactions associated with entry, replication, egress and innate immune control.\n Epigenetics research investigates the genetic and non-genetic factors that regulate phenotypic variation, usually caused by external and environmental factors that alter host expression patterns and performance without any change in the underlying genotype.\n Epigenetic modifications, such as histone modifications, DNA methylation, chromatin remodeling, and non-coding RNAs, function as important regulators that remodel host chromatin, altering host expression patterns and networks in a highly flexible manner.\n For most of the past two and a half decades, research has focused on the molecular mechanisms by which RNA viruses antagonize the signaling and sensing components that regulate induction of the host innate immune and antiviral defense programs upon infection.\n More recently, a growing body of evidence supports the hypothesis that viruses, even lytic RNA viruses that replicate in the cytoplasm, have developed intricate, highly evolved, and well-coordinated processes that are designed to regulate the host epigenome, and control host innate immune antiviral defense processes, thereby promoting robust virus replication and pathogenesis.\n In this article, we discuss the strategies that are used to evaluate the mechanisms by which viruses regulate the host epigenome, especially focusing on highly pathogenic respiratory RNA virus infections as a model.\n By combining measures of epigenome reorganization with RNA and proteomic datasets, we articulate a spatial-temporal data integration approach to identify regulatory genomic clusters and regions that play a crucial role in the host’s innate immune response, thereby defining a new viral antagonism

of 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID?19).\n\n\nMethods\nA total of 174 consecutive patients confirmed with COVID?19 were studied.\n\n Demographic data, medical history, symptoms and signs, laboratory findings, chest computed tomography (CT) as well the treatment measures were collected and analysed.\n\n\nResults\nWe found that COVID?19 patients without other comorbidities but with diabetes (n = 24) were at higher risk of severe pneumonia, release of tissue injury?related enzymes, excessive uncontrolled inflammation responses and hypercoagulable state associated with dysregulation of glucose metabolism.\n\n Furthermore, serum levels of inflammation?related biomarkers such as IL?6, C?reactive protein, serum ferritin and coagulation index, D?dimer, were significantly higher (P &lt;?.\n\n01) in diabetic patients compared with those without, suggesting that patients with diabetes are more susceptible to an inflammatory storm eventually leading to rapid deterioration of COVID?19.\nConclusions\nOur data support the notion that diabetes should be considered as a risk factor for a rapid progression and bad prognosis of COVID?19. More intensive attention should be paid to patients with diabetes, in case of rapid deterioration.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7228407","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.","authors":[{"firstname":"Weina","surname":"Guo","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Mingyue","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Yalan","surname":"Dong","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Haifeng","surname":"Zhou","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Zili","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Chunxia","surname":"Tian","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Renjie","surname":"Qin","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Haijun","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Yin","surname":"Shen","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Keye","surname":"Du","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Lei","surname":"Zhao","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Heng","surname":"Fan","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Shanshan","surname":"Luo","email":"shsh689@126.com","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Desheng","surname":"Hu","email":"desheng.hu@hust.edu.cn","contributions":"1"}],"References depth 2":[]},{"doi":"10.1097/CM9.0000000000000819","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Diagnosis and Treatment Protocol for Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia (Trial Version 7)","abstract":"","id":"PMC7213636","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Wolters Kluwer Health","authors":[{"firstname":"Pei-Fang","surname":"Wei","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}],"References depth 2":[]},{"doi":"10.1001/jama.2020.2648","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Characteristics of and important lessons from the Coronavirus Disease 2019.

China.\n\n We aimed to further clarify the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of 2019-nCoV pneumonia.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this retrospective, single-centre study, we included all confirmed cases of 2019-nCoV in Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital from Jan 1 to Jan 20, 2020. Cases were confirmed by real-time RT-PCR and were analysed for epidemiological, demographic, clinical, and radiological features and laboratory data.\n\n Outcomes were followed up until Jan 25, 2020.\nFindings\nOf the 99 patients with 2019-nCoV pneumonia, 49 (49%) had a history of exposure to the Huanan seafood market.\n\n The average age of the patients was 55·5 years (SD 13·1), including 67 men and 32 women.\n\n 2019-nCoV was detected in all patients by real-time RT-PCR.\n\n 50 (51%) patients had chronic diseases.\n\n Patients had clinical manifestations of fever (82 [83%] patients), cough (81 [82%] patients), shortness of breath (31 [31%] patients), muscle ache (11 [11%] patients), confusion (nine [9%] patients), headache (eight [8%] patients), sore throat (five [5%] patients), rhinorrhoea (four [4%] patients), chest pain (two [2%] patients), diarrhoea (two [2%] patients), and nausea and vomiting (one [1%] patient).\n\n According to imaging examination, 74 (75%) patients showed bilateral pneumonia, 14 (14%) patients showed multiple mottling and ground-glass opacity, and one (1%) patient had pneumothorax.\n\n 17 (17%) patients developed acute respiratory distress syndrome and, among them, 11 (11%) patients worsened in a short period of time and died of multiple organ failure.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe 2019-nCoV infection was of clustering onset, is more likely to affect older males with comorbidities, and can result in severe and even fatal respiratory diseases such as acute respiratory distress syndrome.\n\n In general, characteristics of patients who died were in line with the MuLBSTA score, an early warning model for predicting mortality in viral pneumonia.\n\n Further investigation is needed to explore the applicability of the MuLBSTA score in

the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatment and clinical outcomes of these patients.\n\n\nMethods\nAll patients with suspected 2019-nCoV were admitted to a designated hospital in Wuhan.\n\n We prospectively collected and analysed data on patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection by real-time RT-PCR and next-generation sequencing.\n\n Data were obtained with standardised data collection forms shared by WHO and the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium from electronic medical records.\n\n Researchers also directly communicated with patients or their families to ascertain epidemiological and symptom data.\n\n Outcomes were also compared between patients who had been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and those who had not.\n\n\nFindings\nBy Jan 2, 2020, 41 admitted hospital patients had been identified as having laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection.\n\n Most of the infected patients were men (30 [73%] of 41); less than half had underlying diseases (13 [32%]), including diabetes (eight [20%]), hypertension (six [15%]), and cardiovascular disease (six [15%]).\n\n Median age was 49·0 years (IQR 41·0–58·0).\n\n 27 (66%) of 41 patients had been exposed to Huanan seafood market.\n\n One family cluster was found.\n\n Common symptoms at onset of illness were fever (40 [98%] of 41 patients), cough (31 [76%]), and myalgia or fatigue (18 [44%]); less common symptoms were sputum production (11 [28%] of 39), headache (three [8%] of 38), haemoptysis (two [5%] of 39), and diarrhoea (one [3%] of 38).\n\n Dyspnoea developed in 22 (55%) of 40 patients (median time from illness onset to dyspnoea 8·0 days [IQR 5·0–13·0]).\n\n 26 (63%) of 41 patients had lymphopenia.\n\n All 41 patients had pneumonia with abnormal findings on chest CT.\n\n Complications included acute respiratory distress syndrome (12 [29%]), RNAaemia (six [15%]), acute cardiac injury (five [12%]) and secondary infection (four [10%]).\n\n 13 (32%) patients were admitted to an ICU and six (15%) died.\n\n Compared with non-ICU patients, ICU patients had higher plasma levels of IL2, IL7, IL10, GSCF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNF?.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe 2019-nCoV infection caused clusters of severe respiratory illness similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and was associated with

(covid-19) who died.\n\n\nDesign\nRetrospective case series.\n\n\nSetting\nTongji Hospital in Wuhan, China.\n\n\nParticipants\nAmong a cohort of 799 patients, 113 who died and 161 who recovered with a diagnosis of covid-19 were analysed.\n\n Data were collected until 28 February 2020.\nMain outcome measures\nClinical characteristics and laboratory findings were obtained from electronic medical records with data collection forms.\n\n\nResults\nThe median age of deceased patients (68 years) was significantly older than recovered patients (51 years).\n\n Male sex was more predominant in deceased patients (83; 73%) than in recovered patients (88; 55%).\n\n Chronic hypertension and other cardiovascular comorbidities were more frequent among deceased patients (54 (48%) and 16 (14%)) than recovered patients (39 (24%) and 7 (4%)).\n\n Dyspnoea, chest tightness, and disorder of consciousness were more common in deceased patients (70 (62%), 55 (49%), and 25 (22%)) than in recovered patients (50 (31%), 48 (30%), and 1 (1%)).\n\n The median time from disease onset to death in deceased patients was 16 (interquartile range 12.0-20.0) days.\n\n Leukocytosis was present in 56 (50%) patients who died and 6 (4%) who recovered, and lymphopenia was present in 103 (91%) and 76 (47%) respectively.\n\n Concentrations of alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, creatinine, creatine kinase, lactate dehydrogenase, cardiac troponin I, N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide, and D-dimer were markedly higher in deceased patients than in recovered patients.\n\n Common complications observed more frequently in deceased patients included acute respiratory distress syndrome (113; 100%), type I respiratory failure (18/35; 51%), sepsis (113; 100%), acute cardiac injury (72/94; 77%), heart failure (41/83; 49%), alkalosis (14/35; 40%), hyperkalaemia (42; 37%), acute kidney injury (28; 25%), and hypoxic encephalopathy (23; 20%).\n\n Patients with cardiovascular comorbidity were more likely to develop cardiac complications.\n\n Regardless of history of cardiovascular disease, acute cardiac injury and heart failure were more common in deceased patients.\n\n\nConclusion\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection can cause both pulmonary and systemic inflammation, leading to multi-organ dysfunction in patients at high risk.\n\n Acute respiratory distress syndrome and respiratory failure, sepsis, acute cardiac injury, and heart failure were the most common critical complications during exacerbation of covid-19.\n","id":"PMC7190011","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"BMJ Publishing Group

Aims\nRecent data on the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has begun to shine light on the impact of the disease on the liver.\n\n But no studies to date have systematically described liver test abnormalities in patients with COVID-19. We evaluated the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 in patients with abnormal liver test results.\n\n\nMethods\nClinical records and laboratory results were obtained from 417 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 who were admitted to the only referral hospital in Shenzhen, China from January 11 to February 21, 2020 and followed up to March 7, 2020. Information on clinical features of patients with abnormal liver tests were collected for analysis.\n\n\nResults\nOf 417 patients with COVID-19, 318 (76.3%) had abnormal liver test results and 90 (21.5%) had liver injury during hospitalization.\n\n The presence of abnormal liver tests became more pronounced during hospitalization within 2 weeks, with 49 (23.4%), 31 (14.8%), 24 (11.5%) and 51 (24.4%) patients having alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, total bilirubin and gamma-glutamyl transferase levels elevated to more than 3× the upper limit of normal, respectively.\n\n Patients with abnormal liver tests of hepatocellular type or mixed type at admission had higher odds of progressing to severe disease (odds ratios [ORs] 2.73; 95% CI 1.19–6.3, and 4.44, 95% CI 1.93–10.23, respectively).\n\n The use of lopinavir/ritonavir was also found to lead to increased odds of liver injury (OR from 4.44 to 5.03, both p &lt;0.01).\n\n\nConclusion\nPatients with abnormal liver tests were at higher risk of progressing to severe disease.\n\n The detrimental effects on liver injury mainly related to certain medications used during hospitalization, which should be monitored and evaluated frequently.\n\n\nLay summary\nData on liver tests in patients with COVID-19 are scarce.\n\n We observed a high prevalence of liver test abnormalities and liver injury in 417 patients with COVID-19 admitted to our referral center, and the prevalence increased substantially during hospitalization.\n\n The presence of abnormal liver tests and liver injury were associated with the progression to severe pneumonia.\n\n The detrimental effects on liver injury were related to certain medications used during hospitalization, which warrants frequent monitoring and evaluation for these patients.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7194951","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"European Association for the Study of the Liver.

coronavirus (SARS?CoV) has been identified as the aetiological agent of SARS.\n Recently, a metallopeptidase named angiotensin?converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) has been identified as the functional receptor for SARS?CoV.\n Although ACE2 mRNA is known to be present in virtually all organs, its protein expression is largely unknown.\n Since identifying the possible route of infection has major implications for understanding the pathogenesis and future treatment strategies for SARS, the present study investigated the localization of ACE2 protein in various human organs (oral and nasal mucosa, nasopharynx, lung, stomach, small intestine, colon, skin, lymph nodes, thymus, bone marrow, spleen, liver, kidney, and brain).\n The most remarkable finding was the surface expression of ACE2 protein on lung alveolar epithelial cells and enterocytes of the small intestine.\n Furthermore, ACE2 was present in arterial and venous endothelial cells and arterial smooth muscle cells in all organs studied.\n In conclusion, ACE2 is abundantly present in humans in the epithelia of the lung and small intestine, which might provide possible routes of entry for the SARS?CoV.\n This epithelial expression, together with the presence of ACE2 in vascular endothelium, also provides a first step in understanding the pathogenesis of the main SARS disease manifestations.\n Copyright © 2004

1 week.\n\n The primary endpoint was the disappearance rate of main symptoms (fever, cough, and fatigue).\n\n\nResults\nCompared with the conventional medicine, the disappearance rate of clinical symptoms such as fever, cough, fatigue and loss of appetite in the experimental group were significantly reduced (P &lt; 0.05).\n\n The number of white blood cells and lymphocytes in the experimental group increased significantly (P &lt; 0.05), which all returned to normal parameters.\n\n Meanwhile, the C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation rate in the experimental group were significantly reduced (P &lt; 0.05).\n\n\nConclusion\nXBD combined with conventional medicine may significantly improve patient's clinical symptoms, increase the number of white blood cells and

antiviral drugs.\n Therefore, antiviral drugs should be characterized by its pro- and antioxidant activity, because it can affect its therapeutic efficiency.\n The aim of the study was to quantify the antioxidant capacity and propose the mechanism of the antioxidant effect of the antiviral drug Umifenovir (Arbidol®).\n The kinetic chemiluminescence with the 2,2’-azobis (2-amidinopropane) dihydrochloride + luminol system was used to quantify the antioxidant capacity of Umifenovir relative to the standard compound Trolox.\n With computer simulation, the reaction scheme and rate constants were proposed.\n The antioxidant capacity of 0.9 ?M Umifenovir (maximum concentration of Umifenovir in blood after oral administration of 200 mg) was as high as 1.65 ± 0.18 ?M of Trolox.\n Thus, the total antioxidant capacity of Umifenovir is comparable to the antioxidant capacity of Trolox.\n Unlike Trolox, Umifenovir reacts with free radicals in two stages.\n For Trolox, the free radical scavenging rate constant was k = 2000 nM?1 min.\n?1, for Umifenovir k1 = 300 nM?1min.\n?1, k2 = 4 nM?1min.\n?1.\n Slower kinetics of Umifenovir provides the prolonged antioxidant effect when

Chinese Medicine in the Treatment of Patients Infected with 2019-New Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2): A Review and Perspective","abstract":"Currently, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2, formerly known as 2019-nCoV, the causative pathogen of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)) has rapidly spread across China and around the world, causing an outbreak of acute infectious pneumonia.\n No specific anti-virus drugs or vaccines are available for the treatment of this sudden and lethal disease.\n The supportive care and non-specific treatment to ameliorate the symptoms of the patient are the only options currently.\n At the top of these conventional therapies, greater than 85% of SARS-CoV-2 infected patients in China are receiving Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) treatment.\n In this article, relevant published literatures are thoroughly reviewed and current applications of TCM in the treatment of COVID-19 patients are analyzed.\n Due to the homology in epidemiology, genomics, and pathogenesis of the SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV, and the widely use of TCM in the treatment of SARS-CoV, the clinical evidence showing the beneficial effect of TCM in the treatment of patients with SARS coronaviral infections are discussed.\n Current experiment studies that provide an insight into the mechanism underlying the therapeutic effect of TCM, and those studies identified novel naturally occurring compounds with anti-coronaviral activity are also introduced.\n","id":"PMC7098036","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Ivyspring International

to maladaptive cytokine release in response to infection and other stimuli.\n The pathogenesis is complex but includes loss of regulatory control of proinflammatory cytokine production, both at local and systemic levels.\n The disease progresses rapidly, and the mortality is high.\n Some evidence shows that, during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic, severe deterioration in some patients has been closely associated with dysregulated and excessive cytokine release.\n This article reviews what we know of the mechanism and treatment strategies of the COVID-19 virus-induced

By Jan 7, 2020, Chinese scientists had isolated a novel coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2; previously known as 2019-nCoV), from these patients with virus-infected pneumonia, which was later designated coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in February, 2020, by WHO. \nAlthough the outbreak is likely to have started from a zoonotic transmission event associated with a large seafood market that also traded in live wild animals, it soon became clear that efficient person-to-person transmission was also occurring. The clinical spectrum of SARS-CoV-2 infection appears to be wide, encompassing asymptomatic infection, mild upper respiratory tract illness, and severe viral pneumonia with respiratory failure and even death, with many patients being hospitalised with pneumonia in Wuhan. Although some case series have been published, many patients in these series remained hospitalised at time of publication. To our knowledge, no previous studies have been done among patients with definite outcomes. The estimation of risk factors for severe disease and death in these earlier case series are therefore not very robust. Additionally, details of the clinical and virological course of illness have not yet been well described.\nHere, we present details of all patients admitted to the two designated hospitals in Wuhan:Jinyintan Hospital and Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital:with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 and a definite clinical outcome (death or discharge) as of Jan 31, 2020. We aim to explore risk factors of in-hospital death for patients and describe the clinical course of symptoms, viral shedding, and temporal changes of laboratory findings during hospitalisation.\nResearch in context\n Evidence before this study \nWe searched PubMed on Feb 23, 2020, for articles that documented the risk factors of mortality and viral shedding in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), resulting from infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), using the search terms (&quot;novel coronavirus&quot; OR &quot;SARS-CoV-2&quot; OR &quot;COVID-19&quot;) AND (&quot;death&quot; OR &quot;mortality&quot; OR &quot;viral shedding&quot;) with no language or time restrictions. Age, comorbidities, lymphocytopenia and elevated alanine aminotransferase, d-dimer, creatine kinase, high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I, prothrombin time, and disease severity were reported to be associated with intensive care unit admission. However, no published works were found about the risk factors of mortality for adult patients with COVID-19. One study compared the sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection in throat and nasopharyngeal swab in 17 patients with COVID-19.\n Added value of this study \nIn this retrospective cohort study of adult inpatients in two hospitals in Wuhan, China, we found increasing odds of in-hospital death associated with older age (odds ratio 1 10, 95% CI 1 03-1 17; p=0 0043), higher Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score (5 65, 2 61-12 23; p&lt;0 0001), and d-dimer levels greater than 1 0 mug/mL (18 42, 2 64-128 55; p=0 0033) on admission. Duration of viral shedding ranged between 8 and 37 days. The median duration of viral shedding was 20 0 days (IQR 17 0-24 0) in survivors, but continued until death in fatal cases.\n Implications of all the available evidence \nOlder age, elevated d-dimer levels, and high SOFA score could help clinicians to identify at an early stage those patients with COVID-19 who have poor prognosis. Prolonged viral shedding provides the rationale for a strategy of isolation of infected patients and optimal antiviral interventions in the future.\nMethods\nStudy design and participants\nThis retrospective cohort study included two cohorts of adult inpatients (&gt;=18 years old) from Jinyintan Hospital and Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital (Wuhan, China). All adult patients who were diagnosed with COVID-19 according to WHO interim guidance were screened, and those who died or were discharged between Dec 29, 2019 (ie, when the first patients were admitted), and Jan 31, 2020, were included in our study. Since these two hospitals were the only designated hospitals for transfer of patients with COVID-19 from other hospitals in Wuhan until Feb 1, 2020, our study enrolled all adult inpatients who were hospitalised for COVID-19 and had a definite outcome (dead or discharged) at the early stage of the outbreak.\nBefore Jan 11, 2020, SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection results were not available in the electronic medical records, from which data for this study were obtained retrospectively; therefore, this study includes 29 of the 41 patients originally reported on. \nThe study was approved by the Research Ethics Commission of Jinyintan Hospital (KY-2020-01.01) and the requirement for informed consent was waived by the Ethics Commission as described previously. \nData collection\nEpidemiological, demographic, clinical, laboratory, treatment, and outcome data were extracted from electronic medical records using a standardised data collection form, which was a modified version of the WHO/International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium case record form for severe acute respiratory infections. All data were checked by two physicians (FZ and ZL) and a third researcher (GF) adjudicated any difference in interpretation between the two primary reviewers.\nLaboratory procedures\nMethods for laboratory confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 infection have been described elsewhere. Briefly, four institutions:the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, the Chinese Academy of Medical Science, the Academy of Military Medical Sciences, and the Wuhan Institute of Virology, Chinese Academy of Sciences:were responsible for SARS-CoV-2 detection in respiratory specimens by next-generation sequencing or real-time RT-PCR methods. From Jan 11, 2020, SARS-CoV-2 RNA were detected by local Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, local health institutions, and Jingyintan Hospital and Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital. Throat-swab specimens were obtained for SARS-CoV-2 PCR re-examination every other day after clinical remission of symptoms, including fever, cough, and dyspnoea, but only qualitative data were available. The criteria for discharge were absence of fever for at least 3 days, substantial improvement in both lungs in chest CT, clinical remission of respiratory symptoms, and two throat-swab samples negative for SARS-CoV-2 RNA obtained at least 24 h apart.\nRoutine blood examinations were complete blood count, coagulation profile, serum biochemical tests (including renal and liver function, creatine kinase, lactate dehydrogenase, and electrolytes), myocardial enzymes, interleukin-6 (IL-6), serum ferritin, and procalcitonin. Chest radiographs or CT scan were also done for all inpatients. Frequency of examinations was determined by the treating physician.\nDefinitions\nFever was defined as axillary temperature of at least 37 3 C. Sepsis and septic shock were defined according to the 2016 Third International Consensus Definition for Sepsis and Septic Shock. Secondary infection was diagnosed when patients showed clinical symptoms or signs of pneumonia or bacteraemia and a positive culture of a new pathogen was obtained from lower respiratory tract specimens (qualified sputum, endotracheal aspirate, or bronchoalveolar lavage fluid) or blood samples after admission. Ventilator-associated pneumonia was diagnosed according to the guidelines for treatment of hospital-acquired and ventilator-associated pneumonia. Acute kidney injury was diagnosed according to the KDIGO clinical practice guidelines and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) was diagnosed according to the Berlin Definition. Acute cardiac injury was diagnosed if serum levels of cardiac biomarkers (eg, high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I) were above the 99th percentile upper reference limit, or if new abnormalities were shown in electrocardiography and echocardiography. The illness severity of COVID-19 was defined according to the Chinese management guideline for COVID-19 (version 6.0). Coagulopathy was defined as a 3-second extension of prothrombin time or a 5-second extension of activated partial thromboplastin time. Hypoproteinaemia was defined as blood albumin of less than 25 g/L. Exposure history was defined as exposure to people with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection or to the Wuhan seafood market.\nStatistical analysis\nContinuous and categorical variables were presented as median (IQR) and n (%), respectively. We used the Mann-Whitney U test, chi2 test, or Fisher's exact test to compare differences between survivors and non-survivors where appropriate. To explore the risk factors associated with in-hospital death, univariable and multivariable logistic regression models were used. Considering the total number of deaths (n=54) in our study and to avoid overfitting in the model, five variables were chosen for multivariable analysis on the basis of previous findings and clinical constraints. Previous studies have shown blood levels of d-dimer and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) scores to be higher in critically ill or fatal cases, whereas lymphopenia and cardiovascular disease have been less commonly observed in non-critical or surviving patients with SARS-COV-2 infection. Similar risk factors, including older age, have been reported associated with adverse clinical outcomes in adults with SARS and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS). Some laboratory findings, including alanine aminotransferase (ALT), lactate dehydrogenase, high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I, creatine kinase, d-dimer, serum ferritin, and IL-6, might be unavailable in emergency circumstances. Therefore, we chose lymphocyte count, d-dimer, SOFA score, coronary heart disease, and age as the five variables for our multivariable logistic regression model.\nWe excluded variables from the univariable analysis if their between-group differences were not significant, if their accuracy was unconfirmed (eg, exposure, which was self-reported), if the number of events was too small to calculate odds ratios, and if they had colinearity with the SOFA score.\nWe compared patient characteristics between the two hospitals and used a generalised linear model to adjust for possible differences in patients' characteristics and treatment between the two study centres.\nA two-sided alpha of less than 0 05 was considered statistically significant. Statistical analyses were done using the SAS software (version 9.4), unless otherwise indicated.\nRole of the funding source\nThe funder of the study had no role in study design, data collection, data analysis, data interpretation, or writing of the report. The corresponding authors (BC and HC) had full access to all the data in the study and had final responsibility for the decision to submit for publication.\nResults\nDemographic, clinical, laboratory, and radiographic findings of patients on admission\n		Total (n=191)	Non-survivor (n=54)	Survivor (n=137)	p value	 	Demographics and clinical characteristics	 	Age, years	56 0 (46 0-67 0)	69 0 (63 0-76 0)	52 0 (45 0-58 0)	&lt;0 0001	 	Sex	..	..	..	0 15	 		Female	72 (38%)	16 (30%)	56 (41%)	..

After excluding 613 patients that were still hospitalised or not confirmed by SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection as of Jan 31, 2020, and nine inpatients without available key information in their medical records, we included 191 inpatients (135 from Jinyintan Hospital and 56 from Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital) in the final analysis. 54 patients died during hospitalisation and 137 were discharged. The median age of the 191 patients was 56 0 years (IQR 46 0-67 0), ranging from 18 years to 87 years, and most patients were male (table 1 ). Comorbidities were present in nearly half of patients, with hypertension being the most common comorbidity, followed by diabetes and coronary heart disease (table 1). The most common symptoms on admission were fever and cough, followed by sputum production and fatigue (table 1). Lymphocytopenia occurred in 77 (40%) patients. 181 (95%) patients received antibiotics and 41 (21%) received antivirals (lopinavir/ritonavir; table 2 ). Systematic corticosteroid and intravenous immunoglobulin use differed significantly between non-survivors and survivors (table 2). The comparison of characteristics, treatment, and outcomes of patients from the two hospitals are shown in the appendix (pp 2-4).\nThe median time from illness onset (ie, before admission) to discharge was 22 0 days (IQR 18 0-25 0), whereas the median time to death was 18 5 days (15 0-22 0; table 2). 32 patients required invasive mechanical ventilation, of whom 31 (97%) died. The median time from illness onset to invasive mechanical ventilation was 14 5 days (12 0-19 0). Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation was used in three patients, none of whom survived. Sepsis was the most frequently observed complication, followed by respiratory failure, ARDS, heart failure, and septic shock (table 2). Half of non-survivors experienced a secondary infection, and ventilator-associated pneumonia occurred in ten (31%) of 32 patients requiring invasive mechanical ventilation. The frequency of complications were higher in non-survivors than survivors (table 2).\nRisk factors associated with in-hospital death\n		Univariable OR (95% CI)	p value	Multivariable OR (95% CI)	p value	 	Demographics and clinical characteristics	 	Age, years*	1 14 (1 09-1 18)	&lt;0 0001	1 10 (1 03-1 17)	0 0043	 	Female sex (vs male)	0 61 (0 31-1 20)	0 15	..	..

IL-6=interleukin-6.\nPer 1 unit increase.\nIn univariable analysis, odds of in-hospital death was higher in patients with diabetes or coronary heart disease (table 3 ). Age, lymphopenia, leucocytosis, and elevated ALT, lactate dehydrogenase, high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I, creatine kinase, d-dimer, serum ferritin, IL-6, prothrombin time, creatinine, and procalcitonin were also associated with death (table 3).\nWe included 171 patients with complete data for all variables (53 non-survivors and 118 survivors) in the multivariable logistic regression model. We found that older age, higher SOFA score, and d-dimer greater than 1 mug/mL at admission were associated with increased odds of death (table 3). When adjusting for study centre, our generalised linear model showed similar results (appendix p 5).\nClinical courses of major symptoms and outcomes and duration of viral shedding from illness onset in patients hospitalised with COVID-19\nFigure shows median duration of symptoms and onset of complications and outcomes. ICU=intensive care unit. SARS-CoV-2=severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. ARDS=acute respiratory distress syndrome. COVID-19=coronavirus disease 2019.\nFor survivors, the median duration of viral shedding was 20 0 days (IQR 17 0-24 0) from illness onset, but the virus was continuously detectable until death in non-survivors (table 2; figure 1 ). The shortest observed duration of viral shedding among survivors was 8 days, whereas the longest was 37 days. Among 29 patients who received lopinavir/ritonavir and were discharged, the median time from illness onset to initiation of antiviral treatment was 14 0 days (IQR 10 0-17 0) and the median duration of viral shedding was 22 0 days (18 0-24 0). The median duration of viral shedding was 19 0 days (17 0-22 0) in patients with severe disease status and 24 0 days (22 0-30 0) in patients with critical disease status.\nTemporal changes in laboratory markers from illness onset in patients hospitalised with COVID-19\nFigure shows temporal changes in d-dimer (A), lymphocytes (B), IL-6 (C), serum ferritin (D), high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I (E), and lactate dehydrogenase (F). Differences between survivors and non-survivors were significant for all timepoints shown, except for day 4 after illness onset for d-dimer, IL-6, and high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I. For serum ferritin (D), the median values after day 16 exceeded the upper limit of detection, as indicated by the dashed line. COVID-19=coronavirus disease 2019. IL-6=interleukin-6.\nMajor laboratory markers were tracked from illness onset (figure 2 ). Baseline lymphocyte count was significantly higher in survivors than non-survivors; in survivors, lymphocyte count was lowest on day 7 after illness onset and improved during hospitalisation, whereas severe lymphopenia was observed until death in non-survivors. Levels of d-dimer, high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I, serum ferritin, lactate dehydrogenase, and IL-6 were clearly elevated in non-survivors compared with survivors throughout the clinical course, and increased with illness deterioration (figure 2). In non-survivors, high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I increased rapidly from day 16 after disease onset, whereas lactate dehydrogenase increased for both survivors and non-survivors in the early stage of illness, but decreased from day 13 for survivors.\nMedian time from illness onset to dyspnoea was similar in survivors and non-survivors, with a median duration of dyspnoea of 13 0 days (9 0-16 5) for survivors (table 2; figure 1). In survivors, the median duration of fever was 12 0 days (8 0-13 0) and cough persisted for 19 0 days (IQR 12 0-23 0; figure 1). 62 (45%) survivors still had cough on discharge and 39 (72%) non-survivors still had cough at the time of death. The dynamic profiles of fever, cough, and dyspnoea are shown in the appendix (p 6). Sepsis developed at a median of 9 0 days (7 0-13 0) after illness onset among all patients, followed by ARDS (12 0 days [8 0-15 0]), acute cardiac injury (15 0 days [10 0-17 0]), acute kidney injury (15 0 days [13 0-19 5]), and secondary infection (17 0 days [13 0-19 0]). The initiation time and duration of systematic corticosteroid use was also similar between the two groups. Among non-survivors, the median time from illness onset was 10 0 days (7 0-14 0) to sepsis, 12 0 days (8 0-15 0) to ARDS, 14 5 days (9 5-17 0) to acute cardiac injury, and 17 0 days (13 0-19 0) to secondary infection (figure 1; table 2). Among survivors, secondary infection, acute kidney injury, and acute cardiac injury were observed in one patient each, occurring 9 days (acute kidney injury), 14 days (secondary infection), and 21 days (acute cardiac injury) after illness onset.\nThe median time from dyspnoea to intubation was 10 0 days (IQR 5 0-12 5) for patients who received invasive mechanical ventilation and the time from invasive mechanical ventilation to occurrence of ventilator-associated pneumonia was 8 0 days (2 0-9 0; figure 1).\nDiscussion\nThis retrospective cohort study identified several risk factors for death in adults in Wuhan who were hospitalised with COVID-19. In particular, older age, d-dimer levels greater than 1 mug/mL, and higher SOFA score on admission were associated with higher odds of in-hospital death. Additionally, elevated levels of blood IL-6, high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I, and lactate dehydrogenase and lymphopenia were more commonly seen in severe COVID-19 illness. Sustained viral detection in throat samples was observed in both survivors and non-survivors.\nPreviously, older age has been reported as an important independent predictor of mortality in SARS and MERS. The current study confirmed that increased age was associated with death in patients with COVID-19. Previous studies in macaques inoculated with SARS-CoV found that older macaques had stronger host innate responses to virus infection than younger adults, with an increase in differential expression of genes associated with inflammation, whereas expression of type I interferon beta was reduced. The age-dependent defects in T-cell and B-cell function and the excess production of type 2 cytokines could lead to a deficiency in control of viral replication and more prolonged proinflammatory responses, potentially leading to poor outcome. \nSOFA score is a good diagnostic marker for sepsis and septic shock, and reflects the state and degree of multi-organ dysfunction. Although bacterial infections are usually regarded as a leading cause of sepsis, viral infection can also cause sepsis syndrome. Previously, we determined that sepsis occurred in nearly 40% of adults with community-acquired pneumonia due to viral infection. In the current study, we found that more than half of patients developed sepsis. Additionally, we found that more than 70% of patients had white blood cell count below 10 0 x 109 per L or procalcitonin below 0 25 ng/mL, and no bacterial pathogens were detected in these patients on admission. Sepsis was a common complication, which might be directly caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection, but further research is needed to investigate the pathogenesis of sepsis in COVID-19 illness.\nCardiac complications, including new or worsening heart failure, new or worsening arrhythmia, or myocardial infarction are common in patients with pneumonia. Cardiac arrest occurs in about 3% of inpatients with pneumonia. Risk factors of cardiac events after pneumonia include older age, pre-existing cardiovascular diseases, and greater severity of pneumonia at presentation. Coronary heart disease has also been found to be associated with acute cardiac events and poor outcomes in influenza and other respiratory viral infections. In this study, increased high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I during hospitalisation was found in more than half of those who died. The first autopsy of a 53-year-old woman with chronic renal failure in Jinyintan Hospital showed acute myocardial infarction (data not published; personal communication with a pathologist from the Chinese Academy of Science). About 90% of inpatients with pneumonia had increased coagulation activity, marked by increased d-dimer concentrations. In this study, we found d-dimer greater than 1 mug/mL is associated with fatal outcome of COVID-19. High levels of d-dimer have a reported association with 28-day mortality in patients with infection or sepsis identified in the emergency department. Contributory mechanisms include systemic pro-inflammatory cytokine responses that are mediators of atherosclerosis directly contributing to plaque rupture through local inflammation, induction of procoagulant factors, and haemodynamic changes, which predispose to ischaemia and thrombosis. In addition, angiotensin converting enzyme 2, the receptor for SARS-CoV-2, is expressed on myocytes and vascular endothelial cells, so there is at least theoretical potential possibility of direct cardiac involvement by the virus. Of note, interstitial mononuclear inflammatory infiltrates in heart tissue has been documented in fatal cases of COVID-19, although viral detection studies were not reported. \nThe level and duration of infectious virus replication are important factors in assessing the risk of transmission and guiding decisions regarding isolation of patients. Because coronavirus RNA detection is more sensitive than virus isolation, most studies have used qualitative or quantitative viral RNA tests as a potential marker for infectious coronavirus. For SARS-CoV, viral RNA was detected in respiratory specimens from about a third of patients as long as 4 weeks after disease onset. Similarly, the duration of MERS-CoV RNA detection in lower respiratory specimans persisted for at least 3 weeks, whereas the duration of SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection has not been well characterised. In the current study, we found that the detectable SARS-CoV-2 RNA persisted for a median of 20 days in survivors and that it was sustained until death in non-survivors. This has important implications for both patient isolation decision making and guidance around the length of antiviral treatment. In severe influenza virus infection, prolonged viral shedding was associated with fatal outcome and delayed antiviral treatment was an independent risk factor for prolonged virus detection. Similarly, effective antiviral treatment might improve outcomes in COVID-19, although we did not observe shortening of viral shedding duration after lopinavir/ritonavir treatment in the current study. Randomised clinical trials for lopinavir/ritonavir (ChiCTR2000029308) and intravenous remdesivir (NCT04257656, NCT04252664) in treatment of COVID-19 are currently in progress.\nOur study has some limitations. First, due to the retrospective study design, not all laboratory tests were done in all patients, including lactate dehydrogenase, IL-6, and serum ferritin. Therefore, their role might be underestimated in predicting in-hospital death. Second, patients were sometimes transferred late in their illness to the two included hospitals. Lack of effective antivirals, inadequate adherence to standard supportive therapy, and high-dose corticosteroid use might have also contributed to the poor clinical outcomes in some patients. Third, the estimated duration of viral shedding is limited by the frequency of respiratory specimen collection, lack of quantitative viral RNA detection, and relatively low positive rate of SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection in throat-swabs. Fourth, by excluding patients still in hospital as of Jan 31, 2020, and thus relatively more severe disease at an earlier stage, the case fatality ratio in our study cannot reflect the true mortality of COVID-19. Last but not least, interpretation of our findings might be limited by the sample size. However, by including all adult patients in the two designated hospitals for COVID-19, we believe our study population is representative of cases diagnosed and treated in Wuhan.\nTo the best of our knowledge, this is the largest retrospective cohort study among patients with COVID-19 who have experienced a definite outcome. We found that older age, higher SOFA score, and elevated d-dimer at admission were risk factors for death of adult patients with COVID-19. The prolonged viral shedding provides the rationale for testing novel coronavirus antiviral interventions in efforts to improve outcomes.\n This online publication has been corrected.

associated with a novel coronavirus was reported in Wuhan city, Hubei province, China.\n\n Affected patients were geographically linked with a local wet market as a potential source.\n\n No data on

five patients in a family cluster who presented with unexplained pneumonia after returning to Shenzhen, Guangdong province, China, after a visit to Wuhan, and an additional family member who did not travel to Wuhan.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of genetic sequences from these patients were done.\n\n\nFindings\nFrom Jan 10, 2020, we enrolled a family of six patients who travelled to Wuhan from Shenzhen between Dec 29, 2019 and Jan 4, 2020. Of six family members who travelled to Wuhan, five were identified as infected with the novel coronavirus.\n\n Additionally, one family member, who did not travel to Wuhan, became infected with the virus after several days of contact with four of the family members.\n\n None of the family members had contacts with Wuhan markets or animals, although two had visited a Wuhan hospital.\n\n Five family members (aged 36–66 years) presented with fever, upper or lower respiratory tract symptoms, or diarrhoea, or a combination of these 3–6 days after exposure.\n\n They presented to our hospital (The University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen) 6–10 days after symptom onset.\n\n They and one asymptomatic child (aged 10 years) had radiological ground-glass lung opacities.\n\n Older patients (aged &gt;60 years) had more systemic symptoms, extensive radiological ground-glass lung changes, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and increased C-reactive protein and lactate dehydrogenase levels.\n\n The nasopharyngeal or throat swabs of these six patients were negative for known respiratory microbes by point-of-care multiplex RT-PCR, but five patients (four adults and the child) were RT-PCR positive for genes encoding the internal RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and surface Spike protein of this novel coronavirus, which were confirmed by Sanger sequencing.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these five patients' RT-PCR amplicons and two full genomes by next-generation sequencing showed that this is a novel coronavirus, which is closest to the bat severe acute respiatory syndrome (SARS)-related coronaviruses found in Chinese horseshoe bats.\n\n\nInterpretation\nOur findings are consistent with person-to-person transmission of this novel coronavirus in hospital and family settings, and the reports of infected travellers in other geographical regions.\n\n\nFunding\nThe Shaw Foundation Hong Kong, Michael Seak-Kan Tong, Respiratory Viral Research Foundation Limited, Hui

January 2020. We analyzed data on the first 425 confirmed cases in Wuhan to determine the epidemiologic characteristics of NCIP.\n\n\nMethods\nWe collected information on demographic characteristics, exposure history, and illness timelines of laboratory-confirmed cases of NCIP that had been reported by January 22, 2020. We described characteristics of the cases and estimated the key epidemiologic time-delay distributions.\n\n In the early period of exponential growth, we estimated the epidemic doubling time and the basic reproductive number.\n\n\nResults\nAmong the first 425 patients with confirmed NCIP, the median age was 59 years and 56% were male.\n\n The majority of cases (55%) with onset before January 1, 2020, were linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, as compared with 8.6% of the subsequent cases.\n\n The mean incubation period was 5.2 days (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.1 to 7.0), with the 95th percentile of the distribution at 12.5 days.\n\n In its early stages, the epidemic doubled in size every 7.4 days.\n\n With a mean serial interval of 7.5 days (95% CI, 5.3 to 19), the basic reproductive number was estimated to be 2.2 (95% CI, 1.4 to 3.9).\n\n\nConclusions\nOn the basis of this information, there is evidence that human-to-human transmission has occurred among close contacts since the middle of December 2019.

outcomes in patients with a number of different malignancies.\n\n The objective of this study was to assess the relationship between NLR and mortality in a population of adult critically ill patients.\n\n\nMethods\nWe performed an observational cohort study of unselected intensive care unit (ICU) patients based on records in a large clinical database.\n\n We computed individual patient NLR and categorized patients by quartile of this ratio.\n\n The association of NLR quartiles and 28-day mortality was assessed using multivariable logistic regression.\n\n Secondary outcomes included mortality in the ICU, in-hospital mortality and 1-year mortality.\n\n An a priori subgroup analysis of patients with versus without sepsis was performed to assess any differences in the relationship between the NLR and outcomes in these cohorts.\n\n\nResults\nA total of 5,056 patients were included.\n\n Their 28-day mortality rate was 19%.\n\n The median age of the cohort was 65 years, and 47% were female.\n\n The median NLR for the entire cohort was 8.9 (interquartile range, 4.99 to 16.21).\n\n Following multivariable adjustments, there was a stepwise increase in mortality with increasing quartiles of NLR (first quartile: reference category; second quartile odds ratio (OR) = 1.32; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.03 to 1.71; third quartile OR = 1.43; 95% CI, 1.12 to 1.83; 4th quartile OR = 1.71; 95% CI, 1.35 to 2.16).\n\n A similar stepwise relationship was identified in the subgroup of patients who presented without sepsis.\n\n The NLR was not associated with 28-day mortality in patients with sepsis.\n\n Increasing quartile of NLR was statistically significantly associated with secondary outcome.\n\n\nConclusion\nThe NLR is associated with outcomes in unselected critically ill patients.\n\n In patients with sepsis, there was no statistically significant relationship between NLR and mortality.\n\n Further investigation is required to increase understanding of the pathophysiology of this relationship and to validate these findings with data collected prospectively.\n\n\nElectronic supplementary material\nThe online version of this article

recently reported in Wuhan, Hubei province, China.\n As of 25 January 2020, at least 1,975 cases had been reported since the first patient was hospitalized on 12 December 2019. Epidemiological investigations have suggested that the outbreak was associated with a seafood market in Wuhan.\n Here we study a single patient who was a worker at the market and who was admitted to the Central Hospital of Wuhan on 26 December 2019 while experiencing a severe respiratory syndrome that included fever, dizziness and a cough.\n Metagenomic RNA sequencing4 of a sample of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from the patient identified a new RNA virus strain from the family Coronaviridae, which is designated here ‘WH-Human 1’ coronavirus (and has also been referred to as ‘2019-nCoV’).\n Phylogenetic analysis of the complete viral genome (29,903 nucleotides) revealed that the virus was most closely related (89.1% nucleotide similarity) to a group of SARS-like

the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatment and clinical outcomes of these patients.\n\n\nMethods\nAll patients with suspected 2019-nCoV were admitted to a designated hospital in Wuhan.\n\n We prospectively collected and analysed data on patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection by real-time RT-PCR and next-generation sequencing.\n\n Data were obtained with standardised data collection forms shared by WHO and the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium from electronic medical records.\n\n Researchers also directly communicated with patients or their families to ascertain epidemiological and symptom data.\n\n Outcomes were also compared between patients who had been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and those who had not.\n\n\nFindings\nBy Jan 2, 2020, 41 admitted hospital patients had been identified as having laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection.\n\n Most of the infected patients were men (30 [73%] of 41); less than half had underlying diseases (13 [32%]), including diabetes (eight [20%]), hypertension (six [15%]), and cardiovascular disease (six [15%]).\n\n Median age was 49·0 years (IQR 41·0–58·0).\n\n 27 (66%) of 41 patients had been exposed to Huanan seafood market.\n\n One family cluster was found.\n\n Common symptoms at onset of illness were fever (40 [98%] of 41 patients), cough (31 [76%]), and myalgia or fatigue (18 [44%]); less common symptoms were sputum production (11 [28%] of 39), headache (three [8%] of 38), haemoptysis (two [5%] of 39), and diarrhoea (one [3%] of 38).\n\n Dyspnoea developed in 22 (55%) of 40 patients (median time from illness onset to dyspnoea 8·0 days [IQR 5·0–13·0]).\n\n 26 (63%) of 41 patients had lymphopenia.\n\n All 41 patients had pneumonia with abnormal findings on chest CT.\n\n Complications included acute respiratory distress syndrome (12 [29%]), RNAaemia (six [15%]), acute cardiac injury (five [12%]) and secondary infection (four [10%]).\n\n 13 (32%) patients were admitted to an ICU and six (15%) died.\n\n Compared with non-ICU patients, ICU patients had higher plasma levels of IL2, IL7, IL10, GSCF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNF?.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe 2019-nCoV infection caused clusters of severe respiratory illness similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and was associated with

Demographic data, symptoms, laboratory values, comorbidities, treatments, and clinical outcomes were all collected.\n\n Data were compared between survivors and non-survivors.\n\n The primary outcome was 28-day mortality, as of Feb 9, 2020. Secondary outcomes included incidence of SARS-CoV-2-related acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and the proportion of patients requiring mechanical ventilation.\n\n\nFindings\nOf 710 patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, 52 critically ill adult patients were included.\n\n The mean age of the 52 patients was 59·7 (SD 13·3) years, 35 (67%) were men, 21 (40%) had chronic illness, 51 (98%) had fever.\n\n 32 (61·5%) patients had died at 28 days, and the median duration from admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) to death was 7 (IQR 3–11) days for non-survivors.\n\n Compared with survivors, non-survivors were older (64·6 years [11·2] vs 51·9 years [12·9]), more likely to develop ARDS (26 [81%] patients vs 9 [45%] patients), and more likely to receive mechanical ventilation (30 [94%] patients vs 7 [35%] patients), either invasively or non-invasively.\n\n Most patients had organ function damage, including 35 (67%) with ARDS, 15 (29%) with acute kidney injury, 12 (23%) with cardiac injury, 15 (29%) with liver dysfunction, and one (2%) with pneumothorax.\n\n 37 (71%) patients required mechanical ventilation.\n\n Hospital-acquired infection occurred in seven (13·5%) patients.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe mortality of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia is considerable.\n\n The survival time of the non-survivors is likely to be within 1–2 weeks after ICU admission.\n\n Older patients (&gt;65 years) with comorbidities and ARDS are at increased risk of death.\n\n The severity of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia poses great strain on critical care resources in hospitals, especially if they are not adequately staffed or resourced.\n\n\nFunding\nNone.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7102538","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Elsevier

chemokines are considered pro-inflammatory, and their release can be induced during an immune response at a site of infection, while others are considered homeostatic and are involved in controlling of cells migration during tissue development or maintenance.\n The physiologic importance of this family of mediators is resulting from their specificity ? members of the chemokine family induce recruitment of well-defined leukocyte subsets.\n There are two major chemokine sub-families based upon cysteine residues position: CXC and CC.\n As a general rule, members of the CXC chemokines are chemotactic for neutrophils, and CC chemokines are chemotactic for monocytes and sub-set of lymphocytes, although there are some exceptions.\n This review discusses the potential role of chemokines in

We report detailed clinical and virological data for two related cases of MERS-CoV disease, after nosocomial transmission of the virus from one patient to another in a French hospital.\n\n\nMethods\nPatient 1 visited Dubai in April, 2013; patient 2 lives in France and did not travel abroad.\n\n Both patients had underlying immunosuppressive disorders.\n\n We tested specimens from the upper (nasopharyngeal swabs) or the lower (bronchoalveolar lavage, sputum) respiratory tract and whole blood, plasma, and serum specimens for MERS-CoV by real-time RT-PCR targeting the upE and Orf1A genes of MERS-CoV.\n\n\nFindings\nInitial clinical presentation included fever, chills, and myalgia in both patients, and for patient 1, diarrhoea.\n\n Respiratory symptoms rapidly became predominant with acute respiratory failure leading to mechanical ventilation and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO).\n\n Both patients developed acute renal failure.\n\n MERS-CoV was detected in lower respiratory tract specimens with high viral load (eg, cycle threshold [Ct] values of 22·9 for upE and 24 for Orf1a for a bronchoalveolar lavage sample from patient 1; Ct values of 22·5 for upE and 23·9 for Orf1a for an induced sputum sample from patient 2), whereas nasopharyngeal specimens were weakly positive or inconclusive.\n\n The two patients shared the same room for 3 days.\n\n The incubation period was estimated at 9–12 days for the second case.\n\n No secondary transmission was documented in hospital staff despite the absence of specific protective measures before the diagnosis of MERS-CoV was suspected.\n\n Patient 1 died on May 28, due to refractory multiple organ failure.\n\n\nInterpretation\nPatients with respiratory symptoms returning from the

host cells","abstract":"id='Par1'>In face of the everlasting battle toward COVID-19 and the rapid evolution of SARS-CoV-2, no specific and effective drugs for treating this disease have been reported until today.\n Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), a receptor of SARS-CoV-2, mediates the virus infection by binding to spike protein.\n Although ACE2 is expressed in the lung, kidney, and intestine, its expressing levels are rather low, especially in the lung.\n Considering the great infectivity of COVID-19, we speculate that SARS-CoV-2 may depend on other routes to facilitate its infection.\n Here, we first discover an interaction between host cell receptor CD147 and SARS-CoV-2 spike protein.\n The loss of CD147 or blocking CD147 in Vero E6 and BEAS-2B cell lines by anti-CD147 antibody, Meplazumab, inhibits SARS-CoV-2 amplification.\n Expression of human CD147 allows virus entry into non-susceptible BHK-21 cells, which can be neutralized by CD147 extracellular fragment.\n Viral loads are detectable in the lungs of human CD147 (hCD147) mice infected with SARS-CoV-2, but not in those of virus-infected wild type mice.\n Interestingly, virions are observed in lymphocytes of lung tissue from a COVID-19 patient.\n Human T cells with a property of ACE2 natural deficiency can be infected with SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus in a dose-dependent manner, which is specifically inhibited by Meplazumab.\n Furthermore, CD147 mediates virus entering host cells by endocytosis.\n Together, our study reveals a novel virus entry route, CD147-spike protein, which provides an important target for developing specific and effective drug against COVID-19.","id":"PMC7714896","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Nature Publishing Group

Meta-Analysis of Randomized Controlled Trials","abstract":"\nWhat Is Known and Objective.\n To reevaluate the benefits and risks of corticosteroid treatment in adult patients with septic shock.\n Methods.\n This study was performed based on PRISMA guidelines.\n Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of corticosteroids versus placebo were retrieved from PubMed, MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Science, the Cochrane Central RCTs, and ClinicalTrials.\ngov from January 1980 to April 2018. We also conducted a trial sequential analysis to indicate the possibility of type I or II errors and calculate the information size.\n Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation approach (GRADE) was applying to assess the certainty of evidence at the primary outcome level.\n Results.\n Twenty-one RCTs were identified and analyzed.\n Patients treated with corticosteroid had a 7% reduction in relative risk in 28-day all-cause mortality compared to controls (RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.88 to 0.99).\n However, there were no significant differences for the intensive care unit (ICU) mortality (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.09) or in-hospital mortality (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.11).\n Corticosteroids shortened the length of ICU stay by 1.04 days (RR -1.04, 95% CI -1.72 to -0.36) and the length of hospital stay by 2.49 days (RR -2.49, 95% CI -4.96 to -0.02).\n Corticosteroids increased the risk of hyperglycemia (RR 1.11, 95% CI 1.06 to 1.16) but not gastroduodenal bleeding (RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.37) or superinfection (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.15).\n However, some date on secondary outcomes were unavailable because they were not measured or not reported in the included studies which may cause a lack of power or selective outcome reporting.\n The information size was calculated at 10044 patients.\n Trial sequential analysis showed that the meta-analysis was conclusive and the risk of type 2 error was minimal.\n What Is New and Conclusion.\n Corticosteroids are likely to be effective in reducing 28-day mortality and attenuating septic shock without increasing the rate of life-threatening complications.\n TSA showed that the risk of type II error in this meta-analysis was minimal and the result was conclusive.\n","id":"PMC6590573","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Hindawi","authors":[{"firstname":"X.-J.","surname":"Lian","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"D.-Z.","surname":"Huang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Y.-S.","surname":"Cao","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Y.-X.","surname":"Wei","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Z.-Z.","surname":"Lian","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"T.-H.","surname":"Qin","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"P.-C.","surname":"He","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Y.-H.","surname":"Liu","email":"lyh0718@126.com","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"S.-H.","surname":"Wang","email":"wshdoctor@139.com","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"S.-H.","surname":"Wang","email":"wshdoctor@139.com","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1016/j.ajem.2018.11.040","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Can corticosteroids reduce the mortality of patients with severe sepsis?

of treatment selection, conditional on observed baseline covariates.\n Weighting subjects by the inverse probability of treatment received creates a synthetic sample in which treatment assignment is independent of measured baseline covariates.\n Inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) using the propensity score allows one to obtain unbiased estimates of average treatment effects.\n However, these estimates are only valid if there are no residual systematic differences in observed baseline characteristics between treated and control subjects in the sample weighted by the estimated inverse probability of treatment.\n We report on a systematic literature review, in which we found that the use of IPTW has increased rapidly in recent years, but that in the most recent year, a majority of studies did not formally examine whether weighting balanced measured covariates between treatment groups.\n We then proceed to describe a suite of quantitative and qualitative methods that allow one to assess whether measured baseline covariates are balanced between treatment groups in the weighted sample.\n The quantitative methods use the weighted standardized difference to compare means, prevalences, higher?order moments, and interactions.\n The qualitative methods employ graphical methods to compare the distribution of continuous baseline covariates between treated and control subjects in the weighted sample.\n Finally, we illustrate the application of these methods in an empirical case study.\n We propose a formal set of balance diagnostics that contribute towards an evolving concept of ‘best practice’ when using IPTW to estimate causal treatment effects using observational data.\n © 2015 The Authors.\n Statistics in Medicine Published by John Wiley

with survival analysis","abstract":"id='sim7084-para-0001'>Propensity score methods are used to reduce the effects of observed confounding when using observational data to estimate the effects of treatments or exposures.\n A popular method of using the propensity score is inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW).\n When using this method, a weight is calculated for each subject that is equal to the inverse of the probability of receiving the treatment that was actually received.\n These weights are then incorporated into the analyses to minimize the effects of observed confounding.\n Previous research has found that these methods result in unbiased estimation when estimating the effect of treatment on survival outcomes.\n However, conventional methods of variance estimation were shown to result in biased estimates of standard error.\n In this study, we conducted an extensive set of Monte Carlo simulations to examine different methods of variance estimation when using a weighted Cox proportional hazards model to estimate the effect of treatment.\n We considered three variance estimation methods: (i) a naïve model?based variance estimator; (ii) a robust sandwich?type variance estimator; and (iii) a bootstrap variance estimator.\n We considered estimation of both the average treatment effect and the average treatment effect in the treated.\n We found that the use of a bootstrap estimator resulted in approximately correct estimates of standard errors and confidence intervals with the correct coverage rates.\n The other estimators resulted in biased estimates of standard errors and confidence intervals with incorrect coverage rates.\n Our simulations were informed by a case study examining the effect of statin prescribing on mortality.\n © 2016

as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Zika virus disease, present a major threat to public health1–3.\n Despite intense research efforts, how, when and where new diseases appear are still a source of considerable uncertainty.\n A severe respiratory disease was recently reported in Wuhan, Hubei province, China.\n As of 25 January 2020, at least 1,975 cases had been reported since the first patient was hospitalized on 12 December 2019. Epidemiological investigations have suggested that the outbreak was associated with a seafood market in Wuhan.\n Here we study a single patient who was a worker at the market and who was admitted to the Central Hospital of Wuhan on 26 December 2019 while experiencing a severe respiratory syndrome that included fever, dizziness and a cough.\n Metagenomic RNA sequencing4 of a sample of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from the patient identified a new RNA virus strain from the family Coronaviridae, which is designated here ‘WH-Human 1’ coronavirus (and has also been referred to as ‘2019-nCoV’).\n Phylogenetic analysis of the complete viral genome (29,903 nucleotides) revealed that the virus was most closely related (89.1% nucleotide similarity) to a group of SARS-like coronaviruses (genus Betacoronavirus, subgenus Sarbecovirus) that had previously been found in bats in China5.\n This outbreak highlights the ongoing ability of viral spill-over from animals to cause severe disease in humans.\n","id":"PMC7094943","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Nature Publishing Group UK","authors":[{"firstname":"Fan","surname":"Wu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Su","surname":"Zhao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Bin","surname":"Yu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yan-Mei","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Wen","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhi-Gang","surname":"Song","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yi","surname":"Hu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhao-Wu","surname":"Tao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhao-Wu","surname":"Tao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jun-Hua","surname":"Tian","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yuan-Yuan","surname":"Pei","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ming-Li","surname":"Yuan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yu-Ling","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Fa-Hui","surname":"Dai","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yi","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Qi-Min","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jiao-Jiao","surname":"Zheng","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lin","surname":"Xu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Edward C.","surname":"Holmes","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yong-Zhen","surname":"Zhang","email":"zhangyongzhen@shphc.org.cn","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yong-Zhen","surname":"Zhang","email":"zhangyongzhen@shphc.org.cn","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Clinical features of patients infected with 2019 novel coronavirus in Wuhan, China","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"A familial cluster of pneumonia associated with the 2019 novel coronavirus indicating person-to-person transmission: a study of a family cluster","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"The clinical pathology of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS): a report from China","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Clinicopathologic, immunohistochemical, and ultrastructural findings of a fatal case of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus infection in the United Arab Emirates, April 2014","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]}]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Persistent shedding of viable SARS-CoV in urine and stool of SARS patients during the convalescent phase","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[],"References depth 2":[{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"World Health Organization (2004) Summary of probable SARS with onset of illness from 1 November 2002 to 31 July 2003.

defined the clinical presentation and risk factors associated with severe disease and investigated the causal agents by chest radiography and laboratory testing of nasopharyngeal aspirates and sera

from 23 to 74 years.\n\n Fever, chills, myalgia, and cough were the most frequent complaints.\n\n When compared with chest radiographic changes, respiratory symptoms and auscultatory findings were disproportionally mild.\n\n Patients who were household contacts of other infected people and had older age, lymphopenia, and liver dysfunction were associated with severe disease.\n\n A virus

changes in a community outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS).\n\n\nMethods\nWe followed up 75 patients for 3 weeks managed with a standard treatment protocol of ribavirin and corticosteroids, and assessed the pattern of clinical disease, viral load, risk factors for poor clinical outcome, and the usefulness of virological diagnostic methods.\n\n\nFindings\nFever and pneumonia initially improved but 64 (85%) patients developed recurrent fever after a mean of 8.9 (SD 3.1) days, 55 (73%) had watery diarrhoea after 7.5 (2.3) days, 60 (80%) had radiological worsening after 7.4 (2.2) days, and respiratory symptoms worsened in 34 (45%) after 8.6 (3.0) days.\n\n In 34 (45%) patients, improvement of initial pulmonary lesions was associated with appearance of new radiological lesions at other sites.\n\n Nine (12%) patients developed spontaneous pneumomediastinum and 15 (20%) developed acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in week 3. Quantitative reverse-transcriptase (RT) PCR of nasopharyngeal aspirates in 14 patients (four with ARDS) showed peak viral load at day 10, and at day 15 a load lower than at admission.\n\n Age and chronic hepatitis B virus infection treated with lamivudine were independent significant risk factors for progression to ARDS (p=0.001).\n\n SARS-associated coronavirus in faeces was seen on RT-PCR in 65 (97%) of 67 patients at day 14. The mean time to seroconversion was 20 days.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe consistent clinical progression, shifting radiological infiltrates, and an inverted V viral-load profile suggest that worsening in week 2 is unrelated to uncontrolled viral replication but may be related to immunopathological damage.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7112410","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Elsevier Ltd.","authors":[{"firstname":"JSM","surname":"Peiris","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"CM","surname":"Chu","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"VCC","surname":"Cheng","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"KS","surname":"Chan","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"IFN","surname":"Hung","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"LLM","surname":"Poon","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"KI","surname":"Law","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"BSF","surname":"Tang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"TYW","surname":"Hon","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"CS","surname":"Chan","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"KH","surname":"Chan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"JSC","surname":"Ng","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"BJ","surname":"Zheng","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"WL","surname":"Ng","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"RWM","surname":"Lai","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Y","surname":"Guan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"KY","surname":"Yuen","email":"kyyuen@hkucc.hku.hk","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"NULL","surname":"NULL","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Profile of specific antibodies to the SARS-associated coronavirus","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Serology of severe acute respiratory syndrome: implications for surveillance and outcome","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"SARS-CoV antibody prevalence in all Hong Kong patient contacts","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Early diagnosis of SARS coronavirus infection by real time RT-PCR","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Detection of SARS coronavirus in patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome by conventional and real-time quantitative reverse transcription-PCR assays","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Detection of SARS coronavirus in patients with suspected SARS","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Preclinical evaluation of two real-time, reverse transcription-PCR assays for detection of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"World Health Organization (2003) PCR primers for SARS developed by WHO network laboratories [monograph on the Internet].

We aimed to describe the clinical features, treatment, and outcomes of patients with COVID-19 admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) in Guangdong Province.\nMethods: In this multicenter, retrospective, observational study, we enrolled consecutive patients with COVID-19 who were admitted to seven ICUs in Guangdong Province. Demographic data, symptoms, laboratory findings, comorbidities, treatment, and outcomes were collected. Data were compared between patients with and without intubation.\nResults: A total of 45 COVID-19 patients required ICU admission in the study hospitals [mean age 56.7 +- 15.4 years, 29 males (64.4%)]. The most common symptoms at onset were fever and cough. Most patients presented with lymphopenia and elevated lactate dehydrogenase. Treatment with antiviral drugs was initiated in all patients. Thirty-six patients (80%) developed acute respiratory distress syndrome at ICU admission, and 15 (33.3%) septic shock. Twenty patients (44.4%) were intubated, and 10 (22.2%) received extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. The 60-day mortality was 4.4% (2 of 45).\nConclusion: COVID-19 patients admitted to ICU were characterized by fever, lymphopenia, acute respiratory failure, and multiple organ dysfunction. The mortality of ICU patients in Guangdong Province was relatively low with a small sample size.\nIntroduction\nIn December 2019, human infection with a novel coronavirus, known as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus disease 2 (SARS-CoV-2), was confirmed in Wuhan, China, and spread rapidly beyond Wuhan and around the world. By May 1, 2020, a total of 84,388 patients were infected in mainland China, with 4,643 deaths, according to a Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention report. Previous studies have mainly focused on the general epidemiological findings, clinical presentation, and clinical outcomes of mild and moderately affected patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). One recent study reported the characteristics of critically ill patients in a single center in Wuhan with 61.5% mortality. However, the clinical characteristics of patients with COVID-19 admitted to intensive care units (ICUs) in China but outside of Wuhan have not been described, including in Guangdong Province, where by May 1, 2020, more than 1,000 people had been confirmed as having COVID-19. Here, we describe the characteristics and treatment of ICU patients with COVID-19 in Guangdong Province.\nMethods\nStudy Design\nThis multicenter, retrospective, observational study was designed, and conducted by the First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University. Seven hospitals were involved: First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University, Dongguan People's Hospital, Foshan First People's Hospital, First Affiliated Hospital of Shantou University Medical College, Affiliated Hospital of Guangdong Medical University, Huizhou Municipal Central Hospital, and Zhongshan City People's Hospital. The details of the ICUs and infection control practices are provided in the Supplementary Appendix (Supplementary Table 1). The study was approved by the Ethics Commission of the First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University. The informed consent requirement was waived because the study was retrospective.\nPatients\nConsecutive patients were enrolled from January 14, 2020, to February 20, 2020, and all had confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection by real-time polymerase-chain-reaction testing of throat swab specimens. The illness severity of COVID-19 was defined according to the Chinese management guideline for COVID-19 (version 7.0). Severe cases were defined as meeting any of the following criteria: (1) respiratory distress (&gt;=30 breaths/ min); (2) oxygen saturation &lt;= 93% at rest; (3) arterial partial pressure of oxygen (Pao2)/ fraction of inspired oxygen (Fio2) &lt;= 300 mm Hg. Critical cases were defined as meeting any of the following criteria: (1) respiratory failure and requiring mechanical ventilation; (2) shock; (3) with other organ failure that required ICU care. In our study, the criteria for ICU admission included both the severe cases and critical cases. For the enrolled patients, their living status, intubation, weaning, and ICU and hospital discharge dates were confirmed on April 20, 2020.\nData Collection\nMedical records of patients who were in the ICU from January 14, 2020, to April 20, 2020, were extracted and sent to the data collection center in the First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University. A team of ICU doctors who had been treating patients with COVID-19 collected and reviewed the data. If information was not clear, the central working group contacted the doctor responsible for the treatment of the patient for clarification. Information recorded included demographic data, underlying conditions, symptoms, laboratory and chest radiograph findings, comorbidities, intubation rates, and ventilator settings prior to and during ICU therapy.\nDefinition\nFever was defined as axillary temperature of at least 37.3 C. The incidence of COVID-19-related comorbidities was identified, including acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), septic shock, cardiac injury, acute kidney injury, liver dysfunction, and gastrointestinal hemorrhage. ARDS was diagnosed according to the Berlin definition, and septic shock was identified by the Sepsis-3 definition. Acute kidney injury was identified on the basis of elevated serum creatinine according to the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes guideline. Cardiac injury was recognized by increased cardiac troponin I or electrocardiography abnormalities of non-specific ST-T waves. Transaminitis was defined by aspartate aminotransferase or alanine aminotransferase levels &gt;80 U/L. Gastrointestinal hemorrhage was identified by a positive fecal or gastric fluid occult blood test.\nStatistics\nContinuous variables are presented as either mean +- standard deviation (SD) or median with interquartile range (IQR), in accordance with either normal or non-normal distributions. For categorical variables, the frequency and percentage of patients in each category were calculated. Differences between intubated and non-intubated patients were assessed with two-sample t-test or Wilcoxon rank-sum test, depending on parametric or non-parametric data for continuous variables and chi2 test for categorical variables. The Spearman correlation coefficient was used to test the correlations between clinical variables. All analyses were performed using SPSS 23.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). A p &lt; 0.05 (two-sided) was considered statistically significant.\nResults\nDemographic, Epidemiologic, and Baseline Characteristics of the Patients\nOf 332 patients with COVID-19, 45 patients requiring ICU admission were identified in the study hospitals. The first case included was confirmed on January 14, 2020, and the last one was confirmed on February 20, 2020. All patients had positive throat swabs for SARS-CoV-2 and bilateral infiltrates on chest radiographs (Figure 1) and were admitted to the ICU.\nTypical chest radiographs of a patient with COVID-19. Chest radiographs of one patient on day 1 at ICU admission (A) and day 5 (B); CT scan of chest of the same patient on day 10 (C) and day 20 (D) after ICU admission.\nThe mean age of the patients was 56.7 years (SD, 15.4), and 29 (64.4%) were men. A total of 26 patients (57.8%) had at least one preexisting condition, including hypertension (46.7%) and diabetes (28.9%). Thirty-six patients had a history of exposure to Hubei Province, and 26 (57.8%) had exposure to patients with COVID-19. Moreover, 19 patients (42.2%) had exposure to a familial cluster (Table 1).\nDemographics and baseline characteristics of patients with severe COVID-19.\nCharacteristics	All patients (n = 45)	Intubated (n = 20)	Not intubated (n = 25)	 	Age (years)	56.7 +- 15.4	62.1 +- 13.56	52.4 +- 15.7	 	Sex, n(%)	 	  Male	29 (64.4)	14 (70)	15 (60)	 	  Female	16 (35.6)	6 (30)	10 (40)	 	Body mass index (kg/m2)	24.2 (22.0-26.7)	23.2 (21.4-25.3)	25.0 (22.9-26.9)	 	Exposure, n(%)	 	  Exposure to Hubei	36 (80.0)	18 (90)	18 (72)	 	  Exposure to confirmed patients	26 (57.8)	12 (60)	14 (56)	 	  Familial cluster	19 (42.2)	11 (55)	8 (32)	 	Positive reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction, n (%)	45 (100)	20 (100)	25 (100)	 	Chronic diseases, n(%)	 	At least one preexisting condition	26 (57.8)	14 (70)	12 (48)	 	  Hypertension	21 (46.7)	11 (55)	10 (40)	 	  Diabetes	13 (28.9)	6 (30)	7 (28)	 	  Chronic cardiac disease	6 (13.3)	4 (20)	2 (8)	 	  Chronic pulmonary disease	4 (8.9)	3 (15)	1 (4)	 	  Cancers	3 (6.7)	1 (5)	2 (8)	 	  Immunosuppression	1 (2.2)	0	1 (4)	 	Smoker (+ex-smoker), n (%)	8 (17.8)	3 (15)	5 (20)	 	Onset symptoms (%)	 	  Fever	39 (86.7)	18 (90)	21 (84)	 	  Cough	32 (71.1)	15 (75)	17 (68)	 	  Sputum	18 (40.0)	7 (35)	11 (44)	 	  Dyspnea	29 (64.4)	15 (75)	14 (56)	 	  Chest tightness	10 (22.2)	6 (30)	4 (20)	 	  Myalgia	4 (8.9)	2 (10)	2 (8)	 	  Malaise	17 (37.8)	10 (50)	7 (28)	 	  Diarrhea	0	0	0	 	Duration from onset of symptoms to ICU admission (days)	10.0 (8.0-13.0)	11.0 (7.5-14.0)	10.0 (8.0-12.0)	 	\nClinical Characteristics and Laboratory Findings\nThe most common symptoms were fever (86.7%), cough (71.1%), and dyspnea (64.4%). The median time from onset of symptoms to ICU admission was 10 days (IQR, 8-13 days) (Table 1). The median Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II) and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) scores of all patients at ICU admission were 14 (8-18) and 4.0 (3.0-6.8), respectively. A total of 20 patients (44.4%) were intubated within 3 days of their ICU admission.\nWhite blood cell counts were in the normal range with neutrophils predominant in intubated patients. Forty-one patients (91.1%) presented with lymphopenia (lymphocytes &lt;1.0 x 109/L). Compared with non-intubated patients, those intubated showed a significant decrease in lymphocyte counts [0.7 (0.5-0.9) vs. 0.4 (0.3-0.5), p &lt; 0.001)]. Elevated levels of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) (normal range, 109-255 U/L) were observed in 32 patients (71.1%). Additionally, intubated patients had higher levels of LDH than non-intubated patients [397.1 (342.2-523.8) vs. 285.3 (215.5-346.7), p = 0.0012]. Spearman correlation analyses showed that SOFA scores were negatively correlated with lymphocyte count and positively associated with LDH (Spearman rho = -0.57 and 0.51, respectively, p &lt; 0.001) (Supplementary Figure 1). Prothrombin time, d-dimer, troponin I, creatine kinase, serum creatinine, aspartate aminotransferase, lactate, procalcitonin, and potassium were significantly increased in intubated patients, whereas Pao2/Fio2 ratio, hemoglobin, and platelet count were lower in intubated than non-intubated patients (Table 2).\nDifferences in Laboratory findings in patients with severe COVID-19.\nVariables	All patients (n = 45)	Intubated (n = 20)	Not intubated (n = 25)	P	 	Pao2/Fio2 ratio (mm Hg)	170.0 (115.5-218.2)	130.6 (100.2-197.0)	198.8 (142.4-279.1)	0.0030	 	Paco2 (mm Hg)	38.3 (35.5-41.5)	40.3 (34.5-47.6)	38.0 (35.1-39.7)	0.1142	 	White blood cell count ( x109/L)	8.3 (5.6-10.3)	9.7 (7.4-12.9)	6.5 (4.8-9.2)	0.0037	 	Neutrophil count ( x109/L)	6.8 (4.4-9.5)	9.0 (6.330-13.15)	5.5 (3.8-8.3)	0.0022	 	Lymphocyte count ( x109/L)	0.5 (0.3-0.7)	0.4 (0.3-0.5)	0.7 (0.5-0.9)	&lt;0.001	 	Hemoglobin (g/L)	121.0 (111.0-133.0)	115.5 (105.5-122.5)	129.0 (116.5-141.0)	0.0024	 	Platelet count ( x109/L)	189.7 +- 72.7	165.5 +- 51.5	209.0 +- 81.9	0.0448	 	Prothrombin time (s)	13.4 (12.3-14.9)	14.6 (13.2-15.2)	13.1 (12.0-13.7)	0.0341	 	Activated partial thromboplastin time (s)	35.8 (28.4, 41.4) (n = 37)	38.9 (35.1, 46.9) (n = 18)	32.1 (26.0,36.0) (n = 19)	0.0880	 	Fibrinogen (g/L)	4.61 (3.61, 5.62) (n = 37)	4.92 (3.67, 6.12) (n = 18)	4.59 (3.8, 5.1) (n = 19)	0.1510	 	d-Dimer (ng/mL)	980 (556, 1,807) (n = 35)	1,490 (859, 2,297) (n = 18)	741 (4,480, 1,231) (n = 17)	0.0235	 	Troponin I (mug/L)	0.01 (0.01-0.02) (n = 40)	0.03 (0.02-0.05) (n = 20)	0.01 (0.00-0.01) (n = 20)	&lt;0.001	 	Lactate dehydrogenase (U/L)	338.0 (248.0-437.9)	397.1 (342.2-523.8)	285.3 (215.5-346.7)	0.0012	 	Creatine kinase (U/L)	66.5 (44.7-114.4) (n = 43)	83.0 (52.2-221.2) (n = 20)	45.0 (30.6-75.4) (n = 23)	0.0034	 	Serum creatinine (mumol/L)	67.6 (54.2-86.0) (n = 44)	75.6 (61.8-116.0) (n = 20)	62.7 (53.3-78.9) (n = 24)	0.0305	 	Total bilirubin (mumol/L)	15.5 (10.5-21.3)	12.5 (9.1-20.6)	19.0 (13.2-22.7)	0.1311	 	Aspartate aminotransferase (U/L)	27 (22.0-39.5) (n = 44)	32.4 (24.8-60.1) (n = 20)	23.1 (20.3-32.8) (n = 24)	0.0261	 	Alanine aminotransferase (U/L)	29.0 (20.1-50.0)	27.3 (17.6-46.8)	30.0 (19.7-56.0)	0.5831	 	Albumin (g/L)	31.6 (30.2-34.5)	31.0 (30.0-34.5)	33.0 (30.3-35.4)	0.7472	 	Lactate (mmol/L)	1.9 (1.5-2.3) (n = 40)	2.1 (1.7-2.7) (n = 20)	1.5 (1.3-2.1) (n = 20)	0.0145	 	Procalcitonin (ng/mL)	0.1 (0.1-0.3)	0.4 (0.1-2.9)	0.1 (0.1-0.1)	&lt;0.001	 	Potassium (mmol/L)	3.9 +- 0.7	4.2 +- 0.8	3.7 +- 0.5	0.0196	 	Sodium (mmol/L)	137.2 +- 4.0	138.2 +- 5.0	136.3 +- 2.8	0.1081	 	\nAll the values were taken at the ICU admission.\nAccording to Berlin definition, 36 patients (80%) were diagnosed with ARDS at ICU admission, 5 (13.9%) with mild ARDS, 22 (61.1%) with moderate ARDS, and 9 (25%) with severe ARDS. Most patients had developed organ function damage during ICU stay, including 15 (33.3%) with septic shock, 8 (17.8%) with acute kidney injury, 15 (33.3%) with cardiac injury, 28 (62.2%) with transaminitis, 14 (31.1%) with gastrointestinal hemorrhage, and 4 (8.9%) with barotrauma.

A total of 14 patients received oseltamivir, 29 with ribavirin, 22 with alpha-interferon, 24 with lopinavir-ritonavir, and 21 with arbidol (Supplementary Table 2). Antifungal agents were given to 19 patients (42.2%). A total of 28 patients (62.2%) had received glucocorticoids, 28 (62.2%) had received immunoglobulin, and 35 (77.8%) had received albumin (Table 3). Convalescent plasma was applied in six critically ill patients (13.3%), and no transfusion reactions occurred (Supplementary Table 2).\nOf the 37 patients (82.2%) treated with a high-flow nasal cannula, 6 failed and received non-invasive mechanical ventilation; 13 failed and were intubated. Of the 17 patients (37.8%) with non-invasive mechanical ventilation, 7 failed and were intubated. Thus, 20 patients (44.4%) received invasive mechanical ventilation. For intubated patients, tidal volumes of 7.0 mL/kg predicted body weight were applied in accordance with lung protective ventilation strategy.

NIV, Non-invasive ventilation; HFNC, High-flow Nasal Cannula.\nClinical Outcomes\nAs of April 20, 2020, 14 patients (70%) were successfully weaned from invasive ventilation. Of 10 patients on ECMO, 6 were weaned, 2 patients died, and 2 were remained on ECMO. A total of 35 patients (77.8%) had been discharged from ICU, and 31 patients (68.9%) had recovered and were discharged from hospital. The 60-day mortality was 4.4% (2 of 45) (Table 4).\nTo identify the potential risks for intubation in patients with COVID-19, a chi2 test showed that older age (age &gt;=60 years), higher SOFA (&gt;=4) and APACHE II (&gt;=15) scores, high LDH (&gt;=255 U/L), and lower lymphocyte count ( &lt;= 0.8 x 109/L) at ICU admission were associated with a higher risk for intubation (Supplementary Table 3).\nDiscussion\nThis study presents a multicenter cohort of 45 patients admitted to ICUs for COVID-19 outside of Wuhan. Of all included patients, 36 (80%) developed ARDS at ICU admission, 20 (44.4%) required invasive mechanical ventilation, and 10 (22.2%) required ECMO, demonstrating that SARS-CoV-2 can cause severe illness.\nOur study population had many of the clinical characteristics of patients with COVID-19. Lymphocytopenia occurred in more than 90% of COVID-19 patients admitted to ICU, which was similar to the Wuhan cohort. We found that intubated patients had significantly lower lymphocyte counts than non-intubated patients. We found that patients with lower lymphocyte counts were at higher risk for intubation and that lymphocyte counts were significantly negatively correlated with SOFA score at ICU admission. Lymphocytopenia is common in viral pneumonia, particularly in SARS and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS). It was reported that a lymphocyte count &lt;0.8 x 109/L was an independent risk factor for 90-day mortality in viral pneumonia. Therefore, lymphocytopenia may reflect the severity of COVID-19. Dynamic monitoring of the lymphocyte counts might be useful in terms of prognosis during the intensive care phase of the critical illness.\nAlthough our patients were treated with antiviral drugs, including oseltamivir and lopinavir-ritonavir, to date no effective antiviral to treat COVID-19 has been identified. The current approach to clinical management is general supportive, supplemented with critical care and organ support when necessary. It has been suggested that the administration of high-titer anti-influenza immune plasma derived from convalescent or immunized individuals may be clinically beneficial for the treatment of SARS, MERS, and seasonal influenza. Convalescent plasma is a potential treatment in coronavirus infection and has been suggested for use in COVID-19. Therefore, convalescent plasma of patients with COVID-19 was administered to six patients (13.3%) in our cohort, and no transfusion reactions occurred. However, our findings cannot provide evidence of the efficacy of convalescent plasma in critically ill patients with COVID-19 because of limited sample sizes, short observation times, and lack of a randomized controlled group. Thus, treatment for the current outbreak of COVID-19 via convalescent plasma, particularly in patients with critical illness, should be carefully considered before well-designed clinical trials are conducted.\nThe 60-day mortality of ICU patients with COVID-19 was 4.4% (2 of 45) in our cohort, which was lower as compared to reported mortality of ICU patients in Wuhan and around the world. There are a couple of factors associated with lower mortality. First, the numbers of infected cases and mortality rates related to COVID-19 vary from country to country. There is evidence that SARS-CoV-2 has undergone genetic changes in the process of spreading to other parts of the world after affecting China. A SARS-CoV-2 mutation was identified that was thought to have created a more &quot;aggressive&quot; form of the virus. Moreover, SARS-CoV-2 genomic variations were also reported to be associated with a higher mortality rate of COVID-19. Therefore, fewer genetic changes of SARS-CoV-2 in the early beginning of China may account for the relative low mortality in China and in our study. Second, an intensivists-led multidisciplinary team was established and participated in combatting the COVID-19 pandemics at the very beginning of outbreak in the seven hospitals. A well-designed Web-based video consultation system for critically ill patients with COVID-19 was established and applied across different cities in Guangdong Province. This allowed a multidisciplinary team shared their experience and help with the management of critical illness remotely across hospitals. Third, a rapid response for patients with sudden clinical deterioration was also established to identify patients who developed into severe case and admit them to ICU for further monitor and interventions in a timely manner. The relatively lower APACHE II and SOFA scores (the median APACHE II and SOFA scores were 14 and 4.0, respectively) of all patients at ICU admission indicating a proportion of less critically ill patients were admitted to ICU to receive high-intensity monitor and prompt intensive care interventions. Fourth, the lack of ICU beds and invasive mechanical ventilators, patients management by a non-intensivists-dominated medical team may contribute to a high mortality in the epicenter of the coronavirus outbreak. Therefore, the high mortality of the patients may reflect the crisis of critical care medicine rather than the nature of COVID-19. With great difference, the relatively smaller number of patients in Guangdong Province, adequate ICU beds, and nurse-to-patient ratio (Supplementary Appendix) may partly contributed to a low mortality. Treatments, including convalescent plasma, invasive mechanical ventilation, CRRT, and ECMO, were applied for critically ill patients. Taken together, the mortality was relatively lower in ICU patients with COVID-19 in our cohort.\nLimitations\nOur study has several limitations. First, the study included only 45 COVID-19 patients admitted to ICU from Guangdong Province. The conclusion about the small mortality may be inadequate because of a small sample. More clinical features related to the critical illness may have been identified if a larger sample size had been studied. Second, at the time we wrote this article, a small number of patients had not yet been discharged from ICU, so we were unable to document the exact length of ICU stay, the number of ventilation-free days, the case fatality rate, or the predictors of fatality. A longer follow-up period is needed. Third, the low number of patients prevents performing further statistical analysis such as multivariable logistic regression for independent predictors of intubation.\nConclusions\nThe patients with COVID-19 from Guangdong Province in our study had a lower ICU mortality (2 of 45, 4.4%) but with a small sample size (n = 45). Larger cohort was still needed in future studies. Current treatment for critically ill patients with COVID-19 consists of appropriate support in ICU and careful monitoring until effective drugs are developed.\nData Availability Statement\nAll datasets generated for this study are included in the article/Supplementary Material.\nEthics Statement\nThe studies involving human participants were reviewed and approved by the Ethics Commission of the First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University.

Of six family members who travelled to Wuhan, five were identified as infected with the novel coronavirus.\n\n Additionally, one family member, who did not travel to Wuhan, became infected with the virus after several days of contact with four of the family members.\n\n None of the family members had contacts with Wuhan markets or animals, although two had visited a Wuhan hospital.\n\n Five family members (aged 36–66 years) presented with fever, upper or lower respiratory tract symptoms, or diarrhoea, or a combination of these 3–6 days after exposure.\n\n They presented to our hospital (The University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen) 6–10 days after symptom onset.\n\n They and one asymptomatic child (aged 10 years) had radiological ground-glass lung opacities.\n\n Older patients (aged &gt;60 years) had more systemic symptoms, extensive radiological ground-glass lung changes, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and increased C-reactive protein and lactate dehydrogenase levels.\n\n The nasopharyngeal or throat swabs of these six patients were negative for known respiratory microbes by point-of-care multiplex RT-PCR, but five patients (four adults and the child) were RT-PCR positive for genes encoding the internal RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and surface Spike protein of this novel coronavirus, which were confirmed by Sanger sequencing.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these five patients' RT-PCR amplicons and two full genomes by next-generation sequencing showed that this is a novel coronavirus, which is closest to the bat severe acute respiatory syndrome (SARS)-related coronaviruses found in Chinese horseshoe bats.\n\n\nInterpretation\nOur findings are consistent with person-to-person transmission of this novel coronavirus in hospital and family settings, and the reports of infected travellers in other geographical regions.\n\n\nFunding\nThe Shaw Foundation Hong Kong, Michael Seak-Kan Tong, Respiratory Viral Research Foundation Limited, Hui

NLR and categorized patients by quartile of this ratio.\n\n The association of NLR quartiles and 28-day mortality was assessed using multivariable logistic regression.\n\n Secondary outcomes included

and outcomes of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia in Wuhan, China: a single-centered, retrospective, observational study","abstract":"Background\nAn ongoing outbreak of pneumonia associated with the severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) started in December, 2019, in Wuhan, China.\n\n Information about critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection is scarce.\n\n We aimed to describe the clinical course and outcomes of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this single-centered, retrospective, observational study, we enrolled 52 critically ill adult patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia who were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) of Wuhan Jin Yin-tan hospital (Wuhan, China) between late December, 2019, and Jan 26, 2020. Demographic data, symptoms, laboratory values, comorbidities, treatments, and clinical outcomes were all collected.\n\n Data were compared between survivors and non-survivors.\n\n The primary outcome was 28-day mortality, as of Feb 9, 2020. Secondary outcomes included incidence of SARS-CoV-2-related acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and the proportion of patients requiring mechanical ventilation.\n\n\nFindings\nOf 710 patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, 52 critically ill adult patients were included.\n\n The mean age of the 52 patients was 59·7 (SD 13·3) years, 35 (67%) were men, 21 (40%) had chronic illness, 51 (98%) had fever.\n\n 32 (61·5%) patients had died at 28 days, and the median duration from admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) to death was 7 (IQR 3–11) days for non-survivors.\n\n Compared with survivors, non-survivors were older (64·6 years [11·2] vs 51·9 years [12·9]), more likely to develop ARDS (26 [81%] patients vs 9 [45%] patients), and more likely to receive mechanical ventilation (30 [94%] patients vs 7 [35%] patients), either invasively or non-invasively.\n\n Most patients had organ function damage, including 35 (67%) with ARDS, 15 (29%) with acute kidney injury, 12 (23%) with cardiac injury, 15 (29%) with liver dysfunction, and one (2%) with pneumothorax.\n\n 37 (71%) patients required mechanical ventilation.\n\n Hospital-acquired infection occurred in seven (13·5%) patients.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe mortality of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia is considerable.\n\n The survival time of the non-survivors is likely to be within 1–2 weeks after ICU admission.\n\n Older patients (&gt;65 years) with comorbidities and ARDS are at increased risk of death.\n\n The severity of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia poses great strain on critical care resources in hospitals, especially if they are not adequately staffed or resourced.\n\n\nFunding\nNone.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7102538","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Elsevier

Meta-Analysis of Randomized Controlled Trials","abstract":"\nWhat Is Known and Objective.\n To reevaluate the benefits and risks of corticosteroid treatment in adult patients with septic shock.\n Methods.\n This study was performed based on PRISMA guidelines.\n Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of corticosteroids versus placebo were retrieved from PubMed, MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Science, the Cochrane Central RCTs, and ClinicalTrials.\ngov from January 1980 to April 2018. We also conducted a trial sequential analysis to indicate the possibility of type I or II errors and calculate the information size.\n Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation approach (GRADE) was applying to assess the certainty of evidence at the primary outcome level.\n Results.\n Twenty-one RCTs were identified and analyzed.\n Patients treated with corticosteroid had a 7% reduction in relative risk in 28-day all-cause mortality compared to controls (RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.88 to 0.99).\n However, there were no significant differences for the intensive care unit (ICU) mortality (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.09) or in-hospital mortality (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.11).\n Corticosteroids shortened the length of ICU stay by 1.04 days (RR -1.04, 95% CI -1.72 to -0.36) and the length of hospital stay by 2.49 days (RR -2.49, 95% CI -4.96 to -0.02).\n Corticosteroids increased the risk of hyperglycemia (RR 1.11, 95% CI 1.06 to 1.16) but not gastroduodenal bleeding (RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.37) or superinfection (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.15).\n However, some date on secondary outcomes were unavailable because they were not measured or not reported in the included studies which may cause a lack of power or selective outcome reporting.\n The information size was calculated at 10044 patients.\n Trial sequential analysis showed that the meta-analysis was conclusive and the risk of type 2 error was minimal.\n What Is New and Conclusion.\n Corticosteroids are likely to be effective in reducing 28-day mortality and attenuating septic shock without increasing the rate of life-threatening complications.\n TSA showed that the risk of type II error in this meta-analysis was minimal and the result was conclusive.\n","id":"PMC6590573","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Hindawi","authors":[{"firstname":"X.-J.","surname":"Lian","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"D.-Z.","surname":"Huang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Y.-S.","surname":"Cao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Y.-X.","surname":"Wei","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Z.-Z.","surname":"Lian","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"T.-H.","surname":"Qin","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"P.-C.","surname":"He","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Y.-H.","surname":"Liu","email":"lyh0718@126.com","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"S.-H.","surname":"Wang","email":"wshdoctor@139.com","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"S.-H.","surname":"Wang","email":"wshdoctor@139.com","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1016/j.ajem.2018.11.040","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Can corticosteroids reduce the mortality of patients with severe sepsis?

of treatment selection, conditional on observed baseline covariates.\n Weighting subjects by the inverse probability of treatment received creates a synthetic sample in which treatment assignment is independent of measured baseline covariates.\n Inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) using the propensity score allows one to obtain unbiased estimates of average treatment effects.\n However, these estimates are only valid if there are no residual systematic differences in observed baseline characteristics between treated and control subjects in the sample weighted by the estimated inverse probability of treatment.\n We report on a systematic literature review, in which we found that the use of IPTW has increased rapidly in recent years, but that in the most recent year, a majority of studies did not formally examine whether weighting balanced measured covariates between treatment groups.\n We then proceed to describe a suite of quantitative and qualitative methods that allow one to assess whether measured baseline covariates are balanced between treatment groups in the weighted sample.\n The quantitative methods use the weighted standardized difference to compare means, prevalences, higher?order moments, and interactions.\n The qualitative methods employ graphical methods to compare the distribution of continuous baseline covariates between treated

that the use of a bootstrap estimator resulted in approximately correct estimates of standard errors and confidence intervals with the correct coverage rates.\n The other estimators resulted in biased

center, on 5,383 patients admitted during a one year period (1 July 2000–30 June 2001).\n\n\nResults\nAcute kidney injury occurred in 67% of intensive care unit admissions, with maximum RIFLE class R, class I and class F in 12%, 27% and 28%, respectively.\n\n Of the 1,510 patients (28%) that reached a level of risk, 840 (56%) progressed.\n\n Patients with maximum RIFLE class R, class I and class F had hospital mortality rates of 8.8%, 11.4% and 26.3%, respectively, compared with 5.5% for patients without acute kidney injury.\n\n Additionally, acute kidney injury (hazard ratio, 1.7; 95% confidence interval, 1.28–2.13; P &lt; 0.001) and maximum RIFLE class I (hazard ratio, 1.4; 95% confidence interval, 1.02–1.88; P = 0.037) and class F (hazard ratio, 2.7; 95% confidence interval, 2.03–3.55; P &lt; 0.001) were associated with hospital mortality after adjusting for multiple covariates.\n\n\nConclusion\nIn this general intensive care unit population, acute kidney 'risk, injury, failure', as defined by the newly developed RIFLE classification, is associated with increased hospital mortality and resource use.\n\n Patients with RIFLE class R are indeed at high risk of progression to class I or class F.\n\n Patients with RIFLE class I or class F incur a significantly increased length of stay and an increased risk of inhospital mortality compared with those who do not progress past class R or those who never develop acute kidney injury, even after adjusting for baseline severity of illness, case mix, race, gender and age.\n\n\n","id":"PMC1550961","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"BioMed Central","authors":[{"firstname":"Eric

acute renal failure (ARF) in critically ill patients.\n\n More than 30 different definitions have been used in the literature, creating much confusion and making comparisons difficult.\n\n Similarly, strong debate exists on the validity and clinical relevance of animal models of ARF; on choices of fluid management and of end-points for trials of new interventions in this field; and on how information technology can be used to assist this process.\n\n Accordingly, we sought to review the available evidence, make recommendations and delineate key questions for future studies.\n\n\nMethods\nWe undertook a systematic review of the literature using Medline and PubMed searches.\n\n We determined a list of key questions and convened a 2-day consensus conference to develop summary statements via a series of alternating breakout and plenary sessions.\n\n In these sessions, we identified supporting evidence and generated recommendations and/or directions for future research.\n\n\nResults\nWe found sufficient consensus on 47 questions to allow the development of recommendations.\n\n Importantly, we were able to develop a consensus definition for ARF.\n\n

acute renal failure (ARF) remains poor, with mortality ranging from 40% to 65%.\n\n The aim of the present observational study was to analyze the influence of patient characteristics and fluid balance on the outcome of ARF in intensive care unit (ICU) patients.\n\n\nMethods\nThe data were extracted from the Sepsis Occurrence in Acutely Ill Patients (SOAP) study, a multicenter observational cohort study to which 198 ICUs from 24 European countries contributed.\n\n All adult patients admitted to a participating ICU between 1 and 15 May 2002, except those admitted for uncomplicated postoperative surveillance, were eligible for the study.\n\n For the purposes of this substudy, patients were divided into two groups according to whether they had ARF.\n\n The groups were compared with respect to patient characteristics, fluid balance, and outcome.\n\n\nResults\nOf the 3,147 patients included in the SOAP study, 1,120 (36%) had ARF at some point during their ICU stay.\n\n Sixty-day mortality rates were 36% in patients with ARF and 16% in patients without ARF (P &lt; 0.01).\n\n Oliguric patients and patients treated with renal replacement therapy (RRT) had higher 60-day mortality rates than patients without oliguria or the need for RRT (41% versus 33% and 52% versus 32%, respectively; P &lt; 0.01).\n\n Independent risk factors for 60-day mortality in the patients with ARF were age, Simplified Acute Physiology Score II (SAPS II), heart failure, liver cirrhosis, medical admission, mean fluid balance, and need for mechanical ventilation.\n\n Among patients treated with RRT, length of stay and mortality were lower when RRT was started early in the course of the ICU stay.\n\n\nConclusion\nIn this large European multicenter study, a positive fluid balance was an important factor associated with increased 60-day mortality.\n\n Outcome among patients treated with RRT was better when RRT was started early in the course of the ICU stay.\n\n\n","id":"PMC2481469","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"BioMed

unclear.\n\n\nMethods\nA meta-analysis was conducted of randomized controlled trials evaluating AKI after infusion of hyperoncotic albumin and hydroxyethyl starch (HES) solutions.\n\n Mortality was a secondary endpoint.\n\n Eligible trials were sought by multiple methods, and the pooled odds ratios (OR) for AKI and death and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were computed under a random effects

influenza A virus subtype H7N9 (H7N9) or 2009 pandemic H1N1 influenza virus were compared in a recent report, but associated cardiac complications remain unclear.\n\n The present retrospective study investigated whether cardiac complications in critically ill patients with H7N9 infections differed from those infected with the pandemic H1N1 influenza virus strain.\n\n\nMethods\nSuspect cases were confirmed by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction assays with specific confirmation of the pandemic H1N1 strain at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\n Comparisons were conducted at the individual-level data of critically ill patients hospitalized with H7N9 (n = 24) or pandemic H1N1 influenza virus (n = 22) infections in Suzhou, China.\n\n Changes in cardiac biochemical markers, echocardiography, and electrocardiography during hospitalization in the intensive care unit were considered signs of cardiac complications.\n\n\nResults\nThe following findings were more common among the H7N9 group relative to the pandemic H1N1 influenza virus group: greater tricuspid regurgitation pressure gradient, sinus tachycardia (heartbeat ? 130 bpm), ST segment depression, right ventricular dysfunction, and elevated cardiac biochemical markers.\n\n Pericardial effusion was more often found among pandemic H1N1 influenza virus patients than in the H7N9 group.\n\n In both groups, most of the cardiac complications were detected from day 6 to 14 after the onset of influenza symptoms.\n\n Those who developed cardiac complications were especially vulnerable during the first four days after initiation of mechanical ventilation.\n\n Cardiac complications were reversible in the vast majority of discharged H7N9 patients.\n\n\nConclusions\nCritically ill hospitalized H7N9 patients experienced a higher rate of cardiac complications than did patients with 2009 pandemic H1N1 influenza virus infections, with the exception of pericardial effusion.\n\n This study may help in the prevention, identification, and treatment of influenza-induced cardiac complications in both pandemic H1N1 influenza virus and H7N9 infections.\n\n\n","id":"PMC9425542","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Elsevier","authors":[{"firstname":"Jiajia","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Hua","surname":"Xu","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Xinjing","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Daguo","surname":"Zhao","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Shenglan","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Xue","surname":"Sun","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Jian-an","surname":"Huang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Qiang","surname":"Guo","email":"ggqq1018@hotmail.com","contributions":"1"}],"References

infection are rare, subclinical influenza-associated cardiac abnormalities may occur more frequently.\n\n We investigated the prevalence of subclinical cardiac findings.\n\n \nMethods \nAfter obtaining their written informed consent, 102 subjects were enrolled in the present study.\n\n The study subjects underwent a first set of examinations, which included electrocardiography (ECG), echocardiography, and the measurement of their cardiac enzyme levels.\n\n Those with one or more abnormal findings among these examinations were encouraged to undergo a repeat examination 2 weeks later.\n\n \nResults \nAmong the 102 subjects enrolled, 22 (21.6%) were judged to have cardiac findings, including ST-T abnormalities, pericardial effusion, diastolic dysfunction, and cardiac enzyme elevation.\n\n Eighteen of these 20 subjects underwent a second screening at a median of 14 days later, and it was found that 11 of the 18 subjects were free from cardiac findings on this second examination.\n\n This suggested that the abnormalities were only transient and they therefore might have been associated with influenza.\n\n Approximately 20% of the influenza patients enrolled had cardiac findings, including ST-T segment abnormalities, pericardial effusion, and cardiac enzyme elevation.\n\n \nConclusion \nAmong the 102 patients who were studied, the cardiac findings were only

this study was to further clarify clinical characteristics and predict mortality risk among patients with viral pneumonia.\n\n\nMethods\nA total of 528 patients with viral pneumonia at RuiJin hospital in Shanghai from May 2015 to May 2019 were recruited.\n\n Multiplex real-time RT-PCR was used to detect respiratory viruses.\n\n Demographic information, comorbidities, routine laboratory examinations, immunological indexes, etiological detections, radiological images and treatment were collected on admission.\n\n\nResults\n76 (14.4%) patients died within 90 days in hospital.\n\n A predictive MuLBSTA score was calculated on the basis of a multivariate logistic regression model in order to predict mortality with a weighted score that included multilobular infiltrates (OR = 5.20, 95% CI 1.41–12.52, p = 0.010; 5 points), lymphocyte ? 0.8?109/L (OR = 4.53, 95% CI 2.55–8.05, p &lt; 0.001; 4 points), bacterial coinfection (OR = 3.71, 95% CI 2.11–6.51, p &lt; 0.001; 4 points), acute-smoker (OR = 3.19, 95% CI 1.34–6.26, p = 0.001; 3 points), quit-smoker (OR = 2.18, 95% CI 0.99–4.82, p = 0.054; 2 points), hypertension (OR = 2.39, 95% CI 1.55–4.26, p = 0.003; 2 points) and age ?60 years (OR = 2.14, 95% CI 1.04–4.39, p = 0.038; 2 points).\n\n 12 points was used as a cut-off value for mortality risk stratification.\n\n This model showed sensitivity of 0.776, specificity of 0.778 and a better predictive ability than CURB-65 (AUROC = 0.773 vs.\n\n 0.717, p &lt; 0.001).\n\n\nConclusion\nHere, we designed an easy-to-use clinically predictive tool for assessing 90-day mortality risk of viral pneumonia.\n\n It can accurately stratify hospitalized patients with viral pneumonia into relevant risk categories and could provide guidance to make further clinical decisions.\n\n\n","id":"PMC6901688","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Frontiers Media

envelope protein: current knowledge","abstract":"Background\nid='Par1'>Coronaviruses (CoVs) primarily cause enzootic infections in birds and mammals but, in the last few decades, have shown to be capable of infecting humans as well.\n\n The outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003 and, more recently, Middle-East respiratory syndrome (MERS) has demonstrated the lethality of CoVs when they cross the species barrier and infect humans.\n\n A renewed interest in coronaviral research has led to the discovery of several novel human CoVs and since then much progress has been made in understanding the CoV life cycle.\n\n The CoV envelope (E) protein is a small, integral membrane protein involved in several aspects of the virus’ life cycle, such as assembly, budding, envelope formation, and pathogenesis.\n\n Recent studies have expanded on its structural motifs and topology, its functions as an ion-channelling viroporin, and its interactions with both other CoV proteins and host cell proteins.\n\n\nMain body\nid='Par2'>This review aims to establish the current knowledge on CoV E by highlighting the recent progress that has been made and comparing it to previous knowledge.\n\n It also compares E to other viral proteins of a similar nature to speculate the relevance of these new findings.\n\n Good progress has been made but much still remains unknown and this review has identified some gaps in the current knowledge and made suggestions for consideration in future research.\n\n\nConclusions\nid='Par3'>The most progress has been made on SARS-CoV E, highlighting specific structural requirements for its functions in the CoV life cycle as well as mechanisms behind its pathogenesis.\n\n Data shows that E is involved in critical aspects of the viral life cycle and that CoVs lacking E make promising vaccine candidates.\n\n The high mortality rate of certain CoVs, along with their ease of transmission, underpins the need for more research into CoV molecular biology which can aid in the production of effective anti-coronaviral agents for both human CoVs and enzootic CoVs.\n\n\n","id":"PMC6537279","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"BioMed

2019 was traced to a seafood wholesale market in Wuhan of China.\n Within a few weeks, a novel coronavirus tentatively named as 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) was announced by the World Health Organization.\n We performed bioinformatics analysis on a virus genome from a patient with 2019-nCoV infection and compared it with other related coronavirus genomes.\n Overall, the genome of

other SARS-related coronaviruses.\n Remarkably, its orf3b encodes a completely novel short protein.\n Furthermore, its new orf8 likely encodes a secreted protein with an alpha-helix, following with a beta-sheet(s) containing six strands.\n Learning from the roles of civet in SARS and camel in MERS, hunting for the animal source of 2019-nCoV and its more ancestral virus would be important for

cellular functions.\n When overwhelming the antioxidant defense system, the excess of ROS induces oxidative stress.\n Viral infections lead to diseases characterized by a broad spectrum of clinical symptoms, with oxidative stress being one of their hallmarks.\n In many cases, ROS can, in turn, enhance viral replication leading to an amplification loop.\n Another important parameter for viral replication and pathogenicity is the nutritional status of the host.\n Viral infection simultaneously increases the demand for micronutrients and causes their loss, which leads to a deficiency that can be compensated by micronutrient supplementation.\n Among the nutrients implicated in viral infection, selenium (Se) has an important role in antioxidant defense, redox signaling and redox homeostasis.\n Most of biological activities of selenium is performed through its incorporation as a rare amino acid selenocysteine in the essential family of selenoproteins.\n Selenium deficiency, which is the main regulator of selenoprotein expression, has been associated with the pathogenicity of several viruses.\n In addition, several selenoprotein members, including glutathione peroxidases

Injury Independent of Neutrophil Infiltration","abstract":"Background\nVentilator-induced lung injury is a form of acute lung injury that develops in critically ill patients on mechanical ventilation and has a high degree of mortality.\n\n Nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase is an enzyme that is highly upregulated in ventilator-induced lung injury and exacerbates the injury when given exogenously.\n\n Nicotinamide (vitamin B3) directly inhibits downstream pathways activated by Nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase and is protective in other models of acute lung injury.\n\n\nMethods\nWe administered nicotinamide i.\n\np.\n\n to mice undergoing mechanical ventilation with high tidal volumes to study the effects of nicotinamide on ventilator-induced lung injury.\n\n Measures of injury included oxygen saturations and bronchoalveolar lavage neutrophil counts, protein, and cytokine levels.\n\n We also measured expression of nicotinamide phosophoribosyltransferase, and its downstream effectors Sirt1 and Cebpa, Cebpb, Cebpe.\n\n We assessed the effect of nicotinamide on the production of nitric oxide during ventilator-induced lung injury.\n\n We also studied the effects of ventilator-induced lung injury in mice deficient in C/EBP?.\n\n\nResults\nNicotinamide treatment significantly inhibited neutrophil infiltration into the lungs during ventilator-induced lung injury, but did not affect protein leakage or cytokine production.\n\n Surprisingly, mice treated with nicotinamide developed significantly worse hypoxemia during mechanical ventilation.\n\n This effect was not linked to increases in nitric oxide production or alterations in expression of Nicotinamide phosphoribosyl transferase, Sirt1, or Cebpa and Cebpb.\n\n Cebpe mRNA levels were decreased with either nicotinamide treatment or mechanical ventilation, but mice lacking C/EBP? developed the same degree of hypoxemia and ventilator-induced lung injury as wild-type mice.\n\n\nConclusions\nNicotinamide treatment during VILI inhibits neutrophil infiltration of the lungs consistent with a strong anti-inflammatory effect, but paradoxically also leads to the development of significant hypoxemia.\n\n These findings suggest that pulmonary neutrophilia is not linked to hypoxemia in ventilator-induced lung injury, and that nicotinamide exacerbates hypoxemia during VILI.\n\n\n","id":"PMC4395431","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Public Library of Science","authors":[{"firstname":"Heather

In this study, we aimed to further characterize the role of macrophage-derived EVs in immune responses against hepatitis C virus (HCV) and the potential of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) to modulate this modality of innate immunity.\n To this end, EVs were isolated from interferon-stimulated macrophage cultures or from serum of patients with acute or chronic hepatitis C.\n EVs were characterized by electron microscopy, flow cytometry, RNA-sequencing, and Western blot analysis.\n The effect of EVs on replication of HCV was assessed in coculture models.\n Functional analyses were performed to assess the impact of PUFAs on EV-mediated antiviral immunity.\n We found that macrophages secreted various cytokines shortly after stimulation with type I and II IFN, which orchestrated a fast but short-lasting antiviral state.\n This rapid innate immune answer was followed by the production of macrophage-derived EVs, which induced a late, but long-lasting inhibitory effect on HCV replication.\n Of note, exposure of macrophages to PUFAs, which are important regulators of immune responses, dampened EV-mediated antiviral immune responses.\n Finally, EVs from patients with hepatitis C exhibited long-lasting antiviral activities during IFN therapy as well.\n The antiviral effect of EVs from Caucasian and Japanese patients differed, which may be explained by different nutritional uptake of PUFAs.\n In conclusion, our data indicate that macrophage-derived EVs mediate long-lasting inhibitory effects on HCV replication, which may bridge the time until efficient adaptive immune responses are established, and which can be blunted by PUFAs.\n","id":"PMC5906748","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Frontiers Media

coronavirus by neutralisation tests with confirmation by plaque reduction assays.\n Interferon-beta-1a, leukocytic interferon-alpha, ribavirin, lopinavir, rimantadine, baicalin and glycyrrhizin showed antiviral activity.\n The two interferons were only active if the cell lines were pre-incubated with the drugs 16 h before viral inoculation.\n Results were confirmed by plaque reduction assays.\n Antiviral activity varied with the use of different cell lines.\n Checkerboard assays for synergy were performed showing combinations of interferon beta-1a or leukocytic interferon-alpha with ribavirin are synergistic.\n Since the clinical and toxicity profiles of these agents are well known, they should be considered either singly or in combination for prophylaxis or treatment of SARS in randomised placebo controlled trials in future epidemics.\n","id":"PMC7128415","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Elsevier

immunostimulatory activity that led to its application to diverse pathological conditions, including cancer.\n Studies in animal models and human patients have shown promising results in different types of malignancies, especially when T?1 was used in combination with other chemo- and immune therapies.\n For this reason, the advancements in our knowledge on the adjuvant role of T?1 have moved in parallel with the development of novel cancer therapies in a way that T?1 was integrated to changing paradigms and protocols, and tested for increased efficacy and safety.\n Cancer immunotherapy has recently experienced a tremendous boost following the development and clinical application of immune checkpoint inhibitors.\n By unleashing the full potential of the adaptive immune response, checkpoint inhibitors were expected to be very effective against tumors, but it soon became clear that a widespread and successful application was not straightforward and shortcomings in efficacy and safety clearly emerged.\n This scenario led to the development of novel concepts in immunotherapy and the design of combination protocols to overcome these limitations, thus opening up novel opportunities for T?1 application.\n Herein, we summarize in a historical perspective the use of T?1 in cancer, with particular reference to melanoma, hepatocellular carcinoma and lung cancer.\n We will discuss the current limitations of checkpoint inhibitors in clinical practice and the mechanisms at the basis of a potential application of T?1 in combination

entire genomic RNA and interacts with viron structural proteins, thus playing important roles in the process of virus particle assembly and release.\n Protein–protein interaction analysis using bioinformatics tools indicated that SARS_NP may bind to human cyclophilin A (hCypA), and surface plasmon resonance (SPR) technology revealed this binding with the equilibrium dissociation constant ranging from 6 to 160 nM.\n The probable binding sites of these two proteins were detected by modeling the three-dimensional structure of the SARS_NP–hCypA complex, from which the important interaction residue pairs between the proteins were deduced.\n Mutagenesis experiments were carried out for validating the binding model, whose correctness was assessed by the observed effects on the binding affinities between the proteins.\n The reliability of the binding sites derived by the molecular modeling was confirmed by the fact that the computationally predicted values of the relative free energies of the binding for SARS_NP (or hCypA) mutants to the wild-type hCypA (or SARS_NP) are in good agreement with the data determined by SPR.\n Such presently observed SARS_NP–hCypA

disease.\n The outbreak of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2002/2003 has demonstrated human vulnerability to (Coronavirus) CoV epidemics.\n Neither vaccines nor therapeutics are available against human and animal CoVs.\n Knowledge of host cell proteins that take part in pivotal virus-host interactions could define broad-spectrum antiviral targets.\n In this study, we used a systems biology approach employing a genome-wide yeast-two hybrid interaction screen to identify immunopilins (PPIA, PPIB, PPIH, PPIG, FKBP1A, FKBP1B) as interaction partners of the CoV non-structural protein 1 (Nsp1).\n These molecules modulate the Calcineurin/NFAT pathway that plays an important role in immune cell activation.\n Overexpression of NSP1 and infection with live SARS-CoV strongly increased signalling through the Calcineurin/NFAT pathway and enhanced the induction of interleukin 2, compatible with late-stage immunopathogenicity and long-term cytokine dysregulation as observed in severe SARS cases.\n Conversely, inhibition of cyclophilins by cyclosporine A (CspA) blocked the replication of CoVs of all genera, including SARS-CoV, human CoV-229E and -NL-63, feline CoV, as well as avian infectious bronchitis virus.\n Non-immunosuppressive derivatives of CspA might serve as broad-range CoV inhibitors applicable against emerging CoVs as well as ubiquitous pathogens of

Combined, the results indicate that GS-5734 interferes with the nsp12 polymerase even in the setting of intact ExoN proofreading activity and that resistance can be overcome with increased, nontoxic concentrations of GS-5734, further supporting the development of GS-5734 as a broad-spectrum therapeutic to protect against contemporary and emerging CoVs.\n","id":"PMC5844999","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"American Society for Microbiology","authors":[{"firstname":"Maria L.","surname":"Agostini","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Erica L.","surname":"Andres","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Amy C.","surname":"Sims","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Rachel L.","surname":"Graham","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Timothy P.","surname":"Sheahan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xiaotao","surname":"Lu","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Everett Clinton","surname":"Smith","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"James Brett","surname":"Case","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Joy Y.","surname":"Feng","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Robert","surname":"Jordan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Adrian S.","surname":"Ray","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Tomas","surname":"Cihlar","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Dustin","surname":"Siegel","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Richard L.","surname":"Mackman","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Michael O.","surname":"Clarke","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ralph S.","surname":"Baric","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Mark R.","surname":"Denison","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Kanta","surname":"Subbarao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Kanta","surname":"Subbarao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1056/NEJMoa2001191","date":"1970-01-01","title":"First Case of 2019 Novel Coronavirus in the United States","abstract":"An outbreak of novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) that began in Wuhan, China, has spread rapidly, with cases now confirmed in multiple countries.\n We report the first case of 2019-nCoV infection confirmed in the United States and describe the identification, diagnosis, clinical course, and management of the case, including the patient’s initial mild symptoms at presentation with progression to pneumonia on day 9 of illness.\n This case highlights the importance of close coordination between clinicians and public health authorities at the local, state, and federal levels, as well as the need for rapid dissemination of clinical information related to the care of patients with this emerging infection.\n","id":"PMC7092802","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Massachusetts Medical Society","authors":[{"firstname":"Michelle L.","surname":"Holshue","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Chas","surname":"DeBolt","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Scott","surname":"Lindquist","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Kathy H.","surname":"Lofy","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"John","surname":"Wiesman","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Hollianne","surname":"Bruce","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Christopher","surname":"Spitters","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Keith","surname":"Ericson","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Sara","surname":"Wilkerson","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ahmet","surname":"Tural","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"George","surname":"Diaz","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Amanda","surname":"Cohn","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"LeAnne","surname":"Fox","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Anita","surname":"Patel","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Susan I.","surname":"Gerber","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lindsay","surname":"Kim","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Suxiang","surname":"Tong","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xiaoyan","surname":"Lu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Steve","surname":"Lindstrom","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Mark A.","surname":"Pallansch","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"William C.","surname":"Weldon","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Holly M.","surname":"Biggs","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Timothy M.","surname":"Uyeki","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Satish K.","surname":"Pillai","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.2165/00003495-199856010-00013","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Nelfinavir.

IBV replicates not only in respiratory tissues (including the nose, trachea, lungs and airsacs, causing respiratory disease), but also in the kidney (associated with minor or major nephritis), oviduct, and in many parts of the alimentary tract—the oesophagus, proventriculus, duodenum, jejunum, bursa of Fabricius, caecal tonsils, rectum and cloaca, usually without clinical effects.\n The virus can persist, being re-excreted at the onset of egg laying (4 to 5 months of age), believed to be a consequence of the stress of coming into lay.\n Genetic lines of chickens differ in the extent to which IBV causes mortality in chicks, and in respect of clearance of the virus after the acute phase.\n Live attenuated (by passage in chicken embryonated eggs) IBV strains were introduced as vaccines in the 1950s, followed a couple of decades later by inactivated vaccines for boosting protection in egg-laying birds.\n Live vaccines are usually applied to meat-type chickens at 1 day of age.\n In experimental situations this can result in sterile immunity when challenged by virulent homologous virus.\n Although 100% of chickens may be protected (against clinical signs and loss of ciliary activity in trachea), sometimes 10% of vaccinated chicks may not respond with a protective immune response.\n Protection is short lived, the start of the decline being apparent 9 weeks after vaccination with vaccines based on highly attenuated strains.\n IBV exists as scores of serotypes (defined by the neutralization test), cross-protection often being poor.\n Consequently, chickens may be re-vaccinated, with the same or another serotype, two or three weeks later.\n Single applications of inactivated virus has generally led to protection of &lt;50% of chickens.\n Two applications have led to 90 to 100% protection in some reports, but remaining below 50% in others.\n In practice in the field, inactivated vaccines are used in laying birds that have previously been primed with two or three live attenuated virus vaccinations.\n This increases protection of the laying birds against egg production losses and induces a sustained level of serum antibody, which is passed to progeny.\n The large spike glycoprotein (S) comprises a carboxy-terminal S2 subunit (approximately 625 amino acid residues), which anchors S in the virus envelope, and an amino-terminal S1 subunit (approximately 520 residues), believed to largely form the distal bulbous part of S.\n The S1 subunit (purified from IBV virus, expressed using baculovirus or expressed in birds from a fowlpoxvirus vector) induced virus neutralizing antibody.\n Although protective immune responses were induced, multiple inoculations were required and the percentage of protected chickens was too low (&lt;50%) for commercial application.\n Remarkably, expression of S1 in birds using a non-pathogenic fowl adenovirus vector induced protection in 90% and 100% of chickens in two experiments.\n Differences of as little as 5% between the S1 sequences can result in poor cross-protection.\n Differences in S1 of 2 to 3% (10 to 15 amino acids) can change serotype, suggesting that a small number of epitopes are immunodominant with respect to neutralizing antibody.\n Initial studies of the role of the IBV nucleocapsid protein (N) in immunity suggested that immunization with bacterially expressed N, while not inducing protection directly, improved the induction of protection by a subsequent inoculation with inactivated IBV.\n In another study, two intramuscular immunizations of a plasmid expressing N induced protective immunity.\n The basis of immunity to IBV is not well understood.\n Serum antibody levels do not correlate with protection, although local antibody is believed to play a role.\n Adoptive transfer of IBV-infection-induced ?? T cells bearing CD8 antigen protected chicks from challenge infection.\n In conclusion, live attenuated IBV vaccines induce good, although short-lived, protection against homologous challenge, although a minority of individuals may respond poorly.\n Inactivated IBV vaccines are insufficiently efficacious when applied only once and in the absence of priming by live vaccine.\n Two applications of inactivated IBV are much more efficacious, although this is not a commercially viable proposition in the poultry industry.\n However, the cost and logistics of multiple application of a SARS inactivated vaccine would be more acceptable for the protection of human populations, especially if limited to targeted groups (e.\ng.\n health care workers and high-risk contacts).\n Application of a SARS vaccine is perhaps best limited to a minimal number of targeted individuals who can be monitored, as some vaccinated persons might, if infected by SARS coronavirus, become asymptomatic excretors of virus, thereby posing a risk to non-vaccinated people.\n Looking further into the future, the high efficacy of the fowl adenovirus vector expressing the IBV S1 subunit provides optimism for a live SARS vaccine, if that were deemed to be necessary, with the possibility of including the N protein gene.\n","id":"PMC7154303","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Taylor &amp; Francis","authors":[{"firstname":"Dave","surname":"Cavanagh","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"10.1016/j.virol.2014.01.002","date":"2014-01-03","title":"Protection from SARS coronavirus conferred by live measles vaccine expressing the spike glycoprotein","abstract":"The recent identification of a novel human coronavirus responsible of a SARS-like illness in the Middle-East a decade after the SARS pandemic, demonstrates that reemergence of a SARS-like coronavirus from an animal reservoir remains a credible threat.\n Because SARS is contracted by aerosolized contamination of the respiratory tract, a vaccine inducing mucosal long-term protection would be an asset to control new epidemics.\n To this aim, we generated live attenuated recombinant measles vaccine (MV) candidates expressing either the membrane-anchored SARS-CoV spike (S) protein or its secreted soluble ectodomain (Ssol).\n In mice susceptible to measles virus, recombinant MV expressing the anchored full-length S induced the highest titers of neutralizing antibodies and fully protected immunized animals from intranasal infectious challenge with SARS-CoV.\n As compared to immunization with adjuvanted recombinant Ssol protein, recombinant MV induced stronger and Th1-biased responses, a hallmark of live attenuated viruses and a highly desirable feature for an antiviral vaccine.\n","id":"PMC7111909","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Elsevier Inc.","authors":[{"firstname":"Nicolas","surname":"Escriou","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Benoît","surname":"Callendret","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Valérie","surname":"Lorin","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Chantal","surname":"Combredet","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Philippe","surname":"Marianneau","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Michèle","surname":"Février","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Frédéric","surname":"Tangy","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"}]},{"doi":"10.1016/j.virol.2018.05.028","date":"2018-05-31","title":"Live-attenuated bivalent measles virus-derived vaccines targeting Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus induce robust and multifunctional T cell responses against both viruses in an appropriate mouse model","abstract":"Cases of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) continue to occur, making it one of the WHO´s targets for accelerated vaccine development.\n One vaccine candidate is based on live-attenuated measles virus (MV) vaccine encoding the MERS-CoV spike glycoprotein (MERS-S).\n MVvac2-MERS-S(H) induces robust humoral and cellular immunity against MERS-S mediating protection.\n Here, the induction and nature of immunity after vaccination with MVvac2-MERS-S(H) or novel MVvac2-MERS-N were further characterized.\n We focused on the necessity for vector replication and the nature of induced T cells, since functional CD8+ T cells contribute importantly to clearance of MERS-CoV.\n While no immunity against MERS-CoV or MV was detected in MV-susceptible mice after immunization with UV-inactivated virus, replication-competent MVvac2-MERS-S(H) triggered robust neutralizing antibody titers also in adult mice.\n Furthermore, a significant fraction of MERS CoV-specific CD8+ T cells and MV-specific CD4+ T cells simultaneously expressing IFN-?

A novel mAb, CR3022, was identified that neutralized CR3014 escape viruses, did not compete with CR3014 for binding to recombinant S1 fragments, and bound to S1 fragments derived from the civet cat SARS-CoV-like strain SZ3.

investigated the extent of molecular divergence between SARS-CoV-2 and other related coronaviruses.\n Although we found only 4% variability in genomic nucleotides between SARS-CoV-2 and a bat SARS-related coronavirus (SARSr-CoV; RaTG13), the difference at neutral sites was 17%, suggesting the divergence between the two viruses is much larger than previously estimated.\n Our results suggest that the development of new variations in functional sites in the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike seen in SARS-CoV-2 and viruses from pangolin SARSr-CoVs are likely caused by natural selection besides recombination.\n Population genetic analyses of 103 SARS-CoV-2 genomes indicated that these viruses had two major lineages (designated L and S), that are well defined by two different SNPs that show nearly complete linkage across the viral strains sequenced to date.\n We found that L lineage was more prevalent than the S lineage within the limited patient samples we examined.\n The implication of these evolutionary changes on disease etiology remains unclear.\n These findings strongly underscores the urgent need for further comprehensive studies that combine

infection with the SARS?CoV?2 virus.\n\n The major mutation detected to date in the SARS?CoV?2 viral envelope spike protein, which is responsible for virus attachment to the host and is also the main target for host antibodies, is a mutation of an aspartate (D) at position 614 found frequently in Chinese strains to a glycine (G).\n\n We sought to infer health impact of this mutation.\n\n\nResult\nIncreased case fatality rate correlated strongly with the proportion of viruses bearing G614 on a country by country basis.\n\n The amino acid at position 614 occurs at an internal protein interface of the viral spike, and the presence of G at this position was calculated to destabilise a specific conformation of the viral spike, within which the key host receptor binding site is more accessible.\n\n\nConclusion\nThese results imply that G614 is a more pathogenic strain of SARS?CoV?2, which may influence vaccine design.\n\n The prevalence of this form of the

currently available about the immune target epitopes of novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) to induce host immune responses.\n Through a comprehensive bioinformatic screening of potential epitopes derived from the SARS-CoV-2 sequences for HLAs commonly present in the Japanese population, we identified 2013 and 1399 possible peptide epitopes that are likely to have the high affinity (&lt;0.5%- and

nucleocapsid proteins) and the nonstructural proteins (proteins corresponding to six open reading frames); however, we found several regions where high-affinity epitopes were significantly enriched.\n By comparing the sequences of these predicted T cell epitopes to the other coronaviruses, we identified 781 HLA-class I and 418 HLA-class II epitopes that have high homologies to SARS-CoV.\n To further select commonly-available epitopes that would be applicable to larger populations, we calculated population coverages based on the allele frequencies of HLA molecules, and found 2 HLA-class I

Most patients had lymphocytopenia on admission, with lymphocyte levels dropping progressively on the following days, and the more severe lymphopenia developed in the IMV group. In both groups, T lymphocyte counts were below typical lower limit norms compared to B lymphocytes. On admission, both groups had higher than expected amounts of plasma interleukin-6 (IL-6), which over time declined more in NIV patients. The prothrombin time was increased and the levels of platelet, hemoglobin, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), D-dimer, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and IL-6 were higher in IMV cases compared with NIV cases during hospitalization. Conclusions: Data showed that the rates of complications, dynamics of lymphocytopenia, and changes in levels of platelet, hemoglobin, BUN, D-dimer, LDH and IL-6, and prothrombin time in these ICU patients were significantly different between IMV and NIV cases.\nIntroduction\nIn December 2019, a series of patients became stricken with an acute respiratory illness of unknown cause, which has emerged in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China. Researchers now know these patients had coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) which has been classified in the beta-coronavirus 2b lineage. Within several months, this disease rapidly and widely spread in China and many other countries, causing an outbreak of COVID-19 worldwide.\nBy the end of April 2020, the cumulative number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 infections in China is more than 80 000 and includes more than 4000 deaths, according to the notification from the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China (NHC,). COVID-19 was the third lethal illness caused by a coronavirus, surpassed only by severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) (WHO,) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) (WHO,). About one third of COVID-19 inpatients were admitted to intensive care units (ICUs) in Wuhan, China (Huang et al.,) and doctors are recognizing that a critical ingredient in managing the impacts of the disease is effective treatment of severe and critical patients. Recent data (NHC,) showed that COVID-19 fatality rates in Hubei Province and outside of the province were significantly different, prompting researchers to seek more information about the characteristics and treatments of COVID-19 patients in ICUs. Deeper analyses of related data may help in developing more effective treatment protocols for future severe patients.\nHere we describe clinical and laboratory characteristics, treatments, and outcomes of confirmed COVID-19 patients who were admitted to the ICU of a tertiary teaching hospital in Hangzhou (Zhejiang Province, China), about 775 km from the outbreak city of Wuhan. The Department of Critical Care Medicine in this hospital is a key clinical center at the national level and regional critical diagnosis and treatment center in Zhejiang Province. During the dates studied, nine severe COVID-19 patients were transferred from surrounding cities to the regional hospital and represent the surrounding population at a regional level.\nSubjects and methods\nParticipants and study design\nFor this retrospective study, we analyzed data from patients admitted between Jan. 22 and Mar. 5, 2020, who had been diagnosed (according to the guidance of NHC) with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia in the ICU in the First Affiliated Hospital, School of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China. This ICU and hospital had been designated for COVID-19 treatment and written informed consent was obtained from all participants in the study. To be included in this analysis, patients' data had to meet one of the specific conditions for admission to ICU including dyspnea and respiratory rate of &gt;=30 times/min, oxygen saturation of &lt;=93% at rest without oxygen inhalation, PaO2/FiO2 (P/F) of &lt;=300 mmHg (1 mmHg=0.133 kPa), and other organ dysfunction such as shock.\nData collection\nTwo researchers independently reviewed patients' medical records during the period of study for epidemiological, demographic, clinical, laboratory, management, and outcome information. Disease onset was defined as the day that any related symptom was noticed by patients or family group members, as ascertained through researcher communications. Diagnoses were identified according to standard international definitions including: (1) acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS; Berlin definition) (Ranieri et al.,); (2) acute kidney injury (AKI; Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) Clinical Practice Guidelines) (Khwaja,); (3) acute liver injury defined as an increase in alanine aminotransferase (ALT) over two times the upper limit of the normal range (ULN) or an increase in conjugated bilirubin or a combined increase in aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alkaline phosphatase and total bilirubin provided that one of them was above two times ULN (Ferrer et al.,); (4) cardiac injury following the definition described by Huang et al..\nNoninvasive ventilation (NIV) included nasal oxygen therapy, mask oxygen inhalation, and high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC). We recorded the duration of disease onset to first positive nucleic acid testing of respiratory tract specimen, ICU admission, ARDS, HFNC, invasive positive pressure ventilation (IPPV), and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO).\nLaboratory confirmation and treatment\nUsing the hospital laboratory, we tested patient blood including complete blood count, serum biochemistry, coagulation profiles, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and C-reactive protein. Plasma cytokines from all patients (interleukin-2 (IL-2), IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma)) were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) method according to the manufacturer's instructions (Elabscience Biotechnology Co., Ltd., Wuhan, China). T, natural killer (NK), and B lymphocyte cell counts were tested by flow cytometry. Respiratory specimens of all patients including sputum, pharyngeal swabs, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, and bronchial aspirates were tested for SARS-CoV-2, using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assays (Huang et al.,).\nOnly one patient did not receive antiviral or systematic corticosteroid treatment. Thirty (88.2%) were given empirical antibiotic treatment, and 27 (79.4%) were given gamma-globulin treatment. Indications for HFNC included P/F of &lt;200 mmHg, resting respiratory rate of more than &gt;20 per minute, and the patient presenting as conscious and cooperative. The timing of invasive ventilation included P/F of &lt;150 mmHg, a resting respiratory rate of more than 30 per minute, and patients presenting as uncooperative, and/or onset of serious complications such as shock. Indications for ECMO (Brodie and Bacchetta,) included severe hypoxemia (e.g., P/F of &lt;80 mmHg, despite the application of high levels of positive end expiration pressure (typically 15-20 cmH2O (1 cmH2O=0.098 kPa)) for at least 6 h in patients with potentially reversible respiratory failure, uncompensated hypercapnia with acidemia (pH&lt;7.15) or excessively high end-inspiratory plateau pressure (&gt;35-45 cmH2O, according to the patient's body size) despite the best accepted standard of care for management with a ventilator.\nStatistical analysis\nWe compared clinical and laboratory data from the two groups. Continuous variables were described with medians in interquartile ranges (IQRs) and compared with the Mann-Whitney U test. Two sets of data at different time points were compared using a two-way repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA). Categorical variables were described using frequency rates and percentages and compared by chi2 test or Fisher's exact test. A two-sided alpha of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. All analyses were performed using SPSS software (Version 22.0). The patients in our cohort were divided into cases only receiving NIV and cases requiring invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV), because the way of respiratory support was independently associated with the process and outcome (Lindenauer et al.,; Gacouin et al.,).\nResults\nNone of the 34 patients included in this study was a resident of Wuhan City and none had direct exposure to the Huanan Seafood Market. Nine of the patients had been exposed to individuals with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection or clustering onset and 17 had traveled within the epidemic area or had close contact with one or more people from the epidemic area. Eight patients had no history of any of the above. Other characteristics of study patients include (Fig. 1): (1) median duration from symptom onset to the first positive nucleic acid test was 4 (1-7) d; (2) median duration from symptom onset to ICU admission was 10.0 (7.0-11.3) d; (3) median duration from symptom onset to HFNC was 10 (7-11) d in 27 patients; (4) median duration from onset to IMV was 11 (8-12) d in 15 patients; (5) median duration from symptom onset to ECMO was 23 (18-29) d in 11 patients; (6) median age was 66 (58-76) years and 23 (67.6%) were men; (7) 24 (70.6%) patients had chronic diseases including hypertension (64.7%), diabetes (23.5%), cardiovascular disease (11.8%), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (5.9%), chronic liver disease (11.8%), and chronic kidney disease (5.9%).\nTimeline of COVID-19 cases after onset of illness\nICU: intensive care unit; HFNC: high-flow nasal cannula; ECMO: extracorporeal membrane oxygenation; IMV: invasive mechanical ventilation\nThe most common symptoms at onset of illness (Table 1) were fever (58.8%), dry cough (20.6%), and expectoration (29.4%). Relatively less common initial symptoms were myalgia (14.7%), fatigue (5.9%), diarrhea (5.9%), and headache (5.9%). The proportion of different comorbidities and the distribution of first symptoms did not differ obviously.\nDemographics and baseline characteristics of patients with COVID-19\nCharacteristics	All cases (n=34)	IMV (n=15)	NIV (n=19)	P value (IMV vs. NIV)	 	Age (year)	66 (58, 76)	71 (60, 83)	66 (51, 72)	0.176	 	Sex	 	 Male	23 (67.6%)	11 (73.3%)	12 (63.2%)	0.715	 	 Female	11 (32.4%)	4 (26.7%)	7 (36.8%)	0.715	 	Comorbidities	 	 Any	24 (70.6%)	11 (73.3%)	13 (68.4%)	1.000	 	 Hypertension	22 (64.7%)	10 (66.7%)	12 (63.2%)	1.000	 	 Diabetes	8 (23.5%)	4 (26.7%)	4 (21.1%)	1.000	 	 Cardiovascular disease	4 (11.8%)	3 (20.0%)	1 (5.3%)	0.299	 	 COPD	2 (5.9%)	1 (6.7%)	1 (5.3%)	1.000	 	 Chronic liver disease	4 (11.8%)	1 (6.7%)	3 (15.8%)	0.613	 	 Chronic kidney disease	2 (5.9%)	1 (6.7%)	1 (5.3%)	1.000	 	Signs and symptoms	 	 Fever	20 (58.8%)	11 (73.3%)	9 (47.4%)	0.171	 	 Dry cough	7 (20.6%)	2 (13.3%)	5 (26.3%)	0.426	 	 Expectoration	10 (29.4%)	7 (46.7%)	3 (15.8%)	0.068	 	 Fatigue	2 (5.9%)	1 (6.7%)	1 (5.3%)	1.000	 	 Diarrhea	2 (5.9%)	0 (0.0%)	2 (10.5%)	0.492	 	 Myalgia	5 (14.7%)	2 (13.3%)	3 (15.8%)	1.000	 	 Headache	2 (5.9%)	2 (13.3%)	0 (0.0%)	0.187	 	Vital signs at ICU admission	 	 Temperature ( C)	37.3 (37.0, 38.0)	37.4 (37.0, 38.1)	37.2 (37.0, 38.0)	0.889	 	 Respiratory rate (min-1)	23 (19, 29)	25 (22, 32)	20 (16, 26)	0.060	 	 Heart rate (min-1)	79 (67, 88)	67 (62, 91)	80 (70, 87)	0.509	 	 MAP (mmHg)	89 (84, 99)	85 (81, 94)	94 (85, 100)	0.022	 	\nData are expressed as median (IQR) or number (percentage) of patients.

Lymphopenia (lymphocyte count less than 0.8x109 L-1, 22 (64.7%) patients) was present in more than half of the patients on admission. Platelet count in the NIV group was higher than that in the IMV group, which were in normal range in most patients of both groups. As shown in Table 2, no significant differences were found between the NIV and IMV groups in terms of other biochemical indexes, inflammation or immune indicators, or coagulation indices on admission to hospital.\nLaboratory findings in patients with COVID-19 on admission to hospital\nVariables	Normal range	All patients (n=34)	IMV (n=15)	NIV (n=19)	P value (IMV vs. NIV)	 	WBC count (x109 L-1)	4.0-10.0	8.9 (5.3, 14.3)	6.2 (4.4, 13.5)	9.3 (6.6, 16.0)	0.160	 	 &lt;4		2 (5.9%)	1 (6.7%)	1 (5.3%)	0.674	 	 4-10		17 (50.0%)	8 (53.3%)	9 (47.4%)	0.674	 	 &gt;10		15 (44.1%)	6 (40.0%)	9 (47.4%)	0.674	 	Neutrophil count (x109 L-1)	2.0-7.0	7.8 (4.3, 13.2)	5.7 (3.6, 12.8)	8.0 (5.5, 14.8)	0.223	 	Lymphocyte count (x109 L-1)	0.8-4.0	0.6 (0.5, 0.9)	0.5 (0.4, 0.8)	0.6 (0.5, 0.9)	0.539	 	 &lt;0.8		22 (64.7%)	10 (66.7%)	12 (63.2%)	1.000	 	 &gt;=0.8		12 (35.3%)	5 (33.3%)	7 (36.8%)	1.000	 	Platelet count (x109 L-1)	101-320	178 (147, 196)	156 (111, 176)	191 (172, 201)	0.012	 	ALT (U/L)	7-40	20 (15, 30)	21 (14, 31)	19 (15, 27)	0.768	 	Total bilirubin (mumol/L)	0.0-21.0	12.0 (7.6, 18.6)	11.8 (7.3, 18.5)	12.1 (8.0, 18.7)	0.876	 	BUN (mmol/L)	3.1-8.8	7.0 (5.4, 10.5)	7.5 (6.0, 14.2)	6.6 (5.0, 8.1)	0.111	 	Creatinine (mumol/L)	41-81	84 (67, 104)	84 (67, 106)	84 (67, 99)	0.445	 	C-reactive protein (mg/L)	0-8	48 (27, 88)	50 (39, 52)	46 (27, 103)	0.986	 	D-dimer (mg/L)	0-700	606 (383, 1109)	675 (433, 1613)	467 (370, 1073)	0.405	 	IL-6 (pg/mL)	0-7	47 (24, 81)	65 (38, 202)	38 (12, 72)	0.054	 	IL-10 (pg/mL)	0.0-2.3	6.7 (4.4, 9.0)	7.0 (5.2, 9.7)	5.5 (3.1, 8.8)	0.258	 	\nData are expressed as median (IQR) or number (percentage) of patients.

Fifteen (44.1%) received IMV and 11 (32.4%) patients required ECMO. Five (14.7%) patients required continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT). Common complications among the 34 ICU patients included ARDS (33 (97.1%)), acute liver injury (14 (41.2%)), acute cardiac injury (13 (38.2%)), and AKI (7 (20.6%)). Table 3 shows that the complication rates (including acute cardiac injury and AKI) were significantly higher and discharge rate was notably lower in IMV than in NIV patients.\nTreatments, complications, and outcomes in patients with COVID-19 during hospitalization\nParameter	All cases (n=34)	IMV (n=15)	NIV (n=19)	P value (IMV vs. NIV)	 	Treatments	 	 Antiviral therapy	33 (97.1%)	15 (100.0%)	18 (94.7%)	0.5590	 	 Glucocorticoid therapy	33 (97.1%)	15 (100.0%)	18 (94.7%)	0.5590	 	 Antibiotics	30 (88.2%)	15 (100.0%)	15 (78.9%)	0.0840	 	 gamma-Globulin	27 (79.4%)	14 (93.3%)	13 (68.4%)	0.0850	 	 HFNC	18 (52.9%)	0 (0.0%)	18 (94.7%)	&lt;0.0001	 	 IMV	15 (44.1%)	15 (100.0%)	0 (0.0%)	&lt;0.0001	 	 ECMO	11 (32.4%)	11 (73.3%)	0 (0.0%)	&lt;0.0001	 	 CRRT	5 (14.7%)	4 (26.7%)	1 (5.3%)	0.1040	 	Complications	 	 ARDS	33 (97.1%)	15 (100.0%)	18 (94.7%)	0.5590	 	 AKI	7 (20.6%)	6 (40.0%)	1 (5.3%)	0.0190	 	 Acute liver injury	14 (41.2%)	9 (60.0%)	5 (26.3%)	0.0510	 	 Acute cardiac injury	13 (38.2%)	10 (66.7%)	3 (15.8%)	0.0030	 	Outcomes	 	 Discharge	20 (58.8%)	2 (13.3%)	18 (94.7%)	&lt;0.0001	 	 Death	0 (0.0%)	0 (0.0%)	0 (0.0%)	1.0000	 	\nData are expressed as number (percentage) of patients.

White blood cell counts and neutrophil counts were at high levels during hospitalization, but for NIV patients were declining at the time of discharge. During hospitalization, most patients had marked lymphopenia, with IMV patients developing more severe lymphopenia over time. However, lymphocytes had returned to normal levels in NIV cases by the discharge day. Flow cytometry showed that median T lymphocyte counts were less than one third of the lower normal limit, compared to B lymphocytes in inpatients. T lymphocyte counts stayed low during hospitalization; however, the counts gradually rose to normal level until discharge in nearly half of NIV patients.\nNK cell counts in more than 75% of patients were below the lower normal limit, and the counts declined progressively in IMV cases rather than in NIV cases during hospitalization. Platelet counts and hemoglobin levels were higher in NIV cases than in IMV cases, and hemoglobin levels dropped progressively in IMV cases during hospitalization. C-reactive protein levels in both groups showed gradual downward trend during hospitalization. ALT and D-dimer levels showed upward trends in both groups during hospitalization, while, for total bilirubin and blood urea nitrogen (BUN), the upward trends only occurred in IMV cases. The progressive decreases in LDH, IL-6, and IL-10 levels occurred in NIV cases rather than in IMV cases during hospitalization. The prothrombin time was increased, and BUN, D-dimer, LDH, and IL-6 levels were higher in IMV cases compared with NIV cases during hospitalization (Figs. 2 and 3).\nLaboratory parameters (complete blood count and CRP) in 34 patients with COVID-19 (19 NIV cases and 15 IMV cases) every other day based on the days after admission\nThe dotted lines show the lower normal limits in lymphocyte, T lymphocyte, B lymphocyte, natural killer cell, and haemoglobin, and show the upper normal limit in CRP.

Of the 34 patients, 19 patients (55.9%) received noninvasive respiratory support (including nasal oxygen therapy in one case and HFNC in 18 patients) and 15 (44.1%) required IMV. By Mar. 5, 2020, the rates of complications (e.g., acute liver, kidney, or cardiac injury) and discharge rates were significantly different between these two groups (a notable and positive outcome is that the oldest patient, a 94 years old man, was successfully treated and discharged).\nMore than 100 COVID-19 patients were admitted to the First Affiliated Hospital during our study period. Patients housed in the general isolation ward had mild to moderate symptoms, and as of Mar. 5, 2020, most ICU patients who did not require IMV have recovered and been discharged. However, by the end of Mar. 5, 2020, the majority of ICU patients requiring IMV are still receiving respiratory support including 11 patients who continue to require ECMO treatment. The high proportion of patients needing support in an ICU strongly suggests that a critical component to effectively fight COVID-19 and to protect the population will be to improve the management and treatment of severe and critical patients in hospital ICUs. This focus on effective hospital treatment for the critically ill is particularly important now because despite some progresses being made, to date no antiviral treatment has been proven to be effective for coronavirus infection.\nIn this study, the most common complication in patients was ARDS (33 (97.1%) of 34 patients), underscoring the critical role of respiratory support in recovery. In this cohort, 33 infected patients received single or combined antiviral drugs including lopinavir/ritonavir, baloxavir, favipiravir, darunavir, arbidol, and interferon-alpha inhalation. Corticosteroid and gamma-globulin were administrated to about 80% of patients, but the efficacy of this treatment needs to be further confirmed.\nMost patients in our cohort had neutrophilia, which is consistent with the results of SARS-CoV-infected patients as described by Wong et al.. As mentioned in previous studies, for critically ill patients with SARS-CoV (Gu et al.,), SARS-CoV-2 (Yang et al.,), and MERS (Chu et al.,; Liu et al.,) infection, lymphocytopenia is a prominent feature, indicating that targeted invasion by viral particles causes lymphocyte destruction. At admission to the hospital, 60% of the patients in our study already had lymphocytopenia and other patients in the study developed the condition as the disease progressed. In the IMV group, those with more severe illness, lymphocyte levels dropped progressively, and more severe lymphopenia occurred compared to the NIV group, suggesting that the severity of lymphocytopenia reflects the severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Research of SARS-CoV suggests that patients with more severe clinical illness and those who died had significantly more profound lymphopenia (He et al.,). In our cohort, the lymphocyte counts in patients gradually rose as they recovered and were normal at time of discharge in the NIV group. These results differ from those of patients with SARS-CoV, in which lymphopenia was prolonged and lymphocyte levels did not return toward normal until patients were ill for five weeks (He et al.,). Our findings also differ from those of patients with H1N1 influenza A infection whose lymphocyte levels did not return to normal until 2-3 weeks after the disease onset (Cheng et al.,). Further analysis in our cohort showed that T lymphocytopenia was more pronounced than B lymphocytopenia, which was similar to previous study in SARS patients (Cui et al.,). The mechanism behind these dynamics is not clear and calls for further study and confirmation in cell and animal experiments.\nWe noted that SARS-CoV-2 infection caused increase in plasma IL-6 level, which was consistently at a high level in IMV cases in our cohort. Early studies also have shown increased concentrations of proinflammatory cytokines (e.g., IL-6, TNF-alpha, and IFN-gamma) in SARS (Wong et al.,) and MERS-CoV (Mahallawi et al.,) cases. Increased levels of anti-inflammatory cytokine, IL-10, in plasma were found in SARS-CoV-2-infected patients with IMV, which differed from SARS-CoV infection (Wong et al.,) but was supported by Huang et al. in patients with the same disease. BUN is a key element reflecting the intricate interrelation between nutritional status, protein metabolism, and renal situation of the patient (Arihan et al.,). BUN was significantly elevated in IMV patients compared with NIV cases, which may be caused by high catabolism. The characteristics of inflammation and metabolism suggested that we have to be on the alert of the existence of persistent inflammation-immunosuppression and catabolism syndrome (PICS) in COVID-19 patients with prolonged mechanical ventilation. PICS, often leading to secondary infections and viral reactivation in the critically ill, has been associated with increased morbidity and mortality (Limaye et al.,; Kalil and Florescu,; Libert et al.,).\nThe baseline characteristics (including age, sex, and comorbidities) and laboratory indexes of patients in our cohort showed no statistical difference. However, the cases developed into different conditions needing different oxygen therapies and were complicated by injury to different organs impacting the probabilities and specifics of disease progression. Whether or not there are correlations or causal relationships among viral loads, lymphocytopenia, IMV, and organ injury remains to be verified by future research.\nThis study has several limitations. First, we had limited samples from our cohort to analyze and in places outside Hubei Province, and the total number of cases and the number of critical patients were relatively small, also limiting available samples to study. A previous report enrolled 52 critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection from Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital (Yang et al.,). Second, at the time of this writing, 13 IMV patients had not been discharged, so we cannot use survival or death as a clinical end point. The case mortality rate and other outcome indicators need to be reported later.\nConclusions\nIn this single-center case series of 34 ICU patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection in Hangzhou, China, 97.1% (33 cases) of patients had complications caused by ARDS, 44.1% (15) received IMV, 55.9% (19) only needed noninvasive respiratory support. Compared with cases in the NIV group, patients receiving IMV more readily developed complications from organ injury, had higher inflammatory markers, and developed more severe lymphopenia.\nProject supported by the Project for Emergency of Key R&amp;D Plan from Zhejiang Science and Technology Agency (No. 2020C03123), China\nContributors: Hong-liu CAI and Yi ZHENG conceived and designed the study, drafted the paper, and took responsibility for the integrity of the data and the accuracy of the data analysis.

Association of admission BUN and both intra-hospital and long-term mortality were investigated by Cox regression.\n\n An optimal cut-off was calculated by means of the Youden-Index.\n\n\nResults\nPatients with higher admission BUN concentration were older, clinically sicker and had more pronounced laboratory signs of multi-organ failure including kidney failure.\n\n Admission BUN was associated with adverse long-term mortality (HR 1.013; 95%CI 1.012–1.014; p&lt;0.001).\n\n An optimal cut-off was calculated at 28 mg/dL which was associated with adverse outcome

the lack of infection","abstract":"Fatal outcomes of Ebola virus (EBOV) infections are typically preceded by a ‘sepsis-like’ syndrome and lymphopenia despite T cells being resistant to Ebola infection.\n The mechanisms that lead to T lymphocytes death remain largely unknown; however, the degree of lymphopenia is highly correlative with fatalities.\n Here we investigated whether the addition of EBOV or its envelope glycoprotein (GP) to isolated primary human CD4+ T cells induced cell death.\n We observed a significant decrease in cell viability in a GP-dependent manner, which is suggestive of a direct role of GP in T cell death.\n Using immunoprecipitation assays and flow cytometry, we demonstrate that EBOV directly binds to CD4+ T cells through interaction of GP with TLR4. Transcriptome analysis revealed that the addition of EBOV to CD4+ T cells results in the significant upregulation of pathways associated with interferon signaling, pattern recognition receptors and intracellular activation of NF?B signaling pathway.\n Both transcriptome analysis and specific inhibitors allowed identification of apoptosis and necrosis as mechanisms associated with the observed T cell death following exposure to EBOV.\n The addition of the TLR4 inhibitor CLI-095 significantly reduced CD4+ T cell death induced by GP.\n EBOV stimulation of primary CD4+ T cells resulted in a significant increase in secreted TNF?; inhibition of TNF?-mediated signaling events significantly reduced T cell death while inhibitors of both necrosis and apoptosis similarly reduced EBOV-induced T cell death.\n Lastly, we show that stimulation with EBOV or GP augments monocyte maturation as determined by an overall increase in expression levels of markers of differentiation.\n Subsequently, the increased rates of cellular differentiation resulted in higher rates of infection further contributing to T cell death.\n These results demonstrate that GP directly subverts the host’s immune response by increasing the susceptibility of monocytes to EBOV infection and triggering lymphopenia through direct and indirect mechanisms.\n","id":"PMC5456411","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Public Library of

Shanghai, China","abstract":"Background\nThe novel avian influenza H7N9 virus has caused severe diseases in humans in eastern China since the spring of 2013. On January 18th 2014, a doctor working in the emergency department of a hospital in Shanghai died of H7N9 virus infection.\n\n To understand possible reasons to explain this world’s first fatal H7N9 case of a health care worker (HCW), we summarize the clinical presentation, epidemiological investigations, laboratory results, and prevention and control policies and make important recommendations to hospital-related workers.\n\n\nCase presentation\nThe patient was a 31-year-old male Chinese surgeon who was obese and had a five-year history of hypertension and suspected diabetes.\n\n On January 11th 2014, he showed symptoms of an influenza-like illness.\n\n Four days later, his illness rapidly progressed with bilateral pulmonary infiltration, hypoxia and lymphopenia.\n\n On January 17th, the case had a high fever, productive cough, chest tightness and shortness of breath, so that he was administered with oseltamivir, glucocorticoid, immunoglobulin, and broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy.\n\n The case died in the early morning of next day after invasive ventilation.\n\n He had no contact with poultry nor had he visited live-poultry markets (LPMs), where positive rates of H7N9 were 14.6 % and 18.5 %.\n\n Before his illness, he cared for three febrile patients and had indirect contact with one severe pneumonia patient.\n\n Follow-up with 35 close contacts identified two HCWs who had worked also in emergency department but had not worn masks were anti-H7N9-positive.\n\n Viral sequence identity percentages between the patient and two LPM-H7N9 isolates were fewer than between the patient and another human case in shanghai in January of 2014.\nConclusions\nImportant reasons for the patient’s death might include late treatment with oseltamivir, and the infected H7N9 virus carrying both mammalian-adapted signature (HA-Q226L) and aerosol transmissibility (PB2-D701N).\n\n The LPM he passed every day was an unlikely source of his infection, but a contaminated environment, or an unidentified mild/asymptomatic H7N9 carrier were more probable.\n\n We advocate rigorous standard operating procedures for infection control practices in hospital settings and evaluations thereafter.\n\n\n","id":"PMC4476082","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"BioMed

Of six family members who travelled to Wuhan, five were identified as infected with the novel coronavirus.\n\n Additionally, one family member, who did not travel to Wuhan, became infected with the virus after several days of contact with four of the family members.\n\n None of the family members had contacts with Wuhan markets or animals, although two had visited a Wuhan hospital.\n\n Five family members (aged 36–66 years) presented with fever, upper or lower respiratory tract symptoms, or diarrhoea, or a combination of these 3–6 days after exposure.\n\n They presented to our hospital (The University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen) 6–10 days after symptom onset.\n\n They and one asymptomatic child (aged 10 years) had radiological ground-glass lung opacities.\n\n Older patients (aged &gt;60 years) had more systemic symptoms, extensive radiological ground-glass lung changes, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and increased C-reactive protein and lactate dehydrogenase levels.\n\n The nasopharyngeal or throat swabs of these six patients were negative for known respiratory microbes by point-of-care multiplex RT-PCR, but five patients (four adults and the child) were RT-PCR positive for genes encoding the internal RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and surface Spike protein of this novel coronavirus, which were confirmed by Sanger sequencing.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these five patients' RT-PCR amplicons and two full genomes by next-generation sequencing showed that this is a novel coronavirus, which is closest to the bat severe acute respiatory syndrome

outcomes in patients with a number of different malignancies.\n\n The objective of this study was to assess the relationship between NLR and mortality in a population of adult critically ill patients.\n\n\nMethods\nWe performed an observational cohort study of unselected intensive care unit (ICU) patients based on records in a large clinical database.\n\n We computed individual patient NLR and categorized patients by quartile of this ratio.\n\n The association of NLR quartiles and 28-day mortality was assessed using multivariable logistic regression.\n\n Secondary outcomes included mortality in the ICU, in-hospital mortality and 1-year mortality.\n\n An a priori subgroup analysis of patients with versus without sepsis was performed to assess any differences in the relationship between the NLR and outcomes in these cohorts.\n\n\nResults\nA total of 5,056 patients were included.\n\n Their 28-day mortality rate was 19%.\n\n The median age of the cohort was 65 years, and 47% were female.\n\n The median NLR for the entire cohort was 8.9 (interquartile range, 4.99 to 16.21).\n\n Following multivariable adjustments, there was a stepwise increase in mortality with increasing quartiles of NLR (first quartile: reference category; second quartile odds ratio (OR) = 1.32; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.03 to 1.71; third quartile OR = 1.43; 95% CI, 1.12 to 1.83; 4th quartile OR = 1.71; 95% CI, 1.35 to 2.16).\n\n A similar stepwise relationship was identified in the subgroup of patients who presented without sepsis.\n\n The NLR was not associated with 28-day mortality in patients with sepsis.\n\n Increasing quartile of NLR was statistically significantly associated with secondary outcome.\n\n\nConclusion\nThe NLR is associated with outcomes in unselected critically

a major threat to public health1–3.\n Despite intense research efforts, how, when and where new diseases appear are still a source of considerable uncertainty.\n A severe respiratory disease was recently reported in Wuhan, Hubei province, China.\n As of 25 January 2020, at least 1,975 cases had been reported since the first patient was hospitalized on 12 December 2019. Epidemiological investigations have suggested that the outbreak was associated with a seafood market in Wuhan.\n Here we study a single patient who was a worker at the market and who was admitted to the Central Hospital of Wuhan on 26 December 2019 while experiencing a severe respiratory syndrome that included fever, dizziness and a cough.\n Metagenomic RNA sequencing4 of a sample of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from the patient identified a new RNA virus strain from the family Coronaviridae, which is designated here ‘WH-Human 1’ coronavirus (and has also been referred to as ‘2019-nCoV’).\n Phylogenetic analysis of the complete viral genome (29,903 nucleotides) revealed that the virus was most closely related (89.1% nucleotide similarity) to a group of SARS-like

reactivation on morbidity and mortality is still controversial.\n\n Therefore, we analyzed the incidence and impact of CMV reactivation on outcome in patients with severe sepsis.\n\n\nMethods\nIn a prospective longitudinal double-blinded observational study, 97 adult nonimmunosuppressed CMV-seropositive patients with new onset of severe sepsis were included.\n\n Leukocytes, plasma and tracheal secretions were examined weekly for CMV-DNA by PCR.\n\n Tracheal secretions were additionally tested for HSV (Herpes Simplex Virus)-DNA.\n\n The influence of CMV-reactivation on the endpoints was analysed by Cox proportional-hazard regression analysis.\n\n Time-dependency was evaluated by landmark analysis.\n\n\nResults\nSix out 97 died and five were discharged from the hospital within 72 hours and were excluded of the analysis.\n\n CMV reactivation occurred in 35 of the 86 (40.69%) analysed patients.\n\n HSV infection occurred in 23 of the 35 (65.7%) CMV reactivators.\n\n In 10 patients CMV-plasma-DNAemia appeared with a DNA-content below 600 copies/ml in four cases and a peak amount of 2,830 copies/ml on average.\n\n In patients with and without CMV reactivation mortality rates were similar (37.1% vs.\n\n 35.3%, P = 0.861), respectively.\n\n However, in the multivariate COX regression analyses CMV reactivation was independently associated with increased length of stay in the ICU (30.0, interquartile range 14 to 48 vs.\n\n 12.0, interquartile range 7 to 19 days; HR (hazard ratio) 3.365; 95% CI (confidence interval) 1.233 to 9.183, P = 0.018) and in the hospital (33.0, interquartile range 24 to 62 vs.\n\n 16.0, interquartile range 10 to 24 days, HR 3.3, 95% CI 1.78 to 6.25, P &lt; 0.001) as well as prolonged mechanical ventilation (22.0, interquartile range 6

interquartile range 1 to 7, days in reactivators vs.\n\n non-reactivators, P = 0.038).\n\n HSV reactivation proved not to be a risk factor for these adverse effects.\n\n\nConclusions\nThese data indicate an independent correlation between CMV reactivation and increased morbidity in the well-defined group of nonimmunosuppressed patients with severe sepsis, but CMV reactivation had no impact on mortality in this group with low CMV-DNA plasma levels.\n\n Thus, the potential harms and benefits of antiviral treatment have to be weighed cautiously in patients with severe sepsis or septic

elevated, they may contribute to morbidity and mortality.\n This study determined if reactivation of herpesviruses, polyomaviruses, and the anellovirus TTV occurred in sepsis and correlated with severity.\n Serial whole blood and plasma samples from 560 critically-ill septic, 161 critically-ill non-septic, and 164 healthy age-matched patients were analyzed by quantitative-polymerase-chain-reaction for cytomegalovirus (CMV), Epstein-Barr (EBV), herpes-simplex (HSV), human herpes virus-6 (HHV-6), and TTV.\n Polyomaviruses BK and JC were quantitated in

markedly increased frequency of detectable virus.\n Cumulative viral DNA detection rates in blood were: CMV (24.2%), EBV (53.2%), HSV (14.1%), HHV-6 (10.4%), and TTV (77.5%).\n 42.7% of septic

shock trials: a systematic analysis of population characteristics and control-group mortality rates","abstract":"Purpose\nid='Par1'>Although the definition of septic shock has been standardized, some variation in mortality rates among clinical trials is expected.\n\n Insights into the sources of heterogeneity may influence the design and interpretation of septic shock studies.\n\n We set out to identify inclusion criteria and baseline characteristics associated with between-trial differences in control group mortality rates.\n\n\nMethods\nid='Par2'>We conducted a systematic review of RCTs published between 2006 and 2018 that included patients with septic shock.\n\n The percentage of variance in control-group mortality attributable to study heterogeneity rather than chance was measured by I2.\n\n The association between control-group mortality and population characteristics was estimated using linear mixed models and a recursive partitioning algorithm.\n\n\nResults\nid='Par3'>Sixty-five septic shock RCTs were included.\n\n Overall control-group mortality was 38.6%, with significant heterogeneity (I2 = 93%, P &lt; 0.0001) and a 95% prediction interval of 13.5–71.7%.\n\n The mean mortality rate did not differ between trials with different definitions of hypotension, infection or vasopressor or mechanical ventilation inclusion criteria.\n\n Population characteristics univariately associated with mortality rates were mean Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score (standardized regression coefficient (?) = 0.57, P = 0.007), mean serum creatinine (? = 0.48, P = 0.007), the proportion of patients on mechanical ventilation (? = 0.61, P &lt; 0.001), and the proportion with vasopressors (? = 0.57, P = 0.002).\n\n Combinations of population characteristics selected with a linear model and recursive partitioning explained 41 and 42%, respectively, of the heterogeneity in mortality rates.\n\n\nConclusions\nid='Par4'>Among 65 septic shock trials, there was a clinically relevant amount of heterogeneity in control group mortality rates which was explained only partly by differences in inclusion criteria and reported baseline characteristics.\n\n\nElectronic supplementary material\nThe online version of this article (10.1007/s00134-018-5134-8) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized

coronaviruses still pose a continuous threat to human health, as exemplified by the recent emergence of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) in humans.\n The work on SARS-CoV widens our knowledge on the epidemiology, pathophysiology and immunology of coronaviruses and may shed light on MERS coronavirus (MERS-CoV).\n It has been confirmed that T-cell immunity plays an important role in recovery from SARS-CoV infection.\n Herein, we summarize T-cell immunological studies of SARS-CoV and discuss the potential cross-reactivity of the SARS-CoV-specific immunity against MERS-CoV, which may

Demographic data, symptoms, laboratory values, comorbidities, treatments, and clinical outcomes were all collected.\n\n Data were compared between survivors and non-survivors.\n\n The primary outcome was 28-day mortality, as of Feb 9, 2020. Secondary outcomes included incidence of SARS-CoV-2-related acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and the proportion of patients requiring mechanical ventilation.\n\n\nFindings\nOf 710 patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, 52 critically ill adult patients were included.\n\n The mean age of the 52 patients was 59·7 (SD 13·3) years, 35 (67%) were men, 21 (40%) had chronic illness, 51 (98%) had fever.\n\n 32 (61·5%) patients had died at 28 days, and the median duration from admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) to death was 7 (IQR 3–11) days for non-survivors.\n\n Compared with survivors, non-survivors were older (64·6 years [11·2] vs 51·9 years [12·9]), more likely to develop ARDS (26 [81%] patients vs 9 [45%] patients), and more likely to receive mechanical ventilation (30 [94%] patients vs 7 [35%] patients), either invasively or non-invasively.\n\n Most patients had organ function damage, including 35 (67%) with ARDS, 15 (29%) with acute kidney injury, 12 (23%) with cardiac injury, 15 (29%) with liver dysfunction, and one (2%) with pneumothorax.\n\n 37 (71%) patients required mechanical ventilation.\n\n Hospital-acquired infection occurred in seven (13·5%) patients.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe mortality of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia is considerable.\n\n The survival time of the non-survivors is likely to be within 1–2 weeks after ICU
