Ultraviolet germicidal irradiation (UVGI) is one possible method for respirator disinfection. However, UV radiation degrades polymers, which presents the possibility that UVGI exposure could degrade the ability of a disposable respirator to protect the worker. To study this, we exposed both sides of material coupons and respirator straps from four models of N95 FFRs to UVGI doses from 120-950 J/cm2. We then tested the particle penetration, flow resistance, and bursting strengths of the individual respirator coupon layers, and the breaking strength of the respirator straps. We found that UVGI exposure led to a small increase in particle penetration (up to 1.25%) and had little effect on the flow resistance. UVGI exposure had a more pronounced effect on the strengths of the respirator materials. At the higher UVGI doses, the strength of the layers of respirator material was substantially reduced (in some cases, by &gt;90%). The changes in the strengths of the respirator materials varied considerably among the different models of respirators. UVGI had less of an effect on the respirator straps; a dose of 2360 J/cm2 reduced the breaking strength of the straps by 20-51%. Our results suggest that UVGI could be used to effectively disinfect disposable respirators for reuse, but the maximum number of disinfection cycles will be limited by the respirator model and the UVGI dose required to inactivate the pathogen.\nINTRODUCTION\nThe possibility of a global pandemic of an infectious respiratory disease is of tremendous concern to the occupational health community, because healthcare workers would face the greatest risk of exposure. For pandemic diseases that may be transmitted by airborne particles, the isolation precaution guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) call for healthcare workers to wear respiratory protection while treating patients.() Because of their loose fit and low filtration capacity, surgical masks do not provide respiratory protection from small airborne particles.() For this reason, the most common respiratory protection device used in healthcare settings is the disposable N95 filtering facepiece respirator (FFR). However, infection control procedures typically call for disposable FFRs to be discarded after a single use to avoid cross-contamination. This means that a pandemic of a disease such as influenza would require a tremendous number of FFRs to protect healthcare workers from airborne transmission. The Institute of Medicine (IOM) projected that a 6-week influenza pandemic would require 90 million FFRs.() The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has predicted that an influenza pandemic would likely last 24 weeks, which suggests that up to 360 million FFRs could be needed in the United States alone.() A surge in demand of this magnitude would greatly exceed current stockpiles and production capabilities, and would almost certainly result in a shortage.\nOne possible way to meet the need for FFRs during a pandemic would be to reuse them,() since even a small number of reuses would greatly expand the available pool of disposable respirators. During the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, the CDC recommended that healthcare facilities consider extending the use of and reusing N95 respirators if necessary.() However, a significant concern with reuse is the possibility that the external surfaces of the respirator will become contaminated with infectious material and lead to disease transmission if, for example, a worker touches the respirator surface while re-donning it. To avoid this, FFRs would need to be decontaminated after each use. The IOM determined that no effective decontamination strategy existed for disposable respirators and recommended that this be explored.()\nA variety of techniques for decontaminating N95 respirators have been tested, including autoclaving, steam generated by heat or microwaves, ethylene oxide, vaporized hydrogen peroxide, and bleach.() All of these techniques have advantages and disadvantages. Heat and steam can melt or degrade the respirator and require drying the FFR after treatment.() Chemical disinfectants require rinsing and drying, and can leave an unpleasant odor or a residue that irritates the skin.() Gaseous systems using ethylene oxide or vaporized hydrogen peroxide require specialized equipment and ventilation controls.() N95 respirators cannot be disinfected with alcohols such as isopropanol because alcohols remove the electrostatic charge from the filtration media and substantially degrade its filtration capacity.()\nDisposable respirators also can be decontaminated through the use of ultraviolet germicidal irradiation (UVGI). UVGI uses ultraviolet light to inactivate microorganisms, primarily by cross-linking thymidine nucleotides in DNA and uracil nucleotides in RNA, which blocks replication.() UVGI systems are relatively quick and easy to use, and do not leave chemical residues or risk exposing workers to toxic chemicals. In the lab, UVGI has been successfully used to decontaminate N95 respirators exposed to the bacteriophage MS2 () and influenza virus.()\nAn important consideration for all decontamination methods, including UVGI, is the risk that they will degrade the respirator material, and in particular that they will reduce the ability of the respirator to filter out infectious bioaerosols. This is especially a concern with UVGI, as UV radiation degrades polymers, which are used in the construction of disposable FFRs. Some studies have looked at the effects of UVGI on respirator appearance, fit, airflow resistance, and filtration efficiency after one to three decontamination cycles and have found no significant effects.() However, the effects of extended exposures to UVGI after multiple decontamination cycles are not known, and it is unclear how large a cumulative dose of UVGI respirators can withstand, what damage eventually occurs, or how many times disposable FFRs could potentially be decontaminated and reused.\nThe purpose of this project was to study the effects of UVGI on the filtration performance and structural integrity of N95 respirators. By measuring the amount of UVGI to which respirators could be exposed before degrading, the maximum number of decontamination cycles to which disposable FFRs could be exposed can be determined, and concerns about possible loss of aerosol filtration efficiency can be examined. The results of this study will assist in the evaluation of UVGI as a potential method for FFR decontamination and in the design of systems and procedures for decontaminating respirators during a pandemic.\nMETHODS\nSummary\nCircular coupons were punched from N95 respirators and tested to determine their filter penetration (the fraction of aerosol particles that are not removed from the air stream and thus pass through the respirator material) and their flow resistance (the amount of air pressure required for air to flow through the respirator material at a given flow rate). Both sides of the coupons were exposed to UVGI and their filter penetration and flow resistance were tested again. The layers of the coupons were then separated and the bursting strength of each layer was determined. Straps were removed from respirators, both sides were exposed to UVGI, and their maximum tensile strengths were measured.\nRespirators\nFour models of N95 FFRs were selected for our experiments from those contained in the Strategic National Stockpile maintained by the CDC for use during public health emergencies. The models used were the 1860 N95 respirator/surgical mask (referred to as the 3M 1860; 3M, St. Paul, MN), the 9210 N95 respirator (referred to as the 3M 9210; 3M), the 1730 N95 respirator/surgical mask (referred to as the GE 1730; Gerson, Middleboro, MA), and the 46727 N95 respirator/surgical mask (referred to as the KC 46727; Kimberly-Clark, Roswell, GA). All respirators of each model were from the same lot number. For testing, 3-4 circular 37 mm coupons were punched from each respirator sample to obtain a total of 24 coupons for each respirator model. Four test coupons from each respirator model were tested under each exposure condition. The coupons were loaded into holders composed of two middle ring sections from three-piece polystyrene 37 mm filter cassettes (Part# 225-3250, SKC, Eighty-four, PA). The holders were then wrapped with black vinyl tape. This arrangement left both sides of the test coupon uncovered so that they could be exposed to UV irradiation. Two straps were cut from each respirator for exposure and testing: one strap was used as a control while the other was exposed.\nFilter Penetration and Flow Resistance\nParticle penetration vs. UVGI exposure for respirator material.

The fraction of aerosol particles that passed through the respirator coupon was measured sequentially using NaCl particles with diameters of 0.02, 0.03, 0.04, 0.05, 0.06, 0.08, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, and 0.4 mum. The maximum of these values was defined as the filter penetration. The flow resistance was determined by measuring the pressure drop of the airflow across the coupon. All tests were performed at an air flow rate of 5 l/min.     \nUVGI Exposure\nRespirator coupons and straps were exposed to ultraviolet light with a primary wavelength of 254 nm (UV-C) in a custom-made 91 cm x 31 cm x 64 cm high chamber. The chamber was fitted with two 15 Watt T-150 254 nm UV-C lamps in a reflective housing and lined with black felt to minimize reflections. UV-C irradiance was measured using a radiometer (ILT-1700, International Light Technologies, Peabody, MA). Eight respirator coupons were placed on a horizontal surface so that the coupons and the sensor were approximately 6.2 cm below the lamps. A section of filter cassette was attached to the sensor head of the radiometer so that the irradiation of the sensor head would match that of the coupons. Calibration measurements using the radiometer showed that the irradiance of the eight positions varied by no more than +-4%. Samples were also rotated once among the positions when they were flipped so that the mean exposures for the different groups were within +-0.1% of each other. The respirator coupons were exposed to 0, 120, 240, 470, or 950 J/cm2 of UV-C on each side (one side was exposed at a time). To expose the respirator straps, eight straps were laid side-by-side horizontally on a support surface at the same height as the sensor and each side was exposed to 0, 590, 1180, or 2360 J/cm2 in a similar manner to the coupons. Temperature and humidity in the chamber were monitored using a humidity and temperature transmitter (HMT330, Vaisala, Helsinki, Finland). The mean temperature during coupon exposures was 27 C (SD 1.7) and the mean relative humidity was 25% (SD 6.5). The exposure system was controlled using a custom-written computer program (LabVIEW 2013, National Instruments, Austin, TX).\nStrength Measurements of Respirator Coupons and Straps\nAfter the final filtration tests, the respirator coupons were removed from the filter cassettes and separated into layers as described previously.() The 3M 1860, 3M 9210, and the Gerson 1730 had three layers each, while the Kimberly-Clark 46727 had four layers. The layers were tested separately because some layers are much stronger than others in the same respirator, and changes in some layers might be masked by other layers. In addition, the UVGI dose received by the outer and innermost layers is higher than the middle layers because of attenuation. Analyzing the layers separately therefore provided better information on the effects of UVGI on the material. The bursting strength of each layer was measured using a half-scale version of the fixture described in ASTM Standard D3787() mounted in a materials testing machine (Model 5569A, Instron, Norwood, MA). Each coupon layer was clamped in a ring-shaped holder with a 22 mm central hole and rounded edges. A 12.7 mm polished steel ball was pushed through the material at a traverse rate of 2.5 mm/sec and the maximum force before failure was recorded. The respirator straps were clamped in the materials testing machine after UVGI exposure and stretched at a traverse rate of 5 mm/sec until breaking.\nAnalysis of Results\nThe experimental data were analyzed using SAS software (SAS Institute, Cary, NC). Data for each respirator were evaluated separately. To determine if there was any difference in penetration or flow resistance before and after UVGI irradiation, a randomized Complete Block Design model was fitted using the PROC MIXED procedure with the respirator type included as a random effect. Analyses for differences in the burst strength of UVGI exposed and unexposed respirator layers were done in a similar fashion. Differences in the breaking strength between UVGI exposed and nonexposed respirator straps were evaluated using a PROC MIXED procedure. Two tables showing the numerical results for all of the tests are included as on-line supplemental materials.\nRESULTS\nThe effects of different doses of UVGI on the ability of aerosol particles to penetrate through the different respirators are shown in Figure 1. For the control coupons, the penetration stayed the same or decreased slightly during the second test; the difference was statistically significant for only one respirator (Table I). For 16 of the 20 exposed coupons, the penetration increased after exposure, and the difference was statistically significant for 12 coupons. The mean penetration values for all of the coupons were 5% or less both before and after exposure.\nThe mean flow resistance of the control coupons increased from the first to the second test in two cases and decreased in two cases (Figure 2). The difference was statistically significant in one case (Table I) but for all controls the change was less than 1% of the initial value. The flow resistance increased after UVGI exposure for 12 of the exposed coupons and decreased for 8; the difference was statistically significant for 12 coupons, but the change was less than 6% of the initial value in all cases.\nThe strength of the different layers of respirator material generally decreased after UVGI exposure (Figure 3). At a dose of 120 J/cm2, only two of the 13 layers total lost a significant amount of strength; this increased to 10 of 13 layers at the maximum dose of 950 J/cm2 (Table II). In several cases, the strength fell more than 90% at the highest two doses.\nThe breaking strength of the respirator straps also decreased after UVGI exposure, but the effect was less pronounced than for the layers of respirator material (Figure 4). At a dose of 590 J/cm2, the mean strap breaking strengths decreased 10-21% compared to the paired controls, while the decrease was 14-28% for 1180 J/cm2 and 20-51% for 2360 J/cm2. In most cases, the decrease in breaking strength was statistically significant (Table III). \nDISCUSSION\nUltraviolet germicidal irradiation could potentially be used to disinfect disposable respirators, which could allow the respirators to be used safely multiple times during a public health emergency. However, before such a system can be implemented, it is important to understand how UVGI affects the respirator material, and especially whether UVGI degrades the protection offered by the respirator.\nPrevious studies of the effects of a single cycle or three cycles of lower doses of UVGI on respirators found that the penetration and resistance were not significantly changed.() The much higher doses of UVGI used in our experiments led to an increase in particle penetration of up to 1.25% in our respirator coupons, although all of the respirators had mean penetration values below 5% even after the maximum exposure levels. No obvious dose-response relationship occurred between the UVGI dose and the change in penetration, probably due in large part to variability in the coupons and the penetration test itself. These results suggest that UVGI could be used for respirator disinfection, but would need to be implemented cautiously, especially for respirators with a smaller safety margin between the actual penetration value and the 5% maximum allowed for an N95 respirator. It also suggests that each individual model of respirator to be disinfected should be tested, and that more testing is needed to determine if the particle penetration through UVGI-exposed respirators can increase to unacceptable values in some cases. The flow resistance was essentially unchanged after UVGI exposure for all of respirators tested, and it seems unlikely that the flow resistance will be a matter of concern with a UVGI system.\nIn contrast to the penetration and resistance, the strength of the respirator materials was dramatically affected by UVGI exposure in most cases. At the highest doses, many of the layers had lost most or all of their strength, and in several cases the material was visibly degraded with obvious breaks or tears and came apart easily. This suggests that the upper limit for UVGI exposure during repeated disinfection cycles would be set by the physical degradation of the respirator material and not by a loss in filtration capacity. For some respirator models, this could potentially serve as a useful warning; if the respirator material is degraded noticeably after UVGI disinfection, the respirator should be discarded. The respirator straps retained most of their strength even at the highest doses, which suggests again that the degradation of the body of the respirator will be the limiting factor in the use of UVGI and not the degradation of the straps. We believe that the most likely reason that the filtration capacity and the flow resistance do not change substantially even though the strength decreases is that the amount of physical load placed on the respirator material during filtration testing (and in normal use) is much lower than the maximum strength of the material. Consequently, the respirator material has a tremendous reserve capacity of physical strength. Although UVGI reduces the strength and toughness of polymers like polypropylene, the fibers will not actually break unless they are stressed.() Thus, we think the filter layer remains intact and is able to maintain its filtration capacity.\nThe number of UVGI cycles to which a disposable respirator could be subjected is a function of the resistance of the respirator to degradation and the UVGI dose used for each cycle. The UVGI dose, in turn, is controlled by the amount of UVGI required to inactivate any pathogens on the respirator. Two studies of UVGI disinfection of respirators exposed to droplets and aerosols containing influenza virus found that a 1.8 J/cm2 dose was sufficient to reduce the amount of viable influenza virus by a factor of &gt;104 (&gt;4-log reduction).() This suggests that, for influenza virus, dozens of UVGI disinfection cycles could be performed on respirators without the UVGI affecting their performance. Other pathogens require higher UVGI doses for disinfection (broadly speaking, to achieve a given reduction in viability, bacteria require higher doses than viruses and spores require much higher doses than vegetative cells).() For example, the UVGI dose required to disable 90% of a pathogen in aqueous suspension has been reported to be about 2.3 mJ/cm2 for influenza A virus, 4.8 mJ/cm2 for Mycobacterium tuberculosis (which causes tuberculosis), and 41.1 mJ/cm2 for Bacillus anthracis spores (which cause anthrax).() Thus, the utility of a UVGI system for disinfecting respirators may depend in part upon the pathogen involved.\nAnother important aspect to the UVGI disinfection and reuse of disposable respirators is the attenuation of the light by the FFR material, since this reduces the irradiation of pathogens trapped in the interior layers of the respirator. This is not a concern if disinfection of the exterior layers of the respirator is sufficient, but needs to be considered if complete disinfection is required. Fisher and Shaffer examined this question and estimated that, to expose the innermost part of a respirator to a given dose of UVGI, the exterior dose needed to be from 3.2-400 times the required interior level, depending upon the model of the respirator.() This suggests that some respirator models may work better with a UVGI system than others. The accumulation of contaminants on the respirator also can reduce the penetration of UVGI into the interior and increase the dose needed for disinfection.()\nBreaking strength vs. UVGI dose for respirator straps. Each data point shows the mean breaking strength for the respirator straps exposed to the dose of UVGI. Eight straps were tested at 4 different doses, with a matched control tested for each exposed strap (32 controls total). Error bars show the standard deviation.\nStrap Breaking Strength After UVGI Exposure\n 	 	Breaking strength	 	 	UVGI Dose	 	 	Respirator	(J/cm2)	Change (%)	p-value	 	3M 1860	590	-12%	0.2244	 	 	1180	-14%	0.011	 	 	2360	-23%	0.0053	 	3M 9210	590	-10%	0.0004	 	 	1180	-20%	&lt;.0001	 	 	2360	-20%	0.0004	 	Gerson 1730	590	-21%	0.0023	 	 	1180	-25%	&lt;.0001	 	 	2360	-51%	&lt;.0001	 	Kimberly-Clark	590	-13%	0.0012	 	 46727	1180	-28%	0.0082	 	 	2360	-26%	0.2648	 	\nA working group formed by the US Department of Veterans Affairs recently proposed desirable characteristics for a disposable N95 respirator designed specifically for healthcare workers.() One of their recommendations was that such a respirator be capable of being disinfected 50 times with each disinfection cycle taking less than 60 sec. Our results suggest that, with the appropriate design and choice of materials, a respirator and UVGI system could be designed to meet this goal. It would be relatively easy to design a small UVGI system that could meet the 60-sec cycle goal, while this would be extremely difficult for a chemical immersion, vapor, or steam-based system. In addition, because UVGI does not involve hazardous chemicals and can be reasonably compact and inexpensive, such systems could be deployed virtually anywhere within a healthcare facility for quick and easy disinfection of respirators by workers after tending to a patient.  \nFinally, the limitations of our study need to be acknowledged. First, we anticipate that the effects of UVGI on other respirators would be similar to those seen on the four models we tested, but if a UVGI system were to be implemented, the actual model of respirator used would need to be tested to determine the effects of UVGI upon it. Second, we tested coupons of material in a standard filter tester, which uses a unidirectional air flow and a dry salt aerosol. We expect that the results would be similar for intact respirators worn by people who are exhaling humid air and inhaling air containing a variety of types of particles, but this should be verified.\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe capacity to disinfect and reuse disposable N95 respirators may be needed during a pandemic of an infectious disease that spreads by airborne particles. Ultraviolet germicidal irradiation is one possible method for accomplishing this. In our experiments, UVGI had a small effect on filtration performance and essentially no effect on flow resistance at doses up to 950 J/cm2, while the structural integrity of the respirators showed a noticeable decrease at lower doses. The strength of the respirator straps was less affected by UVGI than the strength of the body material. Our results suggest that UVGI could be used to disinfect respirators, although the maximum number of disinfection cycles will be limited by the respirator model and the UVGI dose required to inactivate the pathogen.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThe authors thank David H.

One possible strategy to mitigate a respirator shortage is to reuse FFRs following a biological decontamination process to render infectious material on the FFR inactive. However, little data exist on the effects of decontamination methods on respirator integrity and performance. This study evaluated five decontamination methods [ultraviolet germicidal irradiation (UVGI), ethylene oxide, vaporized hydrogen peroxide (VHP), microwave oven irradiation, and bleach] using nine models of NIOSH-certified respirators (three models each of N95 FFRs, surgical N95 respirators, and P100 FFRs) to determine which methods should be considered for future research studies. Following treatment by each decontamination method, the FFRs were evaluated for changes in physical appearance, odor, and laboratory performance (filter aerosol penetration and filter airflow resistance). Additional experiments (dry heat laboratory oven exposures, off-gassing, and FFR hydrophobicity) were subsequently conducted to better understand material properties and possible health risks to the respirator user following decontamination. However, this study did not assess the efficiency of the decontamination methods to inactivate viable microorganisms. Microwave oven irradiation melted samples from two FFR models. The remainder of the FFR samples that had been decontaminated had expected levels of filter aerosol penetration and filter airflow resistance. The scent of bleach remained noticeable following overnight drying and low levels of chlorine gas were found to off-gas from bleach-decontaminated FFRs when rehydrated with deionized water. UVGI, ethylene oxide (EtO), and VHP were found to be the most promising decontamination methods; however, concerns remain about the throughput capabilities for EtO and VHP. Further research is needed before any specific decontamination methods can be recommended.\nINTRODUCTION\nDuring an influenza pandemic, a shortage of filtering facepiece respirators (FFRs) may occur if manufacturing production is unable to meet the demand or if FFR stockpiles become depleted. According to a 2006 report from the National Academies' Institute of Medicine, over 90 million N95 FFRs will be needed to protect workers in the healthcare sector during a 42-day influenza pandemic outbreak. Guidance provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) states that once an FFR is worn in the presence of an infected patient, it should be considered potentially contaminated and not be reused by the same person or a coworker. A contaminated FFR could potentially serve as a fomite and lead to self-inoculation or spread of the organism to patients and other healthcare workers. Guidance from the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) considers FFRs to be one-time-use devices when used in the presence of infected patients and advises employers and employees to only reuse FFRs during a pandemic if FFRs are in short supply and the device has not been obviously soiled or damaged (e.g. creased or torn), and it retains its ability to function properly.\nOne possible strategy to reduce the impact of a respirator shortage would be to apply a biological decontamination process (e.g. such as those used in hospital settings for infection control) to inactivate the influenza virus that may be on the FFR. If the treatment did not deteriorate the FFR or leave potentially toxic residues on the FFR, then it could be available for subsequent reuse by the original user. Until recently, no data were published on the effects of decontamination on FFR performance. measured the laboratory filtration performance of one N95 model and one P100 model FFR that were exposed to 20 different biological decontamination treatments. They found that filtration performance after one-time decontamination treatments using bleach, ethylene oxide (EtO), microwave oven irradiation, ultraviolet germicidal irradiation (UVGI), and hydrogen peroxide (vaporized and liquid forms) was observed to have filter aerosol penetration values that remained less than the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) certification criteria. It was also found that decontamination using an autoclave, 160 C dry heat, 70% isopropyl alcohol, and soap and water (20-min soak) caused significant degradation to filtration efficiency.\nExpanding on that research, the goal of this study was to further evaluate five of the decontamination methods examined in the previous study using a more diverse set of nine models of NIOSH-certified FFRs to determine which decontamination methods should be considered for future research studies. The biological decontamination methods used in this study include: (i) UVGI, (ii) EtO, (iii) vaporized hydrogen peroxide (VHP), (iv) microwave oven irradiation, and (v) 0.6% aqueous solution of sodium hypochlorite (hereafter referred to as 'bleach'). Following treatment by each decontamination method, FFRs were evaluated for changes in physical appearance/odor (observational analysis) and laboratory performance (filter aerosol penetration and filter airflow resistance). Additional experiments were then conducted to examine the material properties of the FFRs in an attempt to rationalize some of the findings in the laboratory performance evaluation and observational analysis. The advantages and disadvantages of the various decontamination methods (including throughput capacity and possible health risk to the user) were also assessed.\nMETHODS\nRespirator selection\nNine respirator models were used in this study, of which six models [three N95 FFR models (N95-A, N95-B, and N95-C) and three surgical N95 respirator models (SN95-D, SN95-E, and SN95-F)] constitute a random sampling from those N95 FFR models present in the US Strategic National Stockpile (SNS). Healthcare workers often use surgical N95 respirators, which are NIOSH-approved N95 FFRs that also have been cleared by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for marketing as medical devices. Surgical N95 respirators are designed to be fluid resistant to splash and spatter of blood and other infectious materials and thus may respond differently to the decontamination processes than N95 FFRs. Three models of P100 FFRs (P100-G, P100-H, and P100-I) were randomly selected from models commercially available at the time of the study and included because they were considered likely to be more resistant to filtration efficiency degradation and thus offer a more rigorous basis of comparison. All respirators were purchased and verified to be from the same respective manufacturing lot at the beginning of the study to minimize any lot-to-lot variation as well as to ensure consistency during FFR filtration performance testing. FFRs used in this study consisted of electrostatically charged polypropylene filters (electret filter media).\nDecontamination methods\nThe experimental conditions and parameters for the five decontamination methods and the 'as-received' (control) method are summarized in Table 1. All laboratory experiments were conducted under standard laboratory conditions (21 +- 2 C and relative humidity of 50 +- 10%) on triplicate sets of FFRs.\nFFR treatments\nTreatment	Experimental conditions and parameters	 	As-received	No decontamination treatment was performed (control group).	 	UVGI	FFRs placed on the working surface of a Sterilgard III laminar flow cabinet (The Baker Company, Sanford, ME, USA) fitted with a 40-W UV-C light (average UV intensity experimentally measured to range from 0.18 to 0.20 mW cm-2). Fifteen-minute exposure to each side (outer and inner), 176-181 mJ cm-2 exposure to each side of FFR.	 	EtO	Steri-Vac 5XL sterilizer (3M, St Paul, MN, USA). Single warm cycle (55 C and 725 mg l-1 100% EtO gas). FFRs and a chemical indicator placed in an individual standard poly/paper pouch. EtO exposure for 1 h followed by 4 h of aeration. FFRs were shipped to and from a commercial facility specializing in low-temperature sterilization methods and were tested within 72 h of receipt.	 	VHP	STERRAD  100S H2O2 Gas Plasma Sterilizer (Advanced Sterilization Products, Irvine, CA, USA), single 55-min standard cycle. FFRs and a chemical indicator placed in an individual Mylar/Tyvek  self-seal pouch. FFRs were shipped to and from a commercial facility specializing in low-temperature sterilization methods and were tested within 72 h of receipt.	 	Microwave oven irradiation	Commercially available 2450 MHz, Sharp Model R-305KS (Sharp Electronics, Mahwah, NJ, USA) microwave oven with revolving glass carousel, 1100 W (manufacturer rated); 750 W ft-3 experimentally measured; 2-min total exposure (1 min each side of FFR). A paper towel was placed on the revolving glass plate for insulation to protect the FFRs from melting onto the glass plate. Using a power setting of 10 (maximum power), FFRs were placed faceseal-side down, initially, to reduce the risk of faceseal component materials melting onto the paper towel due to elevated temperatures reached by the glass plate when microwaved for 2 min. Ambient cooling of the glass plate was maintained between trials.	 	Bleach	Thirty minutes submersion in 0.6% (one part bleach to nine parts of deionized water) aqueous solution of sodium hypochlorite (original concentration = 6% available as Cl2). Manufacturing specification: 6.00 +- 0.06% (w/w) available chlorine; Cat no. 7495.7-1, CAS no. 7732-18-5 (Ricca Chemical Company, Pequannock, NJ, USA). After treatment, FFRs were hung on a laboratory pegboard and allowed to air-dry overnight with assistance from a freestanding fan.	 	\nRespirator test methods\nObservational analysis.\nAll post-decontamination and control FFR samples were inspected and scrutinized carefully for any visible sign of degradation or changes that could be noted in texture or 'feel' of the respirator (softness, pliability, coarseness, roughness, etc.). All samples were sniffed for any discernible odor or smell.\nFilter aerosol penetration.\nA Model 8130 Automated Filter Tester (AFT) (TSI, Inc., St Paul, MN, USA) was used to measure initial filter aerosol penetration for all post-decontamination and control FFR samples. All tests were conducted at room temperature with a continuous airflow of 85 +- 4 l min-1 in accordance with NIOSH certification test procedures for challenging N-series filters, with two exceptions: all filters were tested for filter aerosol penetration without any relative humidity pretreatment or NaCl aerosol loading. Collecting the data in this manner allows consistency with previous work. Filter aerosol penetration levels were determined using a Plexiglas test box as previously used and described by or an appropriately sized test fixture supplied by the respective FFR manufacturer, as was the case for models N95-C, SN95-D, and P100-H.\nFilter airflow resistance.\nFor all control and post-decontamination FFR samples, a TSI Model 8130 AFT was also used to measure initial filter airflow resistance in millimeters of water column height pressure (mmH2O). It must be clarified that the NIOSH certification test for inhalation airflow resistance for FFRs is not performed using the TSI 8130 AFT but is executed in accordance with NIOSH Standard Test Procedure RCT-APR-STP-0007, which specifies the use of a different calibrated apparatus incorporating a vacuum source and manometer. For this evaluation, it was convenient to report the filter airflow resistance obtained from the TSI Model 8130 AFT because filter aerosol penetration and filter airflow resistance results are generated simultaneously and the intent is to determine changes in filter airflow resistance. This methodology was used previously by the National Personal Protective Technology Laboratory (NPPTL).\nExperimental design\nThe primary experimental design called for 162 FFRs (nine different FFR models x six test conditions x three samples per test condition) to be tested by observational analysis, for filter airflow resistance and for filter aerosol penetration. The 162 FFRs in the design included 135 post-decontamination FFRs and 27 control FFRs (no decontamination).\nStatistical analysis\nFor statistical analysis, the six test conditions (see Table 1) comprised one control group and five decontamination treatments. A one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) test was performed for each of the nine FFR models for filter aerosol penetration and filter airflow resistance (for 18 total tests). Thus, each model was treated independently due to its inherent uniqueness (difference in number of filter layers, hydrophobicity, materials of construction, etc.). Results were considered statistically significant if the P-value was &lt;0.05. Statistical analyses were performed using Microsoft Excel (Microsoft Corporation, part of Microsoft Office Professional Edition 2003). No statistical analysis of the subjective observational analysis data was done.\nAdditional testing\nAdditional secondary experiments were subsequently conducted on the FFRs to understand better their material properties. This information can be used to further optimize the decontamination methods and/or explain some of the findings from the observational analyses or laboratory performance evaluation experiments.\nDry oven experiments.\nTo investigate the effects on filter aerosol penetration at various dry heat temperatures and to determine if these effects were similar to those of FFRs that underwent microwave oven irradiation, new FFRs were placed in a Fisher Scientific Isotemp 500 Series laboratory oven (Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA, USA) for 1 h at temperatures ranging from 80 to 120 C. Filter aerosol penetration was measured after samples cooled to ambient temperature.\nHydrophobicity testing.\nA qualitative assessment of water affinity for each FFR filter media layer was performed to determine the hydrophobic/hydrophilic nature of the various layers for the nine different FFR models. For this experiment, it was hypothesized that the number of layers and the nature of the outer layer (surface of the FFR most distant from the wearer) and the inner layer (surface of the FFR closest to the breathing zone of the wearer) would provide insight into any model-specific effects associated with liquid chemical-based decontamination methods. A circular swatch (~5 cm in diameter) was cut from additional, new as-received samples of each FFR model. Following layer separations, a 100 mul aliquot of deionized water was pipetted onto the surface of each side of each layer (front and back). Two FFR models incorporated layers of plastic webbing, presumably to support shape; these layers were not tested because they are not filtering layers. A layer was noted as hydrophilic when it absorbed the water droplet. A layer was noted as hydrophobic when the water droplet beaded on the layer's surface.\nChlorine off-gassing experiments.\nTo quantify observations of discernable odor from FFRs following bleach decontamination, a series of off-gassing experiments was conducted using a Model 4340 Chlorine Gas Analyzer (Interscan Corp., Chatsworth, CA, USA). Chlorine off-gassing was measured from FFRs after bleach treatment as described in Table 1. A subset of four FFR models was chosen for testing based on the various combinations of water repellency discerned from the hydrophobicity experiments described previously: N95-A (outer hydrophobic layer/inner hydrophilic layer), N95-B (outer and inner hydrophilic layers), SN95-E (outer and inner hydrophobic layers), and SN95-F (outer hydrophobic layer/inner hydrophilic layer). Bleach off-gassing tests were conducted after a bleach decontamination treatment by immediately placing the FFR face up inside a plastic bag which was open to room air on one side. This setup was designed to minimize air fluctuation within the bag. The detector's sample tube inlet was positioned under the inside of the FFR and all tests were conducted at a flow rate of 0.5 l min-1. FFRs were tested under four conditions: (i) immediately after a 30-min submersion in bleach, (ii) dried overnight after a 30-min submersion in bleach, (iii) a 30-min submersion in bleach, immediately rinsed (under a flowing stream of deionized water for ~1 min) and then dried overnight, and (iv) a 30-min submersion in bleach, then dried overnight followed by rinsing with deionized water.\nRESULTS\nObservational analysis\nChanges to the FFR materials of construction caused by each decontamination treatment are summarized in Table 2. Respirator component materials melted on all six FFRs from two models (SN95-E and P100-I) during microwave oven irradiation. EtO and UVGI were the only methods that did not cause any observable physical changes to the FFRs.\nDiscernible observations caused by FFR decontamination treatments\nDecontamination treatment	Discernible observations	 	Bleach	Metallic nosebands were slightly tarnished and visibly not as shiny when compared with their as-received counterparts. SN95-E inner nose comfort cushion was discolored. Following air-drying overnight (16 h), all FFRs were dry to the touch and all still had a characteristic smell of bleach.	 	UVGI	No visible changes were observed for all samples.	 	EtO	No visible changes were observed for all samples.	 	VHP	Metallic nosebands were slightly tarnished and visibly not as shiny when compared with their as-received counterparts.	 	Microwave oven irradiation	All three physical samples of two different models (SN95-E and P100-I) melted partially. SN95-E filtration material melted in areas adjacent to the metallic nosebands. P100-I melted in various locations of the inner foam faceseal comfort lining. Both models were considered unwearable following treatment and subsequently were not evaluated for filter aerosol penetration or filter airflow resistance.	 	\nFilter aerosol penetration\nFor each 'FFR model/decontamination treatment' combination, the average initial filter aerosol penetrations are summarized in Table 3. Not all the 135 post-decontamination FFR samples in the experimental design were tested for filter aerosol penetration as planned; the six FFRs that exhibited melting after microwave irradiation could not undergo laboratory performance evaluation. The remaining 129 post-decontamination FFRs were tested and demonstrated expected levels of filtration efficiency performance. These results indicate that for all tested FFR samples that did not melt, FFR filtration performance was not adversely affected by the decontamination process. Most of the ANOVA tests for initial filter aerosol penetration were non-significant (P &gt; 0.05), (Table 4). In terms of average initial filter aerosol penetration, only P100-I yielded a significant difference by treatment (P = 0.0438), which appeared to be primarily driven by the increased filter aerosol penetration levels for the UVGI treatment (0.012 versus 0.008% for the control). Although statistically significant, this difference in levels of filter aerosol penetration is practically insignificant because the penetration levels still are far less than expected levels for this class of FFRs (&lt;0.03%).\nSummary data of filter aerosol penetration and filter airflow resistance for FFRs following various decontamination treatmentsa\nFFR model	Treatment	Average initial sodium chloride penetration (%P)	Standard deviation of penetration	Average initial resistance (mmH2O)	Standard deviation of resistance	 	N95 FFRs	 	N95-A	As-received	0.121	0.08	7.6	0.83	 	UVGI	0.072	0.04	7.6	0.29	 	EtO	0.101	0.06	7.3	0.10	 	VHP	0.071	0.04	7.8	0.21	 	Microwave	0.105	0.07	7.9	0.06	 	Bleach	0.262	0.18	8.1	0.47	 	N95-B	As-received	1.00	0.64	9.4	0.68	 	UVGI	0.76	0.43	10.3	0.12	 	EtO	0.667	0.39	9.7	0.10	 	VHP	0.659	0.34	9.6	0.50	 	Microwave	1.06	0.74	9.0	0.40	 	Bleach	0.629	0.34	9.8	0.30	 	N95-C	As-received	1.48	0.94	6.9	1.61	 	UVGI	1.77	0.96	7.1	1.68	 	EtO	1.82	1.12	6.9	1.47	 	VHP	1.47	0.91	6.5	2.37	 	Microwave	1.46	0.82	6.2	0.61	 	Bleach	1.13	0.79	8.0	3.06	 	Surgical N95 respirators	 	SN95-D	As-received	1.57	0.83	8.4	0.50	 	UVGI	1.86	0.97	9.2	0.44	 	EtO	0.90	0.49	8.1	0.32	 	VHP	0.71	0.50	8.6	1.04	 	Microwave	0.711	0.44	8.7	0.64	 	Bleach	0.561	0.38	9.6	0.29	 	SN95-E	As-received	0.335	0.19	6.1	0.15	 	UVGI	0.371	0.21	7.1	0.61	 	EtO	0.498	0.32	6.7	0.40	 	VHP	0.542	0.32	7.1	1.28	 	Microwave	Melted	Melted	Melted	Melted	 	Bleach	0.233	0.12	6.6	0.56	 	SN95-F	As-received	0.716	0.37	6.7	0.17	 	UVGI	0.720	0.37	6.6	0.26	 	EtO	0.687	0.35	6.3	0.25	 	VHP	0.727	0.37	6.5	0.29	 	Microwave	0.652	0.33	5.4	0.72	 	Bleach	0.692	0.35	5.9	0.46	 	P100 FFRs	 	P100-G	As-received	0.009	0.01	13.1	0.79	 	UVGI	0.005	0.00	13.1	1.21	 	EtO	0.003	0.00	12.8	0.57	 	VHP	0.006	0.01	13.4	1.23	 	Microwave	0.002	0.00	13.1	0.62	 	Bleach	0.006	0.00	13.6	0.92	 	P100-H	As-received	0.007	0.01	15.8	0.87	 	UVGI	0.007	0.01	16.0	1.82	 	EtO	0.003	0.00	15.2	0.64	 	VHP	0.010	0.01	15.0	1.27	 	Microwave	0.000	0.00	15.8	0.30	 	Bleach	0.010	0.01	15.1	0.81	 	P100-I	As-received	0.008	0.00	16.4	0.85	 	UVGI	0.012	0.01	16.5	0.10	 	EtO	0.006	0.00	15.9	0.76	 	VHP	0.007	0.00	16.2	0.93	 	Microwave	Melted	Melted	Melted	Melted	 	Bleach	0.004	0.00	17.0	0.98	 	\nFilter aerosol penetration and filter airflow resistance testing performed using a TSI 8130 AFT (n = 3).\nOne-way ANOVA test results for each FFR model\nFFR model	Penetration (P-value)	Resistance (P-value)	 	N95 FFRs			 	    N95-Aa	0.0635	0.1233	 	    N95-Ba	0.5761	0.0035b	 	    N95-Ca	0.8067	0.7572	 	Surgical N95 FFRs			 	    SN95-Da	0.7688	0.0170b	 	    SN95-Ec	0.2189	0.2448	 	    SN95-Fa	0.9409	0.0014b	 	P100 FFRs			 	    P100-Ga	0.2185	0.7446	 	    P100-Ha	0.3046	0.4970	 	    P100-Ic	0.0438a	0.2580	 	\nFor each FFR model with the exceptions of SN95-E and P100-I, one-way ANOVAs compare observed filter aerosol penetration or filter airflow resistance values for six test treatments [five different decontamination treatments and one as-received (control) group].\nValues in bold font are P-value &lt;0.05.

Respirator component materials melted for these FFRs during microwave oven irradiation and subsequently samples were not evaluated for initial filter aerosol penetration and initial filter airflow resistance.\nFilter airflow resistance\nFor each 'FFR model/decontamination treatment' combination, the average initial filter airflow resistances are summarized in Table 3. The six FFRs in which melting occurred could not be tested for filter airflow resistance. For the remaining 129 post-decontamination samples tested, average initial filter airflow resistance measurements were &lt;=17.0 mm H2O. Previous studies using the same test method on 21 models of NIOSH-approved N95 FFRs observed filter airflow resistance levels between 7 and 30 mmH2O. For filter airflow resistance, three of the nine ANOVA tests, including N95-B (P = 0.0035), SN95-D (P = 0.0170), and SN95-F (P = 0.0014), showed significantly different means (see Table 4). Although statistically significant, the levels of differences in filter airflow resistance between treatments are not practically meaningful as small changes in filter airflow resistance are unlikely to be noticed by the user.\nDry oven experiments\nThe degree to which temperature affects initial filter aerosol penetration and component melting was observed to be model specific (Figs 1 and 2). The average initial penetration (n = 3) for each N95 model is shown in Fig. 1. Only three tested N95 FFR samples had filter aerosol penetrations &gt;5% (therefore failed to maintain their expected filtration efficiency level of &gt;=95%). These three failing samples were one SN95-D (5.37% at 110 C) and two N95-C (5.18 and 5.37%, both at 120 C). Five of the SN95-D samples could not be analyzed following treatments of 100 C (one sample), 110 C (two samples), and 120 C (two samples) because their inner moisture barrier melted into the filtration media rendering those samples unsuitable for testing. For the three P100 FFR models, average initial filter aerosol penetration values for P100-G and P100-H exceeded 0.03% beginning at 100 C for P100-G and beginning at 90 C for P100-H (Fig. 2). P100-I averaged an initial filter aerosol penetration value &lt;0.03% for all evaluated temperature increments with the exception of one 110 C temperature experiment. This unexpectedly high average result was due to a single test (%P = 0.096).\nN95 FFR average initial sodium chloride filter aerosol penetration versus temperature. Each data point represents the average initial penetration of three samples (n = 3), unless otherwise noted. 'A' indicates five SN95-D FFRs melted, one at 100 C, two at 110 C, and two at 120 C and could not be penetration or airflow resistance tested.\nP100 FFR average initial sodium chloride filter aerosol penetration versus temperature. Each data point represents the average initial penetration of three samples (n = 3).\nHydrophobicity testing\nAll nine FFR models demonstrated differences in their number of media layers and the hydrophobicity of their filter media (Table 5). Common to all three models of surgical N95 respirator was the fact that their outer layer was hydrophobic. This is not surprising since surgical N95 respirators cleared by the US FDA undergo fluid resistance testing and are used as barriers against disease transmission by airborne respiratory fluids, including blood, and other small infectious droplets. The N95 FFRs and P100 FFRs varied by having either hydrophobic or hydrophilic outer and inner layers. All middle layers, with the exception of those that were plastic webbing, were hydrophobic on both sides.\nFFR media layer hydrophobicity\nFFR model	Total layers	Outer layer	Middle layers	Inner layer	 	N95 FFRs	 	N95-A	4	:	Second, :	+	 				Third, :		 	N95-B	2	+/:	No middle layer	:/+	 	N95-C	5	Plastic webbing	Second, :	:	 				Third, :		 				Fourth, plastic webbing		 	Surgical N95 respirators	 	SN95-D	5	:	Second, :	:	 				Third, :		 				Fourth, :		 	SN95-E	5	:	Second, :	:	 				Third, :		 				Fourth, :		 	SN95-F	4	:	Second, :	+	 				Third, :		 	P100 FFRs	 	P100-G	5	:	Second, :	+	 				Third, :		 				Fourth, :		 	P100-H	12	Plastic webbing	Second, :	:	 				Third, :		 				Fourth, :		 				Fifth, :		 				Sixth, plastic webbing		 				Seventh, :		 				Eighth, :		 				Ninth, :		 				10th, :		 				11th, plastic webbing		 	P100-I	6	+	Second, :	+	 				Third, :		 				Fourth, :		 				Fifth, :		 	\n:, both sides of layer are hydrophobic; +, both sides of layer are hydrophilic; +/:, outer side of layer is hydrophilic and inner side of layer is hydrophobic; :/+, outer side of layer is hydrophobic and inner side of layer is hydrophilic; plastic webbing, not tested.\nChlorine off-gassing experiments\nInitial concentrations of chlorine gas (2-12 p.p.m.) were measured on FFRs wet with bleach immediately following submersion for 30 min (Fig. 3). FFRs that were treated using bleach and allowed to air-dry overnight (as described in Table 1) had initial concentrations of ~0.05 p.p.m. followed by no detectable off-gassing (0 p.p.m.) after the initial data point. FFRs which were submerged in bleach, immediately rinsed (entirely under a stream of deionized water for ~1 min) and then allowed to air-dry overnight had concentrations similar to FFRs which were not rinsed, indicating that the water rinse had no effect. When FFRs were rehydrated by rinsing with deionized water following overnight air-drying, low-level chlorine off-gassing concentrations were measured at ~0.1 p.p.m. (Fig. 4).\nChlorine off-gassing of FFRs after 30 min submersion in bleach (tested wet).\nChlorine off-gassing of FFRs submerged in bleach (dried overnight then rinsed with deionized water and tested wet).\nDISCUSSION\nThe goal of this study was to evaluate five decontamination methods using nine FFR models from three FFR types (three N95 models, three surgical N95 respirator models, and three P100 models) to determine which methods should be considered for future research studies. The five decontamination methods were selected based on previous research from the NPPTL laboratory. Criteria for assessing methods of decontaminating disposable N95 FFRs have been suggested by the National Academies; the decontamination method must remove the viral threat, be harmless to the user, and not compromise the integrity of the various elements of the respirator. This manuscript utilizes and expands upon the second and third criteria. For purposes of discussion, a successful FFR decontamination method is considered to be a physical or chemical treatment which does not degrade laboratory performance (filter aerosol penetration and filter airflow resistance) beyond expected performance levels, is able to be performed on enough FFRs in a short period of time to be practical in the event of a pandemic-induced shortage, and should not pose any additional health risk to the user. In this study, assessment of potential health risks (e.g. possible dermal contact with residuals and/or inhalation of off-gassing residuals) was done using the observational analysis data, off-gassing test results, and general knowledge of the physical/chemical characteristics of the decontamination method. Chemical off-gassing is of particular concern because of the close proximity of the FFR to the wearer's face and breathing zone. A limited assessment of the throughput capability was also done using general knowledge of the various decontamination methods. Additional studies on dry heat laboratory oven exposure and FFR media layer hydrophobicity were conducted to collect data on various aspects of FFR resilience and construction in order to further optimize decontamination strategies and assess the practicality for FFR decontamination during a shortage. In the following sections, the results of laboratory performance testing and observational analysis, additional testing, and assessment of throughput and health concerns will be discussed for each of the five decontamination methods evaluated in order to provide recommendations on which decontamination methods should be considered in future research studies.\nBleach\nBleach is available as an aqueous solutions containing 5-15% sodium hypochlorite (active ingredient) which is a highly active oxidizing agent known to be effective against a broad spectrum of bacteria and viruses. Bleach decontamination did not affect the FFRs' filter aerosol penetration and filter airflow resistance. The metallic nosebands of all models that had them were slightly tarnished following decontamination and the inner nose cushion on the SN95-E FFRs was discolored. Throughput capability of a bleach method similar to the one used in this study is likely to be high; the main limiting factors are the size of the vessel containing the bleach and FFRs, adequate space to dry the FFRs, and sufficient time for air-drying.\nAll FFR models had a scent of bleach following overnight air-drying. Residual bleach remaining on FFRs is of concern given its known health effects. Hypochlorite powder, solutions, and vapor can be irritating and corrosive to the eyes, skin, and respiratory tract. For example, reported that a 5.25% sodium hypochlorite solution caused severe irritation to human skin over a 4-h exposure. Other studies also reported skin irritation for long-term exposure down to a 1% solution. Low concentrations of bleach have been shown to trigger respiratory events in asthmatics and sensitized individuals. The chlorine off-gassing measurements showed that overnight air-drying significantly reduced off-gassing; however, when the FFR was rehydrated with deionized water, an increase in off-gassing was measured. This observation may be significant when viewed in light of the moisture in the exhaled breath of an individual; it gives rise to the possibility of an individual being exposed to low levels of chlorine (&lt;0.2 p.p.m.) from a bleach-decontaminated FFR. Comparing Table 5 and data shown in Fig. 4, a relationship between hydrophobicity of outer and inner respirator surface layers to off-gassing concentration could not be established.\nConsidering the potential health risks, the bleach method evaluated in this study is not recommended for further study without modification. Possible modifications worth further investigation would include reduced initial bleach concentration, chemical methods for neutralizing residuals, additional rinse steps, and more aggressive air-drying procedures.\nEthylene oxide\nEtO is used in a wide range of work settings as a sterilant or fumigant, including healthcare, diagnosis, and treatment facilities; medical products manufacturing; and libraries and museums. EtO decontamination did not affect the filter aerosol penetration, filter airflow resistance, or physical appearance of the FFRs in this study. The EtO process used in this study has a 5-h total processing cycle (1-h EtO exposure followed by 4 h of aeration) and has a 4.8 ft3 (0.14 m3) chamber volume. The 5-h total processing time may be a limiting factor in the timely processing of a large volume of FFRs. Residual EtO remaining on FFRs following EtO vapor-phase decontamination is not believed to be a concern because the sterilization process includes a final aeration cycle of 4 h to remove residual EtO gas.\nVaporized hydrogen peroxide\nVHP has been shown to be sporicidal at temperatures ranging from 4 to 80 C, with sterilant concentrations ranging from 0.5 to &lt;10 mg l-1. VHP decontamination for a single warm cycle did not significantly affect FFR filter aerosol penetration or filter airflow resistance. The only visible physical effect on the FFRs was a slight tarnishing of the metallic nosebands. The VHP process used in this study has a short cycle time (55 min) and a usable processing volume of 3.5 ft3 (0.1 m3). Although the 55-min cycle time is short compared to the lengthy EtO total process time, the throughput capability of VHP processing is limited by the fact that cellulose-based products (e.g. cotton, which may be present in some head straps or some FFR layers) absorb hydrogen peroxide and can cause the STERRAD  cycle to abort due to low hydrogen peroxide vapor concentration. Significant levels of residual hydrogen peroxide vapors off-gassing from FFR materials following the STERRAD  process are unlikely and not of concern because the vapors decompose readily into water vapor and oxygen, both of which are environmentally benign.\nMicrowave oven irradiation\nBiological decontamination of FFRs using a domestic microwave oven is an attractive idea since it has the advantages of convenience and short treatment times. The decontamination method used here treats the microwave oven as a source of dry heat, similar to other studies. demonstrated that four avian viruses (infectious bronchitis virus, avian pneumovirus, Newcastle disease virus, and avian influenza virus) were inactivated on dried cotton swab samples using a domestic microwave oven for as little as 20 s. demonstrated destruction of Mycobacterium bovis dried onto scalpel blades after 4 min of microwave exposure.\nOf the nine FFR models that underwent microwave oven irradiation, filter aerosol penetration and filter airflow resistance were not affected for seven models. Material components melted on the two remaining models. Correlation could not be established for filter aerosol penetration results between dry oven-treated and microwave oven-irradiated samples. In microwave oven irradiation tests, all three SN95-D samples had penetration values &lt;5% and did not melt; however, some SN95-D samples partially melted at 100, 110, and 120 C during dry oven treatment (Fig. 1). All SN95-E samples and all P100-I samples partially melted in the microwave oven, but no melting was observed for these two models, even at 120 C following dry oven treatment (Table 3, Figs 1 and 2).\nThe throughput capability of a method similar to the one in this study was limited by microwaving one FFR at a time; however, the 2-min treatment time per FFR was relatively short. Although it is likely that processing more than one FFR at a time is feasible (limited only by the internal volume of the oven), maximizing throughput was beyond the scope of this investigation. No known health risks to the user were identified. The data presented here suggest that the dry microwave oven irradiation method requires improvement before it could be recommended for decontamination and subsequent reuse. Possible modifications worth further investigation would include microwave irradiation of wet FFRs, shorter exposure times, and lower power settings.\nUltraviolet germicidal irradiation\nUVGI has been demonstrated to be effective for the disinfection of drinking water and wastewater and for hospital air disinfection as a method for controlling airborne infectious disease. This study found that UVGI treatment did not affect the filter aerosol penetration, filter airflow resistance, or physical appearance of the FFRs. Throughput capability of a method similar to the one in this study is benefited by a relatively short irradiation time (30 min); however, it is limited by the available working surface area of a biosafety cabinet equipped with a UV-C source or other area being irradiated by a UVGI source. No known health risks to the user were identified.\nStudy limitations\nThese findings are exploratory and the data presented in this study are applicable only to the FFRs and decontamination methods tested; other FFRs may be more easily degraded while others may be less affected and slight modifications to the decontamination methods could result in different findings. Future studies are still needed to evaluate whether the decontamination processes evaluated in this study will inactivate infectious microorganisms (or appropriate surrogates), if FFR decontamination influences respirator fit, and the effect of multiple decontamination treatments on FFR performance. Future studies should also investigate the depths that infectious organisms (or appropriate surrogates) penetrate into each FFR layer, assess the relative cost of various decontamination strategies, and determine how effective various decontamination methods are at reducing the number of viable virus in all layers of the FFRs. Recent work in the NPPTL laboratory toward developing a system for studying the virucidal capability of decontamination methods for FFRs appears promising.\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe effects of the various decontamination methods on the laboratory performance (filter aerosol penetration and filter airflow resistance) and physical appearance of FFRs were found to be model specific. The respirators tested have differences in their design, materials of construction, and hydrophobicity of their layers (including the filter media layers). Microwave oven irradiation melted all six samples from two FFR models. The remainder of the FFR samples that were evaluated exhibited average initial filter airflow resistances &lt;=17.0 mmH2O and average initial sodium chloride filter aerosol penetration values &lt;=1.86% for N95 FFRs and &lt;=0.012% for P100 FFRs. Although there were statistically significant differences found between control respirators and those that have undergone decontamination for both filter aerosol penetration and filter airflow resistance, the practical significance is minimal as the range of numerical differences is quite small. The scent of bleach remained noticeable on all FFR models following overnight drying and low levels of chlorine were found to off-gas from bleach-decontaminated FFRs when rehydrated with deionized water, thus giving rise to the possibility of low-level exposure to a subsequent wearer.\nIn light of these results, the microwave oven irradiation and bleach decontamination methods investigated in this study were determined to be the least desirable among the five methods tested for consideration in future studies. UVGI, EtO, and VHP were found to be the most promising decontamination methods; however, concerns remain about the throughput capabilities for EtO and VHP. Further research is needed before any specific decontamination methods can be recommended.\nFUNDING\nNational Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (CAN #921Z6PT).\nReferences\nUltraviolet disinfection of water\nGuidelines for preventing the transmission of Mycobacterium tuberculosis in health-care facilities\nInactivation of Cryptosporidium parvum oocysts using medium- and low-pressure ultraviolet radiation\nMicrowave or autoclave treatments destroy the infectivity of infectious bronchitis virus and avian pneumovirus but allow detection by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction\nSodium hypochlorite dermatitis\nDevelopment of a test system to apply virus containing particles to air permeable materials for the evaluation of decontamination procedures for filtering facepiece respirators\nMethod for evaluating germicidal ultraviolet inactivation of biocontaminated surfaces\nSensitization to sodium hypochlorite causing contact dermatitis\nIrritation factors of sodium hypochlorite solutions in human skin\nGaseous chemical sterilization\nTechnical and sanitary aspects of wastewater disinfection by UV irradiation for landscape irrigation\nAdvanced wastewater disinfection technologies: state of the art and perspective\nEffect of ultraviolet germicidal lamps on airborne microorganisms in an outpatient waiting room\nAntiseptics and disinfectants: activity, action, and resistance\nAsthma, chronic bronchitis, and exposure to irritant agents in occupational domestic cleaning: a nested case-control study\nEvaluation of a methodology for quantifying the effect of room air ultraviolet germicidal irradiation on airborne bacteria\nOccupational risk factors for asthma among nurses and related healthcare professionals in an international study\nFans, filters, or rays?

play an important role in driving the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n To better understand how airborne SARS-CoV-2 transmission occurs, we sought to determine viral loads within coarse (&gt;5?m) and fine (?5?m) respiratory aerosols produced when breathing, talking, and singing.\n\n\nMethods\nUsing a G-II exhaled breath collector, we measured viral RNA in coarse and fine respiratory aerosols emitted by COVID-19 patients during 30 minutes of breathing, 15 minutes of talking, and 15 minutes of singing.\n\n\nResults\nThirteen participants (59%) emitted detectable levels of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in respiratory aerosols, including 3 asymptomatic and 1 presymptomatic patient.\n\n Viral loads ranged from 63–5,821 N gene copies per expiratory activity per participant, with high person-to-person variation.\n\n Patients earlier in illness were more likely to emit detectable RNA.\n\n Two participants, sampled on day 3 of illness, accounted for 52% of the total viral load.\n\n Overall, 94% of SARS-CoV-2 RNA copies were emitted by talking and singing.\n\n Interestingly, 7 participants emitted more virus from talking than singing.\n\n Overall, fine aerosols constituted 85% of the viral load detected in our

SARS-CoV-2 transmission.\n\n Exposure to fine aerosols, especially indoors, should be mitigated.\n\n Isolating viable SARS-CoV-2 from respiratory aerosol samples remains challenging, and whether this

Large Mobile Air Purifiers on Aerosol Concentration in Classrooms and the Reduction of Airborne Transmission of SARS-CoV-2","abstract":"In the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, an increased risk of infection by virus-containing aerosols indoors is assumed.\n Especially in schools, the duration of stay is long and the number of people in the rooms is large, increasing the risk of infection.\n This problem particularly affects schools without pre-installed ventilation systems that are equipped with filters and/or operate with fresh air.\n Here, the aerosol concentration is reduced by natural ventilation.\n In this context, we are investigating the effect of large mobile air purifiers (AP) with HEPA filters on particle concentration and their suitability for classroom use in a primary school in Germany.\n The three tested APs differ significantly in their air outlet characteristics.\n Measurements of the number of particles, the particle size distribution, and the CO2 concentration were carried out in the classroom with students (April/May 2021) and with an aerosol generator without students.\n In this regard, the use of APs leads to a substantial reduction of aerosol particles in the considered particle size range of 0.178–17.78 µm.\n At the same time, the three APs are found to have differences in their particle decay rate, noise level, and flow velocity.\n In addition to the measurements, the effect of various influencing parameters on the potential inhaled particle dose was investigated using a calculation model.\n The parameters considered include the duration of stay, particle concentration in exhaled air, respiratory flow rate, virus lifetime, ventilation interval, ventilation efficiency, AP volumetric flow, as well as room size.\n Based on the resulting effect diagrams, significant recommendations can be derived for reducing the risk of infection from virus-laden aerosols.\n Finally, the measurements were compared to computational fluid dynamics (CFD) modeling, as such tools can aid the optimal placement and configuration of APs and can be used to study the effect of the spread of aerosols from a source in the classroom.\n","id":"PMC8583054","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"MDPI","authors":[{"firstname":"Finn

physics-based approach","abstract":"id='P3'>Low-cost sensors for measuring particulate matter (PM) offer the ability to understand human exposure to air pollution at spatiotemporal scales that have previously been impractical.\n However, such low-cost PM sensors tend to be poorly characterized, and their measurements of mass concentration can be subject to considerable error.\n Recent studies have investigated how individual factors can contribute to this error, but these studies are largely based on empirical comparisons and generally do not examine the role of multiple factors simultaneously.\n Here, we present a new physics-based framework and open-source software package (opcsim) for evaluating the ability of low-cost optical particle sensors (optical particle counters and nephelometers) to accurately characterize the size distribution and/or mass loading of aerosol particles.\n This framework, which uses Mie theory to calculate the response of a given sensor to a given particle population, is used to estimate the fractional error in mass loading for different sensor types given variations in relative humidity, aerosol optical properties, and the underlying particle size distribution.\n Results indicate that such error, which can be substantial, is dependent on the sensor technology (nephelometer vs.\n optical particle counter), the specific parameters of the individual sensor, and differences between the aerosol used to calibrate the sensor and the aerosol being measured.\n We conclude with a summary of likely sources of error for different sensor types, environmental conditions, and particle classes and offer general recommendations for the choice of calibrant under different measurement

ventilation upgrades or commercial air purification systems, raising concerns on the safety of opening activities in these places in the era of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n To address this challenge, using computational fluid dynamics, we conducted a systematic investigation of airborne transmission in a classroom equipped with a single horizontal unit ventilator (HUV) and evaluate the performance of a low-cost box fan air cleaner for risk mitigation.\n Our study shows that placing box fan air cleaners in the classroom results in a substantial reduction of airborne transmission risk across the entire space.\n The air cleaner can achieve optimal performance when placed near the asymptomatic patient.\n However, without knowing the location of the patient, the performance of the cleaner is optimal near the HUV with the air flowing downwards.\n In addition, we find that it is more efficient in reducing aerosol concentration and spread in the classroom by adding air cleaners in comparison with raising the flow rate of HUV alone.\n The number and placement of air cleaners need to be adjusted to maintain their efficacy for larger classrooms and to account for the thermal gradient associated with a human thermal plume and hot ventilation air during cold seasons.\n Overall, our study shows that box fan air cleaners can serve as an effective low-cost alternative for mitigating

transmitted within indoor spaces.\n\n Therefore, environmental characterization of SARS-CoV-2 viral load with respect to human activity, building parameters, and environmental mitigation strategies is critical to combat disease transmission.\n\n\nMethods\nWe recruited 11 participants diagnosed with COVID-19 to individually occupy a controlled chamber and conduct specified physical activities under a range of environmental conditions; we collected human and environmental samples over a period of three days for each participant.\n\n\nResults\nHere we show that increased viral load, measured by lower RNA cycle threshold (CT) values, in nasal samples is associated with higher viral loads in environmental aerosols and on surfaces captured in both the near field (1.2 m) and far field (3.5 m).\n\n We also found that aerosol viral load in far field is correlated with the number of particles within the range of 1 µm -2.5 µm.\n\n Furthermore, we found that increased ventilation and filtration significantly reduced aerosol and surface viral loads, while higher relative humidity resulted in lower aerosol and higher surface viral load, consistent with an increased rate of particle deposition at higher relative humidity.\n\n Data from near field aerosol trials with high expiratory activities suggest that respiratory particles of smaller sizes (0.3 µm -1 µm) best characterize the variance of near field aerosol viral load.\n\n\nConclusions\nOur findings indicate that building operation practices such as ventilation, filtration, and humidification substantially reduce the

The tested steam bags were found to be 99.9% effective for inactivating MS2 on FFRs; however, more research is required to determine the effectiveness against respiratory pathogens.\nIntroduction\nThe potential reuse of National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) -certified N95 filtering facepiece respirators (FFRs) has been suggested as a possible strategy to conserve available supplies for home and healthcare environments during an influenza pandemic. Reuse of FFRs may result in a risk of contact transmission by touching a contaminated surface of the respirator followed by touching the eyes, nose, and/or mouth. Physical and chemical methods to remove or inactivate viruses on FFR surfaces have been previously examined. These methods were evaluated for decontamination efficacy, effect on FFR filtration and fit, wearer safety (i.e. chemical residues and off-gassing) and processing cost as suggested in a report issued by the Institute of Medicine (IOM). The IOM report also recommended that simple decontamination methods should be evaluated for ease of implementation in home and healthcare settings.\nSome of the previously examined methods, although promising in laboratory studies, may not be universally suited for both healthcare and home environments. Methods that require decontamination equipment such as UV lights, vaporous hydrogen peroxide generators, and moist heat incubators would be better suited for healthcare facilities where such disinfection equipment is more likely to be available. Home environments lack sophisticated decontamination technology, but have disinfectants such as bleach and peroxide; however, the use of these products for FFR decontamination would require customized procedures which may not be easily executed by the general public. Moreover, skin and inhalation health hazards from the use of chemically treated FFRs are a concern. Healthcare professionals, including infection control practitioners, are better prepared to follow customized detailed disinfection procedures than the general public due to training and experience. The logistics of an FFR decontamination program also need to be considered. FFR decontamination in healthcare settings may occur as a batch process, whereby one or a few employees decontaminate all FFRs or as an individual process, whereby the individual user is responsible for decontaminating their own respirator. Each scenario requires a system to identify the FFR user (to avoid sharing of FFRs among users), to track the number of decontamination cycles for each FFR, and to provide a means to efficiently store the FFR between uses.\nOne possibility of overcoming the problems posed by the lack of decontamination equipment and elaborate protocols is to use technology that is readily available and already used by the general public for other applications with similar requirements. Off-the-shelf microwave steam bags (MSBs) are one option that may be used in healthcare and home environments. These bags, typically used to decontaminate breast pump and infant feeding accessories, are available for purchase in many retail stores where infant associated goods are sold. The instructions are written for the general public and are based on the operation of a microwave oven, which are readily available in home and healthcare environments. The use of commercially available steam bags for FFR decontamination has not been investigated, although previous studies suggest that microwave generated steam decontamination is promising. The goal of this study is to evaluate the use of two commercially available steam bags for FFR decontamination with specific considerations to FFR filtration performance, FFR water absorption, decontamination efficacy, ease of use, and logistic benefits.\nResults\n Table 1 lists the water absorption/retention and filtration efficiency of all FFR models after one cycle of steam bag decontamination using the MSB X bags. All of the six FFR models (one sample per model) surpassed the filtration efficiency requirements of 95%. The absorption values for models 3M 1860, 3M 8210 and the Cardinal Health N95 were roughly an order of magnitude higher than the values for 3M 1870, Kimberly-Clark PFR95, and Moldex 2200. The models 3M 1860, 3M 8210 and the Cardinal Health N95 remained wet after the 60 min drying period and were eliminated from further testing.\nPhase 1 screening of FFRs for water absorbency and filtration efficiency.\nFFR Details	Water Content (g) #	Filtration Efficiency (%)	 	Model	Type	Contains Hydrophilic layer(s)*	After decon.	60 min	As received	After 1X	 	3M 1870	Surgical	no	0.4	0.1	99.67	99.62	 	3M 1860	Surgical	yes	13.5	9.6	99.28	99.47	 	KC PFR95	Surgical	no	0.9	0	96.13	95.77	 	3M 8210	Particulate	yes	11.6	8.2	99.88	99.34	 	Cardinal Health	Particulate	yes	12.8	11.2	99.62	99.56	 	Moldex 2200	Particulate	no	1.5	0.2	98.52	99.24	 	\n*Data modified from references (10) and (14).\nDetermined using MSB X bags.\nn = 1.\nIn the second phase of testing, the triplicate samples for each of the FFR models, 3M 1870, Kimberly-Clark PFR95, and Moldex 2200, passed the filtration efficiency testing after three cycles of decontamination using both steam bag brands (Table 2). For the MSB X bags, the filtration efficiencies of the experimental models were statistically similar to the controls for both the 3M 1870 (p = 0.19) and the Moldex 2200 (p = 0.40), while the treated Kimberly-Clark PFR95 models were statistically different from the controls (p = 0.01). MSB Y bags produced statistically similar results for the control and treated samples for each model; 3M 1870 (p = 0.19) Moldex 2200 (p = 0.40) and Kimberly-Clark PFR95 (p = 0.42). The results for drying of the FFRs were similar for 30 min compared to the 60 min drying time (Tables 1 and 2). All models from the second phase of testing were included in the third phase of testing.\nPhase 2 testing for water absorbency and filtration efficiency.\nFFR	Water Content (g) #	Filtration Efficiency (%)	 	Type	Model	After (3X) decon.	30 min	As received	MSB X (3X)	MSB Y (3X)	 	Surgical	3M 1870	1.7+-1.4	0.1+-0.1	99.7+-0.1	98.6+-0.6	99.0+-1.1	 	Surgical	KC PFR95	1.3+-1.3	0+-0	96.1+-0.4	95.5+-0.3	96.4+-1.2	 	Particulate	Moldex 2200	0.9+-0.4	0.1+-0.1	98.5+-1.0	98.6+-0.8	98.4+-1.5	 	\nDetermined using MSB X bags.\nn = 3.\n Table 3 lists the CV values for the MS2 contamination of each FFR model.

The MS2 challenge concentration for the Moldex models was more than 2 logs higher than the Kimberly Clark (7.1) or 3M 1860 (7.6).

The steam bags, constructed for the purpose of disinfection (baby bottles and breast pumps), are readily available for purchase. The instructions for use are clearly provided on the side of the bags (Fig. 1). Simple, well-illustrated decontamination instructions are important for users with limited experience in disinfection and sterilization. For the MSB X bags, the instructions are included in an approximate 8&quot; x4&quot; panel and are accompanied by step-by-step photographs. MSB Y bags include use instruction in three languages, English, Spanish, and French. The instructions are written for a range of microwave powers (500-1100W+), providing versatility for multiple microwave models. The steam bag can provide a dual function of storage and decontamination. A used FFR can be stored in the bag and decontaminated when use is required. Defined areas on the bag for the user's name and a checkbox indicating the number of uses provides a method for inventory accounting.\nPhotographs of the front (left) and back (right) panels of the microwave steam bags.\nTop: MSB X bags. Bottom: MSB Y bags.\nSteam sterilization, by the use of autoclaves, is routinely used in the processing of medical equipment. Autoclaves produce high pressure saturated steam and are effective at inactivating microorganisms including spores. Unfortunately, autoclaving is highly destructive process for some FFR models. Atmospheric applications of steam, such as the use of MSBs, are less destructive on FFRs but are less effective in inactivating microorganisms. Furthermore, the disinfecting ability of steam bags is not well characterized. Labeling on the steam bags or the steam bag packaging claims that &quot;steam kills 99.9% of most harmful bacteria and germs&quot;. The steam bags repeatedly produced a 3 log or 99.9% reduction in MS2 for the three FFR models tested in this study (Table 3). FFR decontamination using microwave generated steam has been examined previously, although without the use of a steam bag. Fisher et al., 2009, demonstrated a greater than 4 log, or 99.99%, reduction of MS2 virus after a 45 s treatment. This study was performed on small FFR coupons contaminated with MS2-containing droplet nuclei in the same model microwave used in this current investigation. Fisher et al. (2010) examined cyclic MS2 contamination and decontamination of FFRs with microwave generated steam. The findings in that study suggest that protective residues (proteins, respiratory secretions, cellular debris, etc.), which are a component of infectious aerosols, have less of an effect on the decontamination efficacy of steam compared to other decontamination methods. Heimbuch et al. studied the use of microwave generated steam on the inactivation of H1N1 deposited on FFRs as aerosols and droplets. The microwave generated steam yielded a &gt;4-log reduction of viable H1N1 virus for all FFR tested. In 93% of the experiments, the virus was reduced to levels below the limit of detection of the method. The presence of some viable virus on the FFRs was speculated to be &quot;due to non-uniform distribution of steam over the entire surface of the FFR&quot;. Heimbuch et al. further speculated that &quot;optimization of the water reservoir holder will likely minimize or eliminate this issue&quot;. The steam bags, used in this study, provide a defined volume for the entrapment of steam and, therefore, a more uniform application.\nThe FFR filtration performance for the three cycle treatments was within acceptable levels of the selection criterion for each FFR model treated in each steam bag brand. Bergman et al. reported similar results with no deleterious effect of microwave generated steam on the filtration performance of three surgical and three particulate N95 FFRs. Moreover Bergman et al. and Viscusi et al. found fit of the FFR models used in their investigations to be unaffected by the use of microwave generated steam. Although the steam bags used in this study differs from the vessel used to house the FFRs in the Viscusi and Bergman studies, the results are promising.\nThe use of a steam bag has some limitations for FFR decontamination. The steam bags do not compartmentalize the water reservoir and sample location. The FFR is placed directly into the water in the reservoir, which produces the potential for water absorption by the FFR material. Water absorbency is important as a saturated FFR would require an extended drying period before reuse is possible. An extended drying period is counterproductive to increasing FFR supply in the event of shortages due to high demand. The potential to use the steam bags for FFR decontamination will likely be FFR model specific, as demonstrated by the water absorption data in this study (Tables 1 and 2). The absorption characteristics were also independent of the FFR classification as a particulate or surgical mask, which suggests simplification of determining decontamination potential is unlikely. These findings are supported by the results discussed in Viscusi et al. 2009, where differences in the hydrophobicity of FFR models, individual layers of FFRs, and even differences between the surfaces of a given layer were confirmed. In fact, the FFR models eliminated after the first phase of testing were found to contain at least one hydrophilic layer, whereas the models proceeding to the second phase of testing were constructed entirely of hydrophobic materials.\nThe decontamination procedure and demonstrated efficacy of the MSBs are not in alignment with current FDA guidelines and requirements for the reuse of single use medical devices. However, government recommendations for FFR reuse are complicated; CDC and NIOSH recommendations have permitted reuse (i.e., multiple donnings of a previous worn FFR) without decontamination in some unique situations such treating TB patients and in emergency situations when supplies are limited (e.g., during the 2009-10 novel H1N1 influenza pandemic). Furthermore, many FFR models used in healthcare (including 3 in this study) and nearly half of those models in the U.S. Strategic National Stockpile are not currently regulated by FDA as they are not being marketed as medical devices. Currently, NIOSH respirator certification does not include provisions for FFR decontamination and reuse. Decontamination of NIOSH certified FFRs for purposes of reuse is not recommended in the workplace, primarily because of concerns that decontamination would degrade the performance of the respirator. Thus, the results of this study should be viewed from the context of informing future government, public health, and infection control recommendations in an emergency, rather than as recommending changes to routine practice.\nA cleaning procedure was not included as part of this study; however, it was previously demonstrated that soil load accumulation may not significantly impact microwave generated steam decontamination of FFRs. Likewise, a high level disinfection, which eliminates all microorganisms except for a small number of bacterial spores, was not achieved with the use of the steam bags. Initial virus titers between 107 and 1010 pfu/FFR were reduced by 99.9%; leaving roughly 104 to 106 pfu/FFR. The titer of viable MS2 remaining on the respirator can present major health hazard concerns. However, the number of viable MS2 applied to the respirators (7-10 log10 pfu) greatly exceeds the expected contamination levels of in-use scenarios.\nIn healthcare and home environments alike, the performance of the steam, and microwave ovens, may demonstrate some variability. It should be noted that the microwave used in this study was rated at 1100 W by the manufacturer, but was experimentally determined to function at 750 W previously. It is possible that applying a longer treatment time, indicated by the steam bag instructions for a 750 W microwave, would produce increased decontamination efficacy. However, this introduces another level of complexity as it is possible that microwave performance in homes and healthcare settings may not be consistent with manufacturer ratings. It is possible that some of the steam bags may demonstrate inconsistent behavior. In this limited investigation, the steam bags were monitored for failures in the seams and zip lock seals after decontaminations with no discernable failures. The consistent decontamination performance of the steam bags supports the observation of maintained structural integrity during the steam procedure. However, care must be taken not to generalize this finding beyond the scope of this study.\nMore studies are required before the use of steam bags can be considered for FFR decontamination for the purpose of reuse. In general, reuse requires a higher degree of rigor than single use applications. Commonly used in the evaluation of medical devices, an ultrastructural analysis of the decontaminated FFRs may help to address concerns and knowledge gaps associated with FFR reuse. Quality control assessments of the steam bags and microwave ovens should be performed to investigate the utility of the steam bag decontamination procedure. Likewise, implementing MSB decontamination of FFRs in home and healthcare settings would present quality control issues which should be investigated for each environment. The use of MS2, a nonenveloped virus, in this study does not accurately reflect the potential efficacy of the steam bag against enveloped viruses including 2009 H1N1. In general, enveloped viruses are more susceptible to decontamination due to the fragile lipid coat. Testing the steam bags against other microbes can assist discerning the steam bags' potential. FFRs decontaminated using the steam bags should be fit tested to ascertain if any changes to FFR shape and fit occurred as a result of the steam process, although previous research with microwave generated steam suggests that this is unlikely.\nMaterials and Methods\nExperimental procedure\nThe evaluation of the feasibility of steam bag decontamination of FFRs was studied in three phases. In the first phase, a preliminary screening of the six models of respirators treated in one brand of MSB was conducted using two quality objectives: limited filtration performance degradation and low water absorbency/retention. Each quality objective was evaluated using a predetermined standard. Firstly, the steam bag decontamination must not degrade the filtration performance of the FFR below the efficiency required (95% efficient) by NIOSH certification requirements outlined in 42 CFR 84. Secondly, the FFR must be dry (defined for this study as less than 1 g water content) within 60 min of drying time under room conditions (approx. 20 C and 60% RH). The rationale for this requirement is the users would be unlikely to find wearing a wet respirator to be uncomfortable, previously identified as a barrier to respirator tolerability. The filtration efficiency and water absorbency/retention determination was performed for one sample of each FFR model for phase 1.\nIn phase 2 testing, FFR models passing the preliminary assessment were evaluated for filtration efficiency following three cycles of steam bag sterilization which included a 30 min drying period between treatments. Each model was evaluated in triplicate for each MSB brand. The FFRs were evaluated for water absorption/retention after 30 min of drying time following steam treatment using one MSB brand. FFR models exceeding the predefined quality standards were eliminated from phase 3 testing.\nIn the final phase of testing, the decontamination efficacy of the steam bag was determined in triplicate for the FFR models passing the phase 2 evaluation using both brands of bags. For each FFR model, six samples were contaminated with MS2 droplets. The MS2 from three of the samples for each FFR model was collected and enumerated to determine the loading level. The other three samples were decontaminated using one brand of MSBs. The process for each FFR was repeated for the second brand of MSBs. Upon decontamination the MS2 was collected from the filter samples and enumerated via plaque assay.\nRespirator selection\nSix respirator models were used in this study. Three of the models, namely the 3M 1870 (3M, St. Paul MN), 3M 1860 (3M, St. Paul MN), and the Kimberly-Clark PFR95 (Kimberly-Clark, Dallas, TX) are surgical N95 FFRs. Surgical N95 FFRs are NIOSH-approved particulate respirators that have also been cleared by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as medical devices. Three particulate FFR models included in the study are the 3M 8210 (3M, St. Paul MN), Moldex 2200 (Moldex, Culver City, CA) and Cardinal Health (Cardinal Health, Dublin, OH). All models used were available in the Strategic National Stockpile at the time of writing except for the Cardinal Health FFR, which was randomly selected from the laboratory stock.\nSteam bag design and use instructions\n Figure 1 shows the front and back panels of the two brands of MSBs used for this study, namely, the Medela Quick CleanTM MICRO-STEAMTM BAGS (Medela, McHenry, IL) and the Munchkin  Steam Guard  Bags (Munchkin Inc., North Hills, CA). These bags will be denoted as &quot;MSB X&quot; or &quot;MSB Y&quot; for the former and later, respectively. Both steam bag brands have similar design structures which include a zipper lock seal, a steam exhaust port, internal pleat, and a volume of approximately 2.2 L (Fig. 2).\nIllustration of the components of the microwave steam bags and the placement of a typical FFR into the water reservoir.\nThe manufacturer's instructions for use with baby feeding accessories were applied to the steam treatment of FFRs. The instructions were the same for each steam bag brand. Individual FFRs were placed inside separate bags filled with 60 ml of tap water (Fig. 2). The bags were sealed, using the bag's integrated zipper lock seal and placed in a commercially available Sharp Model R-305KS (2450 MHz, 1100 W) microwave oven (Sharp Electronics, Mahwah, NJ, USA). The FFRs in the sealed steam bags were irradiated on high power for 90 s; the prescribed time for a microwave with a rating of 1100 W.\nFiltration performance\nA Model 8130 Automated Filter Tester (AFT) (TSI, Inc., St. Paul, MN, USA) was used to measure initial percent filter aerosol penetration and filter airflow resistance for FFR models as received (control), 1 cycle treated FFRs, and 3 cycle treated FFRs. The TSI 8130 AFT delivers a solid polydispersed sodium chloride (NaCl) aerosol that meets the particle size distribution criteria set forth in 42 CFR 84 Subpart K, Section 84.181 for NIOSH certification (CFR, 1995). Filter penetration testing was performed using a similar but abbreviated version of the NIOSH certification protocol previously used to evaluate FFR filtration performance.\nWater absorbency determination\nFFRs were decontaminated using the MSB X bags as described above. The FFRs were weighed prior to decontamination to determine the dry weight and reweighed immediately following decontamination and after a predetermined drying period of 30 or 60 min to determine the wet weight. The dry weight was subtracted from the wet weight to determine the amount of water absorbed or retained by the material of the FFR. MSB Y bags were not used to assess FFR water absorbency; however, comparable water absorbency values for FFRs treated in the in both brands of bags are expected due to the similar steam bag designs, which have the FFR partially submerged in the water (Fig. 2).\nMedia, virus, and host cells\nThe media, virus, and host cells used in this research have been described previously. Briefly, American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) medium 271 (http://www.atcc.org/Attachments/3600.pdf) was used to grow Escherichia coli (ATCC 15597) and prepare, store, recover, aerosolize and assay of MS2 (ATCC 1597-B1). The droplet-generating medium consisted of 100% ATCC medium 271. ATCC medium 271 amended with 5 g/L agar (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) was used to enumerate MS2 using a single agar plaque assays similar to methods previously described.\nFFR virus droplet loading\nVirus containing droplets were applied to FFRs using a spray bottle (Fisherbrand Adjustable-Spray Mini-Wash Bottle, Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA). FFRs were mounted (friction fitted) to a funnel, which served as the FFR holder, and attached to a ring stand (Fig. 3). Models that were unable to fit the funnel were placed on a head form. The spray bottle, containing 100 ml of MS2 suspension (109 plaque forming units/ml), was placed 12&quot; from the closest plane of the FFR. Five sprays of virus containing droplets were applied to FFR. The contaminated FFRs were allowed to dry for 30 min. before decontamination. The funnel served as the preferred respirator holder since the entire FFR/funnel assembly could be placed in a rack to dry without handling the FFR.\nSchematic of the droplet loading method.\nData analysis and statistics\nFiltration efficiencies for the FFR models were calculated from the percent aerosol penetration values (%P) generated by the TSI Model 8130 AFT (filtration efficiency  = 100 - %P). Control and experimental FFR filtration efficiencies were compared using a t-Test: Paired Two Sample for Means (Microsoft Excel 2007).\nThe repeatability of the MS2 application technique (spray bottle) used to contaminate the FFRs was assessed using ASTM Standard E2721-10. For each FFR model within each steam bag group (MSB X and MSB Y), the coefficient of variation (CV) of MS2 contamination was calculated as the ratio of the standard deviation to the mean plaque forming units (pfu) per respirator and expressed as a percentage. A CV &lt;=40% is the quality objective for contaminating materials described in ASTM Standard E2721. The same quality objective was used to evaluate a sophisticated device to apply virus droplets to FFRs. That study found that CV values of &lt;40% were achievable, but FFR design characteristics (shape, size, flexibility) affect repeatability.\nThe antiviral activity of the steam bags was determined for each FFR model by comparing the average log10 pfu of MS2 loaded onto three untreated (control) FFR samples with three steam-treated FFR samples. Percent reduction was also calculated for a given FFR model by dividing the number of recovered pfu from a treated respirator by the average pfu recovered from the untreated controls. The quotients calculated using the three treated samples were averaged to give average percent reduction.\nCompeting Interests: The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.\nFunding: This work was supported by internal funds from the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), part of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. NIOSH employees were involved in conducting the study, analyzing the results, and preparing the manuscript.\nReferences\nReusability of facemasks during an influenza pandemic: facing the flu.\nProposed guidance on workplace stockpiling of respirators and facemasks for pandemic influenza.\nDevelopment of a test system to apply virus-containing particles to filtering facepiece respirators for the evaluation of decontamination procedures.\nA Method to Determine the Available UV-C Dose for the Decontamination of Filtering Facepiece Respirators.\nThe effect of soil accumulation on multiple decontamination processing of N95 filtering facepiece respirator coupons using physical methods.\nA pandemic influenza preparedness study: use of energetic methods to decontaminate filtering facepiece respirators contaminated with H1N1 aerosols and droplets.\nEvaluation of the survivability of MS2 viral aerosols deposited on filtering face piece respirator samples incorporating antimicrobial technologies.\nEvaluation of five decontamination methods for filtering facepiece respirators.\nEffect of decontamination on the filtration efficiency of two filtering facepiece respirator models.\nDevelopment of a test system to evaluate procedures for decontamination of respirators containing viral droplets.\nAnalysis of Residual Chemicals on Filtering Facepiece Respirators After Decontamination.\nEvaluation of Multiple (3-Cycle) Decontamination Processing for Filtering Facepiece Respirators.\nDecontamination of filtration media for respiration.

Ultraviolet germicidal irradiation (UVGI) has been shown to be effective for decontaminating influenza-contaminated FFRs. This study aims to build on past research by evaluating the UVGI decontamination efficiency of influenza-contaminated FFRs in the presence of soiling agents using an optimized UVGI dose.\nMethods\nTwelve samples each of 15 N95 FFR models were contaminated with H1N1 influenza (facepiece and strap), then covered with a soiling agent:artificial saliva or artificial skin oil. For each soiling agent, 3 contaminated FFRs were treated with 1 J/cm2 UVGI for approximately 1 minute, whereas 3 other contaminated FFRs remained untreated. All contaminated surfaces were cut out and virus extracted. Viable influenza was quantified using a median tissue culture infectious dose assay.\nResults\nSignificant reductions (&gt;=3 log) in influenza viability for both soiling conditions were observed on facepieces from 12 of 15 FFR models and straps from 7 of 15 FFR models.\nConclusions\nThese data suggest that FFR decontamination and reuse using UVGI can be effective. Implementation of a UVGI method will require careful consideration of FFR model, material type, and design.\nRespiratory protection devices are crucial for limiting the spread of airborne infectious disease, protecting health care workers (HCWs), their patients, and other users during outbreaks. The use of N95 filtering facepiece respirators (FFRs) has been recommended for protection against pandemic influenza, severe acute respiratory syndrome, and emerging infectious diseases where aerosol transmission is considered possible. N95 FFRs are capable of capturing &gt;=95% of 0.3 microm airborne particles and generally are disposed of after a single use. Stockpiling of personal protective equipment, such as N95 FFRs, for influenza pandemic preparedness has been an area of focus since the emergence of H5N1 influenza in 2005 and the 2009 H1N1 pandemic. However, stockpiling goals for N95 FFR supplies may not meet the demand if a severe influenza pandemic were to occur. An estimated 60 million N95 FFRs are being held by US acute care hospitals collectively with state holdings varying from 14,000-32 million. Assuming 20%-30% of the US population became ill, the number of N95 FFRs needed could range from 1.7-7.3 billion during an influenza pandemic. FFR shortages for various health care facilities occurred during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, providing more validation that shortages are likely to occur during a severe pandemic. \nOne approach to mitigate a potential N95 shortage is to implement FFR decontamination and reuse (FFR-DR) strategies. FFR-DR aims to decontaminate FFRs without significantly affecting their performance. Recommendations for 2 types of supply conserving use strategies without decontamination are currently provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention: extended use and limited reuse. Extended use refers to the use of the same N95 FFR by the same wearer for multiple encounters with patients without doffing the respirator. Limited reuse refers to the use of the same N95 FFR for multiple encounters by the same wearer, but doffing after each encounter with restrictions in place to limit the number of times the same FFR is reused. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) specifies that use limitations for all filters on NIOSH-approved FFRs should consider hygiene, damage, and breathing resistance, and be replaced whenever they are damaged, soiled, or cause noticeably increased breathing resistance. Implementation of these reuse practices is up to the respiratory protection program's manager and is dependent on the respiratory pathogen's characteristics (eg, route of transmission and severity of illness) and local conditions (eg, number of N95 respirators available and use rate). Among the primary concerns for implementing an FFR extended use or limited reuse policy is the possibility of respirators becoming contaminated and subsequently acting as fomites, potentially spreading the disease. HCWs are well versed in self-contamination incidents that occurred during the severe acute respiratory syndrome and Ebola virus disease outbreaks and are concerned that extended use of FFRs may lead to self-infection. \nAlthough guidance for limited reuse and extended use of FFRs is currently available, implementation of FFR-DR strategies is a more complicated process. For reprocessed single-use medical devices, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) requires validation data regarding cleaning, sterilization, and functional performance. Cleaning is generally performed before decontamination to ensure soiling materials do not interfere with the decontamination process. The common definition of a cleaned device:no visual contamination is present:differs from the Medical Device User Fee and Modernization Act of 2002, which states that the reprocessor must establish cleaning end points and rationale for their selection. Cleaning FFRs is a difficult task because the N95 facepiece is an exposed filter and not compatible with standard laundering techniques. Additionally, research has been performed demonstrating that several FFR models cannot be effectively cleaned using various cleaning wipes. According to the Institute of Medicine, any method decontaminating a disposable N95 FFR must remove the pathogen, be harmless to the user, and not compromise the integrity of the various parts of the respirator. If the decontamination process can eliminate viable pathogens from the medical device in the presence of other organic material, the question arises of whether cleaning would still be required, especially during a public health emergency.\nSeveral studies have previously been performed evaluating the efficacy of FFR decontamination methods. Heimbuch et al evaluated 3 different energetic methods (microwave-generated steam [MGS], moist heat incubation [MHI], and ultraviolet germicidal irradiation [UVGI]) against H1N1 influenza-contaminated N95 FFRs. All 3 methods demonstrated &gt;4-log reductions in viable virus. The results were subsequently duplicated using low-pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza by Lore et al Fisher et al demonstrated &gt;4-log reductions in viable MS2 virus on FFR coupons using 0.6% sodium hypochlorite solution and MGS treatments  &gt;=45 seconds. Vo et al evaluated the disinfection efficiencies of sodium hypochlorite and UVGI on N95 respirators contaminated with droplets containing MS2 bacteriophage, and both approaches demonstrated multilog reductions in MS2 viability. Although there are currently no guidelines for the level of decontamination required for contaminated FFRs, multiple FFR-DR methods have shown significant reductions in virus viability. Currently, there are no published data on actual influenza contamination levels of FFRs in hospitals. However, Fisher et al validated a predictive model for estimating the level of influenza contamination on FFRs and surgical masks resulting from aerosols in a health care setting. The estimated contamination level for the entire external surface of an FFR ranged from 101-105 viruses, depending on different scenarios using airborne influenza concentrations published in the literature.\nThe study described herein is a continuation of the UVGI-based FFR decontamination research performed by Heimbuch et al in 2011. Although all 3 methods (MGS, MHI, and UVGI) demonstrated &gt;4-log reduction in viable virus, some methods may be better suited for hospital use than others. The MHI method required the longest decontamination time (30 minutes) and the use of an oven set to 160 F. The MGS method was the shortest decontamination time (2 minutes), but there may be concerns over wattage variability among microwave ovens. Although the UVGI method required a 15-minute decontamination period, this method may be most suitable for large-scale applications due to simplicity of use and ability to rapidly scale. UVGI technologies for whole-room decontamination have already been developed and are commercially available. Despite showing &gt;4-log reduction in viable influenza, some limitations of the study were subsequently identified. The study authors listed the primary limitation as being the low number of FFR models evaluated. Also, the ultraviolet (UV) light dose (concentration x time) could likely be optimized for hospital use by increasing the concentration of UV rays (ie, source and distance between the substrate and the UV light source), and reducing the time required to achieve decontamination, making the method more conducive to hospital use by minimizing logistical burden. Additionally, the 2011 study evaluated decontamination efficiency of influenza in the absence of soiling agents (ie, protective factors) that may shield the virus from the decontamination source. During real-world contamination events, influenza virus could very likely be shielded by organic soiling agents like saliva or skin oil, which can inhibit the effectiveness of decontamination techniques. \nThe objective of the current study was to evaluate the UVGI decontamination efficiency of an intact FFR contaminated with both a pandemic influenza strain and a soiling agent to better simulate real-world contamination events. Fifteen N95 FFR models were contaminated with viable H1N1 influenza and either artificial saliva or artificial skin oil, then subsequently treated with UV light and evaluated for remaining viable virus.\nMaterials and methods\nH1N1 influenza\nH1N1 influenza A/PR/8/34 (VR-1469; American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) was propagated in embryonic chicken eggs (Premium Specific Pathogen Free Eggs 10100326; Charles River Laboratories, Wilmington, MA) using standard World Health Organization protocols. Virus titers were determined by a 50% tissue culture infectious dose (TCID50) assay. Madin-Darby canine kidney cells (CCL-34; American Type Culture Collection) were passaged and maintained using World Health Organization-approved cell culture techniques.\nSoiling agents\nMucin buffer was prepared and stored at 4 C. Synthetic skin oil (Scientific Services S/D, Sparrow Bush, NY) was purchased, divided into 2.5-mL aliquots, and stored at 37 C until use. For testing, aliquots were heated to 70 C and poured into the base of a 100-mm Petri dish. Continual heat was applied until the layer became even and allowed to cool to room temperature.\nTest respirators\nN95 filtering facepiece respirators (FFRs) selected for this study\nTable 1	 	\nN95 FFR models	FFR shape	 	3M* 1860	Cup	 	3M* 1870	Flat-fold	 	3M* VFlex 1805	Flat-fold	 	Alpha Protech  695	Flat fold	 	Gerson  1730	Cup	 	Kimberly-Clark  PFR	Pouch	 	Moldex|| 1512	Cup	 	Moldex|| 1712	Flat-fold	 	Moldex|| EZ-22 	Cup	 	Precept# 65-3395	Cup	 	Prestige Ameritech** RP88020	Pouch	 	Sperian   HC-NB095	Cup	 	Sperian   HC-NB295F	Flat-fold	 	U.S. Safety   AD2N95A	Cup	 	U.S. Safety   AD4N95	Flat-fold	 	\n3M Company, Minneapolis, MN.\nAlpha Protech, Markham, Canada.\nLouis M.

(B) Side view.\nFig 1\nLocations of influenza droplets applied to filtering facepiece respirators.\nFig 2\nThe custom UVGI device was made of polished aluminum (Alloy 6061-T6 and Alloy 2024-T3; OnlineMetals.com, Seattle, WA) and measuring 40-in L x 16-in W x 13-in H with a tunnel extension measuring 18-in x 8-in W x 6-in H (Fig 1 ). The polished aluminum alloys were selected because they are UV reflective surfaces that do not alter the wavelength of the reflected light. Eight 32-in 254-nm UV-C bulbs with an irradiance of 0.39 W/cm2 at 1 m (Fresh-Aire UV; Jupiter, FL) were incorporated into the device to deliver a UV dose of 1 J/cm2 in approximately 1 minute (Fig 2 ). A sliding wire mesh rack was used to position the FFR during UV treatment. For temperature control, a cool air circulation system was incorporated into the device that consisted of an RTR-140 bath circulator (Neslab; Portsmouth, NH), 2 heat exchangers (AMS technologies, Martinsried, Germany), 2 80-mm 70-CFM double, ball-bearing, high-airflow fans (Vantec, Fremont, CA), and 5-in diameter polyvinyl chloride pipe.\nAn ILT-1254 radiometer (International Light Technologies, Peabody, MA), which measures 254-nm wavelengths, was used to measure UV output within the UVGI device. The UVGI device was initially validated by placing the radiometer in the same location as FFRs to be tested and taking UV measurements with the sensor facing upward, then on each side. UV measurements were then taken from the radiometer location shown in Figure 1, where UV output will be monitored for each test. The initial ratio in UV output between the 2 locations measured during the UVGI device validation was used to convert measurements taken during FFR testing to determine the UV dose per respirator. An OM-EL-USB-2 temperature and humidity data logger (Omega Engineering, Inc, Stamford, CT) was used to monitor environmental conditions within the device.\nDecontamination studies\nFor each N95 FFR model, 12 intact FFRs were aseptically inoculated with 10 1-microL droplets of H1N1 influenza within a 2 cm2 area on 4 areas of each FFR, delivering 7 log10 TCID50 to each area. Each FFR was inoculated in the same 4 areas: the top, middle, and bottom of the facepiece's exterior (from the perspective of a donned FFR), and the strap (Fig 2). Inoculated surfaces were allowed to dry at room temperature in a biosafety cabinet for approximately 10 minutes.\nTwo conditions were evaluated: artificial saliva (mucin buffer) and artificial skin oil (sebum). Five 1-microL droplets of mucin buffer were applied directly over each dried influenza inoculation, allowing approximately 10 minutes of drying between droplet applications. A synthetic sebum overlay was prepared by pipetting 2.5 mL liquefied sebum into a 100-mm Petri dish, which was then swirled to create an even monolayer. A sterile triangle-shaped spreader was used to collect the sebum from the Petri dish. The collected sebum was then spread over the inoculum area at a density of approximately 1.25 mg/cm2.\nEach condition evaluated 6 influenza-contaminated FFRs. Three FFRs were each placed inside the UVGI device and individually treated for 60-70 seconds at an irradiance of approximately 17 mW/cm2, resulting in a dose of ~1 J/cm2. This dose was based on preliminary optimization studies using FFR coupons. The UV dose is monitored during each test to ensure consistent treatment across experiments. Inoculated control masks were held at room temperature in a class II biosafety cabinet enclosure until the treated masks completed UVGI treatment.\nAfter UV treatment, FFRs were transferred to a class II biosafety cabinet for processing. Inoculated areas on the FFR facepiece were removed using a 1.5-in circular die and placed in 50-mL centrifuge tubes containing 15 mL serum-free Eagle's minimum essential medium (EMEM). The FFR straps were cut at their points of attachment to the FFR, and each was placed in a 50 mL centrifuge tube containing 15 mL serum-free EMEM and vortexed for 20 minutes to extract the influenza virus. Extracts were subsequently serially diluted in serum-free EMEM and plated in quadruplicate in 24-well plates with confluent monolayers of Madin-Darby canine kidney cells, according to the World Health Organization protocol for a TCID50 assay. Plates were then incubated at 37 C in 5% carbon dioxide for 7 days. After the incubation period, each well was observed under a microscope for cytopathic effects, generally demonstrated by a disruption of the cell monolayer. Plates were subsequently stained with crystal violet-glutaraldehyde to confirm the presence of cytopathic effects.\nData analysis\nUV dose was calculated based on standard methods for mathematical modeling of UV light using Equation 1: \nTo determine the level of viable virus recovered from each sampled location, the Spearman-Karber formula was used to interpret the TCID50 assay data. To perform statistical analyses, Environmental Protection Agency guidance using half the detection limit (0.20 log10 TCID50) for below-detection limit values was followed. An unpaired, 2-tailed t test was used to compare UV-treated and control virus recoveries, as well as log reduction values for FFR facepieces and straps. Data were analyzed using statistical tools in GraphPad Prism 6 (Graph Pad Inc, La Jolla, CA).\nResults\nAcross all 180 FFRs tested, the mean UV dose per FFR was 1.1 +- 0.1 J/cm2, the mean temperature was 21 C  +- 2 C, and the mean relative humidity was 48% +- 6% within the UV device.\nMucin-soiled FFRs\nViable virus recovered from mucin-soiled N95 respirators. Respirator manufacturers were 3M Company, Minneapolis, MN; Alpha Protech, Markham, Canada; Louis M.

For mucin-soiled facepieces, the mean viable virus recovered from UV-treated samples was statistically significantly lower (P &lt; .05) than control samples for all FFR models tested. For mucin-soiled straps, the mean viable virus recovered from UV-treated samples was statistically significantly lower than control samples for all FFR models tested except the VFlex 1805 (3M Company, Maplewood, MN), Alpha Protech 695 (Alpha Protech, Markham Canada), Moldex EZ 22, and the U.S. Safety AD2N95A (Dentech Safety Specialists, Lenexa, KS). The log reduction values observed for all mucin-soiled FFR straps were statistically significantly lower than their respective FFR facepieces.\nSebum-soiled FFRs\nViable virus recovered from sebum-soiled N95 respirators. Respirator manufacturers were 3M Company, Minneapolis, MN; Alpha Protech, Markham, Canada; Louis M. Gerson Co, Inc, Middleboro, MA; Kimberley-Clark Corp, Irving, TX; Moldex, Culver City, CA; Precept Medical Products, Inc, Arden, NC; Prestige Ameritech, North Richland Hills, TX; Honeywell Safety Products USA, Smithfield, RI; and Dentech Safety Specialists, Lenexa, KS.\nFig 4\nFor sebum-soiled FFR facepieces, the mean viable influenza recovered from control surfaces was 4.10 +- 0.56 log TCID50; for sebum-soiled FFR straps, the mean viable influenza recovered from control surfaces was 3.90 +- 0.65 log TCID50 (Fig 4 ).\nThe mean log reduction ranged from 1.25-4.64 log TCID50 for sebum-soiled facepieces and 0.08-4.40 log TCID50 for sebum-soiled straps. For sebum-soiled facepieces, the mean viable virus recovered from UV-treated samples was significantly lower than control samples for all FFR models tested. For sebum-soiled straps, the mean viable virus recovered from UV-treated samples was significantly lower than control samples for all FFR models tested except the 3M 1860, Alpha Protech, and Moldex EZ 22.The log reduction values observed for the sebum-soiled FFR straps were significantly lower than the respective FFR facepieces.\nDiscussion\nIn this study, evaluation of the UVGI decontamination method focused on log reduction rather than total absence of viable virus because the viral challenge was selected to far exceed what would may occur during a real-world contamination event. Based on the Fisher et al model predicting influenza contamination levels of FFRs in hospitals from aerosol sources, the highest estimated contamination level (105 virus/FFR) would result in a loading concentration of 103 virus/cm2 for a 200-cm2 FFR, requiring a 3-log reduction to fully decontaminate. The virus loading concentration used in the current study is approximately 100-times higher than the loading concentration resulting from the highest contamination level estimated by Fisher et al. Maximizing the loading concentration is important for laboratory studies in order to generate a measurable log reduction and overcome the virus loss resulting from variable extraction efficiencies of different materials, potential loss of viability due to environmental exposure, and the detection limit of the log-based viable assay (~0.50 TCID50).\nCompared with the Heimbuch et al 2011 study that evaluated 6 FFR models, the current study provides a broader view of the diversity among FFR models currently available on the market. Across the 15 FFR models evaluated for this study there are considerable differences in FFR facepiece design, varying in overall shape (eg, cup, flat-fold, or pouch), material composition, and other design features (eg, pleats and flaps). Variability in design between FFR models has the potential to influence the effectiveness of FFR-DR strategies, making it important to understand which design attributes may be less or more advantageous for a given decontamination method. Reductions in virus viability &gt;=3 log were considered significant because a 3-log reduction would be required to fully disinfect an FFR contaminated with the highest level of influenza contamination predicted by the Fisher et al model. Significant reductions in influenza viability were observed on both mucin- and sebum-soiled facepieces for 12 of 15 FFR models post-UV treatment. The 3 remaining FFR models:Gerson 1730 (Louis M. Gerson Co, Inc, Middleboro, MA), Sperian HC-NB095 (Honeywell Safety Products USA, Smithfield, RI), and U.S. Safety AD2N95A:still demonstrated statistically significant reductions in virus viability. The facepieces from these 3 FFR models are relatively similar in appearance:white, cup-shaped, with slightly rough texture. The Gerson 1730 and U.S. Safety AD2N95A facepieces both appear to be hydrophilic, as indicated by the immediate absorption of the liquid inocula, whereas the Sperian HC-NB095 appears to be hydrophobic. Absorption of the viral inoculum away from the surface could potentially limit the UVGI decontamination efficiency because UV light is primarily effective for surface decontamination. Although the Sperian HC-NB095 facepieces did not appear hydrophilic, the relatively low log reduction may be attributed to the presence of horizontal ridges across the front of the facepieces, which may have created small shadowing effects while the mask was exposed to UV light. In general, the presence of shadows indicates the blocking of UV light, thus inhibiting UVGI efficiency. Although the data demonstrate UVGI can be effective, additional research would be required to define how specific FFR design attributes may influence UVGI efficiency, either individually or in combination.\nSimilar to the variability observed with FFR facepieces, FFR straps also vary in design (eg, material type, thickness, width, and elasticity), which may influence the effectiveness of FFR decontamination methods. Significant reductions in virus viability were observed for both mucin- and sebum-soiled straps from 7 of 15 FFR models post-UV treatment, whereas 5 FFR models demonstrated &lt;3-log reductions for both soiling agents. Of these 5 FFR models, 4 models:3M 1860, U.S. Safety AD2N95A, Moldex EZ 22, and Alpha Protech 695:appear to have hydrophilic straps and thus absorption of the virus away from the surface could potentially limit UVGI effectiveness. As with FFR facepieces, shadowing during UVGI treatment could also influence the UVGI effectiveness on FFR straps. The presence of shadows are likely a greater concern for FFR straps than FFR facepieces due to their propensity to twist and orientation based on how much slack is available. Ultimately, FFR straps pose a logistic challenge for UVGI decontamination strategies. This is a significant finding because proper doffing techniques for FFRs require handling of the straps, increasing the likelihood of fomite transfer. Thus, FFRs with straps that are amenable to UVGI disinfection would be preferred. Unlike the facepiece component, straps could potentially be disinfected using a disinfecting wipe or similar approach, but determining the effectiveness of these methods would require additional research outside the scope of this study.\nAddressing a limitation of the 2011 Heimbuch et al study, soiling agents were used to shield the virus inocula, acting as protective factors. UVGI effectiveness has been shown to correlate with soil load, decreasing in disinfection efficiency as the soil load increases. As previously mentioned, the levels of sebum and mucin buffer used were intentionally high to act as a worst-case scenario. Pochi and Strauss measured casual sebum levels of 51 male subjects with and without acne to determine a cause-and-effect relationship. They found that subjects with severe acne had a mean density of 0.18 +- 0.08 mg/cm2 sebum on their face based on the samples taken. Compared with the sebum level of subjects with acne, the sebum challenge used in this study is approximately a 7-fold increase. For mucin buffer, 5 loadings were used for each influenza droplet to provide multilayered shielding against UVGI. Although the level of soiling agents used in this study may be considered excessive and thus a limitation, significant reductions in viable influenza were still observed for both soiling agents, indicating UVGI decontamination of influenza could be performed in the absence of cleaning.\nOther potential limitations of the current research effort were identified. For the purposes of this study, only the exterior surface of the facemask was evaluated for UVGI effectiveness. If implemented in a hospital setting, a UVGI application would likely need to treat both the interior and exterior FFR surfaces, accounting for potential contamination resulting from either the environment or the user. Additionally, the soiling agents used were artificial and thus a difference in UVGI effectiveness between artificial and natural soiling agents could potentially occur. There was also some loss in viable virus between the inoculation and extraction of control samples. The source of this reduced fraction of viable virus could be attributed to natural decay of the virus or influenced by the material's extraction efficiency; the effect of either factor is unclear.\nThe study described herein addresses a significant concern for HCWs during an influenza pandemic:the unavailability of N95 FFRs. Although FFR-DR is a possible mitigation strategy for a potential N95 shortage, the research related to FFR-DR methodology is limited. If implemented, an FFR-DR strategy should not only be effective against the pathogen of concern while maintaining the respirator's performance specifications, but also must be compatible with HCW operations and logistics to be successful. This study demonstrates significant reductions in viable influenza under substantial soiling conditions after being exposed to ~1-minute UVGI treatment. UVGI-based FFR-DR would allow hospitals to treat FFRs in a quick and efficient manner, benefiting HCWs during a potential influenza pandemic. Follow-up research to better understand the effect of multiple UVGI cycles on N95 respirator durability and performance using the current study's conditions has also been performed and will be submitted for publication. Additionally, future work evaluating the effectiveness of UVGI on contaminated respirators under conditions that more closely resemble real-world contamination events would be beneficial.\nConclusions\nThe results of this study indicate FFR-DR can be effective. Building on the Heimbuch et al 2011 study, this study evaluated the decontamination efficiency of an optimized UVGI dose (1 J/cm2) delivered to an intact FFR contaminated with both H1N1 influenza and a soiling agent. Significant reductions in influenza viability (&gt;=3 log) were observed for both soiling conditions (artificial saliva and artificial skin oil) on UVGI-treated facepieces from 12 of 15 FFR models and UVGI-treated straps from 7 of 15 FFR models. Log reductions were considered significant based on the decontamination efficiency required to fully disinfect the highest level of influenza contamination on FFRs predicted by Fisher et al. For FFR-DR, FFR facepieces pose the greatest challenge for disinfection, whereas FFR straps can likely be disinfected through alternative means (eg, disinfecting wipes). Implementation of a UVGI method will likely require careful consideration of FFR material type and design. These data are critically important for regulators and hospitals to understand whether UVGI-based FFR-DR technologies are being considered for deployment in the event of an influenza pandemic. They also provide the basis for future design of new FFR models that are highly amenable to FFR-DR.\nReferences\nPandemic Influenza Preparedness and Response Guidance for Healthcare Workers and Healthcare Employers\nInterim Domestic Guidance on the Use of Respirators to Prevent Transmission of SARS\nB95: A new respirator for health care personnel\nNIOSH Guide to the Selection and Use of Particulate Respirators\nStockpiling supplies for the next influenza pandemic [online report]\nPrevalence of respiratory protective devices in U.S. health care facilities: implications for emergency preparedness\nPotential demand for respirators and surgical masks during a hypothetical influenza pandemic in the United States\nAPIC Position Paper: Extending the Use and/or Reusing Respiratory Protection in Healthcare Settings During Disasters\nFacial protective equipment, personnel, and pandemics: impact of the pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus on personnel and use of facial protective equipment\nEvaluation of respiratory protection programs and practices in California hospitals during the 2009-2010 H1N1 Influenza Pandemic\nRecommended Guidance for Extended Use and Limited Reuse of N95 Filtering Facepiece Respirators in Healthcare Settings\nConsiderations for recommending extended use and limited reuse of filtering facepiece respirators in health care settings\nVirus transfer from personal protective equipment to healthcare employees' skin and clothing\nSARS Transmission among hospital workers in Hong Kong\nMedical Device User Fee and Modernization Act 2002 (MDUFMA)\nGuidance for Industry and FDA Staff: Medical Device User Fee and Modernization Act of 2002, Validation Data in Premarket Notification Submissions (510(k)s) for Reprocessed Single-Use Medical Devices\nCleaning of filtering facepiece respirators contaminated with mucin and Staphylococcus aureus\nA pandemic influenza preparedness study: use of energetic methods to decontaminate filtering facepiece respirators contaminated with H1N1 aerosols and droplets\nEffectiveness of three decontamination treatments against influenza virus applied to filtering facepiece respirators\nDevelopment of a test system to apply virus-containing particles to filtering facepiece respirators for the evaluation of decontamination procedures\nDevelopment of a test system to evaluate procedures for decontamination of respirators containing viral droplets\nValidation and application of models to predict facemask influenza contamination in healthcare settings\nHelix 450XL Total Room UV Sanitizer\nSanitaire  ultraviolet room air sanitizer\nInfection Prevention Technologies\nGuideline for Disinfection and Sterilization in Healthcare Facilities\nAssessment of half-mask elastomeric respirator and powered air-purifying respirator reprocessing for an influenza pandemic\nThe effect of soil accumulation on multiple decontamination processing of N95 filtering facepiece respirator coupons using physical methods\nWHO Manual on Animal Influenza Diagnosis and Surveillance\nUltraviolet Germicidal Irradiation of Influenza-Contaminated N95 Filtering Facepiece Respirators\nRobust estimation of mean and variance using environmental data sets with below detection limit observations\nSebum production, casual sebum levels, titratable acidity of sebum, and urinary fractional 17-ketosteroid excretion in males with acne\nSupported by the  (contract No. HHSF223201400158C).

inactivation of SARS coronavirus","abstract":"The SARS-coronavirus (SARS-CoV) is a newly emerged, highly pathogenic agent that caused over 8,000 human infections with nearly 800 deaths between November 2002 and September 2003. While direct person-to-person transmission via respiratory droplets accounted for most cases, other modes have not been ruled out.\n Faecal shedding is common and prolonged and has caused an outbreak in Hong Kong.\n We studied the stability of SARS-CoV under different conditions, both in suspension and dried on surfaces, in comparison with other human-pathogenic viruses, including human coronavirus HCoV-229E.\n In suspension, HCoV-229E gradually lost its infectivity completely while SARS-CoV retained its infectivity for up to 9 days; in the dried state, survival times were 24 h versus 6 days.\n Thermal inactivation at 56°C was highly effective in the absence of protein, reducing the virus titre to below detectability; however, the addition of 20% protein exerted a protective effect resulting in residual infectivity.\n If protein-containing solutions are to be inactivated, heat treatment at 60°C for at least 30 min must be used.\n Different fixation procedures, e.\ng.\n for the preparation of immunofluorescence slides, as well as chemical means of virus inactivation commonly used in hospital and laboratory settings were generally found to be effective.\n Our investigations confirm that it is possible to care for SARS patients and to conduct laboratory scientific studies on SARS-CoV safely.\n Nevertheless, the agent’s tenacity is considerably higher than that of HCoV-229E, and should SARS re-emerge, increased efforts need to be devoted to questions of environmental hygiene.\n","id":"PMC7086689","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Springer-Verlag","authors":[{"firstname":"H.

of mask, gloves, gowns, and hand-washing, as recommended under droplets and contact precautions when caring for index patients with SARS.\n 69 staff who reported use of all four measures were not infected, whereas all infected staff had omitted at least one measure (p=0·0224).\n Fewer staff who wore masks (p=0·0001), gowns (p=0·006), and washed their hands (p=0·047) became infected compared with those who didn't, but stepwise logistic regression was significant only for masks (p=0·011).\n Practice of droplets precaution and contact precaution is adequate in significantly reducing the risk of infection after exposures to patients with SARS.\n The protective role of the mask suggests that in hospitals, infection is transmitted by droplets.\n","id":"PMC7112437","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Elsevier

It is caused by a novel Corona virus (nCoV), a member of family Coronaviridae, now renamed as SARS-CoV-2. Transmission of this virus occurs through direct, contact and airborne routes, latter particularly when aerosol generating procedures (AGPs) are done during patient care. Consequently, healthcare workers (HCWs) require a full set of personal protective equipment (PPE) including gowns, gloves, facemasks, face-shields or goggles and respirators for their protection during patient care, particularly in intensive care unit settings where AGPs are done regularly. This has created an unprecedented demand for PPEs leading to their global shortage forcing administrative authorities to relook the recommendations of PPE usage in a whole new light. Previously, focus of PPE use strategy was not to share them between patients however, due to this unprecedented crisis, it has radically shifted to optimizing the use of PPEs, their extended use and limited reuse. Respiratory protection is one of the fundamental rights of any employee in workplace. In healthcare settings, HCWs need to be protected against bioaerosols at all costs, which at minimum, is offered by use of N95 Filtering Facepiece Respirator (N95-FFR). These FFRs have a class of filters which is not resistant to degradation by oil and is able to remove 95% particles of 0.3 mum in size, at minimum. They are single use devices ought to be discarded after use to avoid self-inoculation &amp; cross-contamination.\nShortage of FFRs is not new, pangs of which were first felt during Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak in 2003. The possibility was also predicted for an impending Influenza pandemic consequent to which U.S. Strategic National Stockpile had plans for providing 100 million N95-FFRs nationally, but it was deemed insufficient in event of a longer pandemic. Hence, in 2006, Institute of Medicine (IOM) constituted a committee to address reusability of facemasks. Reuse of an FFR was defined as repeatedly donning and doffing of respirator by the same wearer, with or without undergoing reprocessing in between, till it is discarded. The committee recommended reuse of respirators in the event of acute shortage provided they are not obviously damaged or soiled. However, committee specified that no method exists currently for reprocessing of N95-FFRs and identified it as a research priority. Consequently, various research groups began their quest to search a reprocessing method which is efficacious against respiratory pathogens, is safe for human use and maintains the integrity of various components of the respirator. Even after a decade of research, prior to COVID-19 pandemic, no method has been recommended for reprocessing of N95-FFRs. Hence, we conducted this systematic review to determine the status of research done, prior to COVID-19 pandemic, to identify technologies which can be utilized for reprocessing of N95-FFRs in present situation and can be explored in near future to tackle the global crisis of respirator shortage.\nMethods\nWe report this systematic review (PROSPERO ID: CRD42020189684) in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines and checklist is provided in S1 Table.\nSearch strategy\nWe searched five databases-Pubmed, Google Scholar, Crossref, Ovid and ScienceDirect in May 2020. Grey literature was searched using OpenGrey repository. Search strategies employing combinations of various keywords is provided in S2 Table. Searches in Google Scholar and Crossref were done using Publish or Perish 7 software (Harzing, A.W. 2007) to limit article hits and sort relevant ones. Additionally, we manually searched the back references of included studies and relevant review articles on the topic to identify further eligible studies. Articles in languages other than English were considered only when their abstracts were available in English.\nEligibility criteria\nOriginal research articles in any language, which evaluated a single or multiple decontamination or reprocessing methods on N95-FFRs were eligible for analysis in this study. Exclusion criteria were (i) Abstracts, posters, review articles, book chapters, letters, guidelines, point of views (ii) articles published in year 2020 and (iii) involving reprocessing or decontamination of other types of masks or respirators such as Gauze, Cloth, Spun-lace, Elastomeric and Powered-air-purifying, only.\nData extraction\nAfter searching all databases, we exported data in Microsoft  Excel and removed duplicates. Two reviewers (DP &amp; AG) screened titles to remove clearly irrelevant studies. All three reviewers (AG, DP, AKM) independently screened the abstracts and full text of remaining articles to determine final eligibility and resolved any discrepancies through discussion and consensus. After included studies were finalized, data on various variables such as reprocessing method exposure variables, number, type and replicates of FFR models, parameters which were evaluated and final results was entered in Microsoft  Excel independently by all three reviewers. Extracted data was checked and analysed by one reviewer (AG) and disagreements were resolved prior to final analysis.\nQuality assessment\nTo assess methodological quality and risk bias of studies, a self-developed tool was designed on the basis of STROBE statement due to unavailability of a validated quality assessment tool for such studies. Two authors (AKM and DP) independently assessed the methodological quality and risk bias as per tool. The scheme of scoring and grading of studies is given in S3 Table along with the final quality assessment results. Inter-author concordance on grading of studies was evaluated by third author (AG). Final quality assessment results for included studies, as shown in S3 Table, were prepared by resolving inter-author disagreements by discussion and building consensus.\nResults\nSearch results\nOur search strategy identified 7887 records of which 17 original research articles fit inclusion criteria for qualitative analysis, methodology of the same has been described in Fig 1. No records were found in OpenGrey database using search strategy.\nSummary of search, selection and inclusion process.\nExcluded studies Abbreviations: FFR: Filtering Facepiece Respirator, n: Number.\nQuality assessment\nOf 17 studies, 14 were graded as high quality and 3 as moderate quality (S3 Table). Inter-author agreement in grading of studies was 88% (15/17). Overall agreement in quality assessment scores was 64% (11/17).\nStudy characteristics\nAmongst 17 included studies, 15 were conducted in U.S. and 2 in Taiwan. Ten out of 15 studies were conducted by research groups from NIOSH as the principal investigator, 4 by researchers at Applied Research Associates (ARA) in collaboration with Air Force Research Laboratory at Tyndall Air Force Base, Panama City and in 1 study, principal investigators were from University of Nebraska (UoN). Three studies were an outcome of collaboration between NIOSH, ARA &amp; UoN in various combinations. Two studies from Taiwan were conducted by same researchers at Department of Occupational Safety and Health, Chung Shan Medical University. First study evaluating reprocessing methods for FFRs was published in 2007 and last study in 2018.\nDecontamination/reprocessing methods\nOverall, 21 different types of decontamination or reprocessing methods for N95-FFRs were evaluated in included studies against various parameters namely physical changes, user acceptability, respirator fit, filter efficiency, microbicidal efficacy and presence of chemical residues post-reprocessing. Number of studies conducted for each reprocessing method, on these parameters are given in Fig 2. Overall, these studies evaluated 9 Physical (Energetic) reprocessing methods namely Ultraviolet (UV-C) Irradiation (UVGI), UV-A, UV-B, Moist heat delivered using Microwave generated Steam (MGS), Lab Incubator (MHI) and Autoclave (MHA), Dry heat delivered by Microwave (MGI), Hot Air Oven (DHO) and Traditional Electric Rice Cooker (TERC); 3 Gaseous chemical decontamination methods namely Hydrogen Peroxide Gas Plasma (HPGP), Hydrogen Peroxide Vapor (HPV) and Ethylene Oxide (EO); 6 Liquid chemical decontamination methods namely Bleach, Hydrogen Peroxide (LHP), Alcohols, Mixed Oxidants, Dimethyl dioxirane and Soap &amp; water; and in one study, wipes of Bleach (0.9%), Benzalkonium chloride and Inert substance for surface decontamination of N95-FFRs. Fourteen (14) studies did comparative evaluation of multiple methods for reprocessing of FFRs whereas in 3 studies only 1 method was evaluated, which was UVGI in all. In 12 studies, intact respirators were exposed to the decontamination method whereas in 5, cut pieces of facepiece portion were exposed. Furthermore, in one study, pieces of straps were also exposed separately to UVGI. In 4 studies, FFRs underwent multiple cycles (3 in all studies) of decontamination for reprocessing.\nSummary of studies [Total Number, n[Reference] conducted, prior to 2020, on various parameters related to reprocessing of N95 Filtering Facepiece Respirators (FFRs).\nColoured cells represent cumulative results of these studies (See Legend Below). Numbers in each coloured cells represent total number of studies conducted on a reprocessing method: parameter combination. Numbers in Parentheses denote the reference number of studies. Green Cells: Evidence shows no negative effect of the reprocessing method on the evaluated parameter. Red Cells: Evidence shows a negative effect of the reprocessing method on the evaluated parameter. Orange Cells: Evidence shows an effect which is either in conflict in different studies or requires careful consideration. Grey Cells: No study done on the reprocessing method: parameter combination. * User Acceptability is a composite parameter including odor, wear comfort &amp; donning ease. References 14,16,27 only evaluated odor. alpha- Fisher et al 2011 used Commercial steam bags for generation of steam, other studies used a water reservoir. beta- Ethanol (70%) and Isopropyl alcohol (70% and 100%) were used. Abbreviations: UVGI: Ultraviolet Irradiation (Type-C, 254 nm), MGS: Microwave Generated Steam, MHI: Moist heat Incubation in Lab Incubator, MHA: Moist Heat in Autoclave, DHO: Dry Heat in Oven (Till 80 C), TERC: Traditional Electric Rice Cooker, EO: Ethylene Oxide, HPGP: Hydrogen Peroxide Gas Plasma, HPV: Hydrogen Peroxide Vapor, LHP: Liquid Hydrogen Peroxide, BAC: Benzalkonium Chloride. Note: The summary is only indicative of the collective results of various studies done (prior to 2020) to evaluate effect of reprocessing method on a particular parameter. It doesn't attempt to endorse or refute any method as the authors strongly believe that there is insufficient data to reach any conclusion.\nRespirator models\nIn 10 of 17 studies, the identities of N95-FFR models used was disclosed, details of which against the reprocessing method and parameters evaluated are given in S4 Table. Overall, 23 different models of N95-FFRs were disclosed in 10 studies, 19 of which are approved as surgical respirators by FDA, whereas 4 are Particulate respirators. All respirators used in these studies, irrespective of whether identities were disclosed or not, were NIOSH approved. 3M1860, 3M1870 &amp; 3M8210 were the most commonly used N95-FFRs, each being used in 5 studies. 3M1860 &amp; 3M1870, both surgical respirators were tested against three reprocessing methods i.e. UVGI, MGS and MHI, where identity was disclosed whereas 3M8210, a particulate respirator was exposed to 7 different reprocessing methods. Furthermore, in 2 studies, P100 respirators were also evaluated but in both identities were not disclosed.\nDecontamination methods\nA. Physical (Energetic) methods\ni. Ultra-Violet Irradiation (UVGI). Thirteen studies evaluated exposure to UV-C (254 nm) as a reprocessing method for FFRs, as shown in Fig 2. All 23 known models of N95-FFRs were reprocessed using UV-C in at least one study (S4 Table). Furthermore, one study each also examined the microbiological efficacy of UV-A and presence of chemical residues after using UV-B. Exposure variables of UVGI (UV-C) on N95-FFRs and summary of results are provided in Table 1. Different parameters evaluated against UVGI are detailed in Fig 2. Overall, UVGI has shown to be microbiologically efficacious, preserve physical appearance of FFRs &amp; their filter efficiency, acceptable to users in terms of odor, donning ease and wear comfort, maintain respirator fit and devoid of any toxic residues post-exposure. UVGI has shown to preserve filter efficiency &amp; achieve adequate microbicidal efficacy post-exposure in 9 &amp; 18 different N95-FFR models, respectively, where identity of models was disclosed.\nSummary of characteristics of studies using Ultraviolet Irradiation (UVGI) as a reprocessing method for N95-FFRs.\nAuthors (Year)		Variables of UVGI Irradiation	Variables of FFRs	Results	 	Type	Irradiance (mW/cm2)	Duration	Dose (J/cm2)	Sides Exposed to UVGI	No. of Cycle	Total no. of Models used	Part of FFR exposed to UVGI	Repli-cates	Parameters Assessed	Summary of Results	 	Bergman et al (2010)	C	1.8	45 m	-	Outer (Convex)	3	6	Intact	3	Physical Changes	No observable physical changes on FFRs	 	Odor	No comment on odor	 	Filter Efficiency	Expected levels of Filter Aerosol penetration (&lt;5%) &amp; filter airflow resistance	 	Lore et al (2012)	C	1.6-2.2	15 m	1.8	Outer (Convex)	1	2	Intact	9	Filter Efficiency	No significant degradation of filter performance	 	Microbicidal Efficacy	&gt;4 log10 TCID50/ml reduction of H5N1 Avian Influenza virus	 	Viscusi et al (2009)	C	0.18-0.2	30 m	0.17-0.18	Each side	1	9	Intact	3	Physical Changes	No observable physical changes on FFRs	 	Filter Efficiency	Didn't affect Filter efficiency	 	Lindsley et al (2015)	C			120, 240, 470, 950 (For mask layers);	NA	1	4	Facepiece Coupons and Straps	4	Structural Integrity	Strengths of respirator materials was substantially reduced (in some cases&gt;90%)	 	Filter Efficiency	Slight increase in particle penetration but no effect on airflow resistance	 	590, 1180, 2360 (For straps, each side)	 	Mills et al (2018)	C	17	60-70 s	1	Outer (Convex)	1	15	Intact	3	Microbicidal Efficacy	&gt;=3 log10 TCID50/ml reduction in Influenza virus (H1N1) viability on 12/15 FFR models and straps from 7/15 FFR models	 	Heimbuch et al (2011)	C	1.6-2.2	15 m	1.8	Outer (Convex)	1	6	Intact	3	Physical Changes	No observable physical changes on FFRs	 	Microbicidal Efficacy	&gt;4 log10 TCID50/ml reduction of Influenza virus (H1N1)	 	Viscusi et al (2011)	C	1.8	30 m	-	Each side	3	6	Intact	2	Physical Changes	No observable physical changes on FFR	 	No clinically meaningful reduction in respirator fit, increase in odor, increase in discomfort or increased difficulty in donning	 	User Acceptability	 	Respirator Fit	 	Viscusi et al (2007)	C	0.24	15/ 240 m	-	Each side	1	2	Intact	4	Physical Changes	No observable physical changes on FFRs	 	Filter Efficiency	Not significantly affected by both time durations on both types of FFRs (N95 and P100)	 	Bergman et al (2011)	C	1.8	15 m	-	Outer (Convex)	3	3	Intact	2	Physical Changes	No observable physical changes on FFRs	 	Respirator Fit	No significant changes in Respirator fit	 	Fisher et al (2010)	C	2.5	1, 2, 4, 10 m on 3M 8210,1870	0.03, 0.1 &amp; 0.3 on Wilson, 3M 1860 and KC	Each side	1	6	Facepiece Coupons	3	IFM specific dose for	Log Reduction of MS2 Coliphage is a function of FFR model specific IFM UV-C dose	 	10m on Cardinal N95-ML	Microbicidal Efficacy	 	Lin et al (2018)	C	18.9	1, 2, 5, 10, 20 m	-	NA	1	1	Cut pieces	3	Microbicidal Efficacy	99-100% biocidal efficacy against Bacillus subtilis spores	 	Vo et al (2009)	C	0.4	1, 2, 3, 4, 5 hr	1.44, 2.88, 4.32, 5.76, 7.2	One side	1	1	Intact	3	Microbicidal Efficacy	3 log reduction of MS2 Coliphage at dose of 4.32 J/cm2 and complete removal at dose of &gt;=7.2 J/cm2	 	Salter et al (2010)	C	3.4	1 hr	27	NA	1	6	Coupons, straps,	3	Presence of Toxic Chemical residues Post-exposure	No toxic residues post-exposure	 	Nose cushion,	 	Nose pieces	 	Lin et al (2018)	A	31.2	1, 2,5, 10, 20 m	-	Each side	1	1	Cut pieces	3	Microbicidal Efficacy	Poor Microbicidal efficacy against Bacillus subtilis spores	 	Salter et al (2010)	B	4	1 hr	-	NA	1	6	Coupons, straps, nose cushion,	3	Presence of Toxic Chemical residues Post-exposure	No toxic residues post-exposure	 	Nose pieces	 	\nABBREVIATIONS: mW/cm2: milli Watt per square centimetre, J/cm2: Joules per square centimetre m: Minute, NA: Not Applicable, FFR: Filtering Facepiece Respirator, TCID: Tissue Culture Infectious Dose, s: Seconds IFM: Internal Filtering Media, hr: Hour\nii. Moist heat. Delivering moist heat to FFRs has been evaluated in 10 studies. Modalities of exposure involved exposing FFRs to steam created in a microwave (MGS), either by using water reservoir or commercial steam bags; in a lab incubator with a water reservoir heated at 60-70 C (MHI) and by autoclaving at 121 C (MHA). Parameters evaluated for these treatments are given in Fig 2 and the exposure variables and results of individual studies are described in Table 2. Known FFR models which underwent reprocessing by both MGS and MHI were 3M1860, 3M1870, 3M8000 and 3M8210, whereas, for MHA only known FFR model was 3M8210. MHA physically destroyed FFRs thus deemed unsuitable for further evaluation. Both MGS &amp; MHI methods showed acceptable microbiological efficacy and no significant effect on user acceptability, respirator fit and filter efficiency, till 3 cycles of decontamination.\nSummary of characteristics of studies using physical decontamination methods, other than UVGI, for reprocessing of FFRs.\n	Variables of Decontamination Methods	Variables of FFRs	Results	 	Authors (Year)	Mode of Delivery	Temperature	Duration	No. of Deconta-mination Cycle	Total no. of Models used	Part of FFR exposed	Replicates	Parameters Assessed	Summary of Results	 	DRY HEAT	 	Viscusi et al (2009)	Microwave	-	2 m	1	9	Intact	3	Physical Changes	Observable physical changes on many models of FFRs	 	(1 m each side)	(6 N95	 	Filter Efficiency	Expected levels of Filter Aerosol penetration (&lt;5%) &amp;

Dry heat. Dry heat for reprocessing of FFRs has been evaluated in 4 studies wherein microwave (MGI), Hot Air Oven (DHO) and Electric Rice Cooker (TERC) have been used. 3M8210 was the only known N95-FFR model which underwent reprocessing by any dry heat delivering method. Various parameters which have been evaluated against them are shown in Fig 2 and their exposure variables and results are summarized in Table 2. In MGI method, respirator models were destroyed in both studies. FFRs reprocessed by DHO were able to physically withstand temperatures at 80 C without affecting durability and filter efficiency. Electric rice cooker (TERC) was able to provide 99-100% biocidal efficacy against Bacillus subtilis spores.\nB. Gaseous chemical methods\nOnly 4 studies, prior to 2020, had evaluated a gaseous disinfection method for reprocessing of N95-FFRs. The methods used were Ethylene Oxide (EO), Hydrogen peroxide in a Plasma Sterilizer (HPGP) and Hydrogen Peroxide in vaporized form by using a commercial automated vapor generator. FFR models were not disclosed in any of the studies. Parameters against which they were evaluated; and their exposure variables and findings of the studies are provided in Fig 2 and Table 3, respectively. After EO sterilization, FFRs didn't showed any physical changes, or had offensive odor, and filter efficiency was also not degraded significantly even after undergoing 3 cycles. In 3 studies, where HPGP was evaluated, no significant physical changes on the FFRs were noted but filter efficiency of 25% (9/36) respirators was noted to be degraded in one of three studies. However, similar effect was not noted when FFRs were treated with vaporized form.\nSummary of characteristics of studies using gaseous chemical methods for reprocessing of FFRs.\nAuthors	Variables of Decontamination Methods	Variables of FFRs	Results	 	Disinfectant Sterilizer	Packaging Conditions	Duration	No. of Decontamination Cycles	Total no. of Models used	Part of FFR exposed	Replicates	Parameters Assessed	Summary of Results	 	Bergman et al (2010)	Ethylene Oxide	Kept in Tyvek  pouches	1 hr exposure	3	6	Intact	3	Physical Changes	Partial separation of inner foam cushion of 1 FFR model	 	Amsco  Eagle  3017	 	12 hr aeration	 	Odor	No comment on odor	 	6 FFR per pouch	 	Filter Efficiency	Expected levels of filter aerosol penetration (&lt;5%) &amp; filter airflow resistance	 	Viscusi et al (2009)	Ethylene Oxide	Individual poly/paper pouch	1 hr exposure	1	9	Intact	3	Physical Changes	No observable physical changes on FFRs	 	3 M Steri-Vac 5XL	(6 N95	 	4 hr aeration	 	3 P100)	 	Filter Efficiency	Expected levels of filter aerosol penetration (&lt;5%) &amp; filter airflow resistance	 	Viscusi et al (2007)	Ethylene Oxide	Individual poly/paper pouch	1 hr exposure	1	2	Intact	4	Physical Changes	Straps of P100 FFRs were slightly darkened	 	3 M Steri-Vac 4XL &amp; 5 XL	 	Filter Efficiency	Average penetration increased for both respirator types but were within NIOSH certification criteria	 	4 hr aeration	 	Salter et al (2010)	Ethylene Oxide	Individual sterilization pouch	3 hr exposure	1	6	Intact	3	Presence of Toxic Chemical Residues	EO was not detected on any of the model	 	Amsco  Eagle  3017	12 hr aeration	 	Treated EO contained Diacetone alcohol and a possible mutagen and carcinogen, 2-hydroxyethyl acetate (HEA)	 	Bergman et al (2010)	H2O2 Gas Plasma (HPGP)	Mylar/Tyvek  pouch	55 m cycle time	3	6	Intact	3	Physical Changes	No physical changes on FFRs	 	Odor	No comment on odor	 	STERRAD  100S	6 samples per pouch	Filter Efficiency	25% (9/36) samples had aerosol penetration &gt;5% suggestive of degradation in filter efficiency	 	Viscusi et al (2009)	H2O2 Gas Plasma (HPGP)	Mylar/Tyvek  pouch	55 m cycle time	1	9	Intact	3	Physical Changes	Metallic nose bands not as shiny as unexposed controls	 	(6 N95	Filter Efficiency	Expected levels of Filter Aerosol penetration (&lt;5%) &amp; filter airflow resistance	 	STERRAD  100S	6 samples per pouch	3 P100)	 	Viscusi et al (2007)	H2O2 Gas Plasma (HPGP)	Mylar/Tyvek  pouch		1	2	Intact	4	Physical Changes	Aluminium nosebands slightly tarnished with both cycles	 	Filter Efficiency	Average penetration not significantly increased &amp; remained within limit of NIOSH certification criteria for both respirator types and cycling conditions	 	STERRAD  100S	55 m	 	STERRAD  NX	100 m	 	Salter et al (2010)	H2O2 Gas Plasma (HPGP)	Sterilization pouches	55 m	1	6	Intact	3	Presence of Toxic Chemical Residues	No residues on FFRs	 	Sterilization cycle aborted when &gt;6 FFRs were loaded in the sterilization chamber	 	STERRAD  100S	 	Bergman et al (2010)	H2O2 Vapor (HPV)		15 m dwell	3	6	Intact	3	Physical Changes	No physical changes on FFRs	 	Odor	No comment on odor	 	125 m total cycle time	Filter Efficiency	Expected levels of filter aerosol penetration (&lt;5%) &amp; filter airflow resistance	 	Clarus  R HPV Generator	 	\nABBREVIATIONS: FFR: Filtering Facepiece Respirator, hr: Hour, m: Minute, H2O2: Hydrogen Peroxide\nC. Liquid chemical methods\nSix different liquid decontamination methods have been evaluated on N95-FFRs in 8 studies. These are Bleach, Liquid Hydrogen Peroxide (LHP), Alcohols including Ethanol and Isopropyl Alcohol, Mixed oxidants, Dimethyl Dioxirane and Soap solution. Parameters against which they were evaluated, their exposure variables and results of the studies are provided in Fig 2 and Table 4, respectively. Against Bleach, only known N95-FFR models evaluated were 3M8210 and Wilson SAF-T-FIT Plus (S4 Table). 3M8210 was the only known N95-FFR which was evaluated for Alcohols.\nSummary of characteristics of studies using liquid &amp;

Miscellaneous methods\nIn one study, commercial wipes of 0.9% Sodium Hypochlorite, Benzalkonium Chloride and an Inert material were evaluated for changes in filter efficiency and microbicidal efficacy by applying them on surface of N95-FFRs, as shown in Fig 2 &amp; Table 4.\nDiscussion\nAn Influenza pandemic was always on the horizon and in 2009, it became reality. Researchers at NIOSH have been looking actively for finding a suitable method for reprocessing of FFRs since 2006 after the report of IOM Committee to tackle global shortage of FFRs. Consequently, search for a suitable reprocessing method began under NIOSH. During 2007-2012, 12 studies were published which evaluated reprocessing methods for FFRs, most of them were conducted by or in collaboration with NIOSH. In contrast, between 2013-2019, only 5 published studies had evaluated a reprocessing technique for N95-FFRs, with last study published by NIOSH in 2015. Ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has brutally exposed the stalled progress in research to address this issue.\nIt has been shown that the surface stability of SARS-CoV-2 on various surfaces lasts up to 3 days but this study didn't include porous surfaces like that of respirators. However, a study recently, showed it to be present on outer layer of surgical masks on day 7. This recent data makes it imperative to decontaminate FFRs in between use as the risk of contact transmission without decontamination is considerable. Previously, CDC also discouraged reusing N95-FFRs whenever risk of contact transmission of a pathogen was high. Furthermore, it is in larger global interest to find a suitable reprocessing method for N95-FFRs as they are not used frequently by HCWs in low to middle income countries (LMICs) while tackling airborne pathogens, such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis, against which their use is mandatory. Finding a reprocessing method for FFRs will lead to provision of adequate respiratory protection for HCWs in such resource limited settings.\nWe found that UVGI was the most frequently evaluated reprocessing method for N95-FFRs, as shown in Fig 2 and Table 3. Reprocessing by UVGI method maintained the overall physical structure and filter efficiency of the FFRs and was able to demonstrate sufficient microbicidal efficacy. Furthermore, it had insignificant influence on the respirator fit and reprocessed FFRs were devoid of any toxic residues but studies which evaluated these parameters were few. Furthermore, these findings should be assessed in view of varying exposure variables of UV dose used in these studies and the methodological variations in estimating the measures of microbicidal efficacy, as shown in Table 1.\nDose of irradiation is the most important variable for determining microbiological efficacy of UVGI method which, in turn, is determined by irradiance at the surface of FFR and duration of exposure. All studies, except one, which evaluated the microbicidal efficacy of UVGI used enveloped viruses as the challenge micro-organism. Total doses around 1-2 J/cm2 have shown to provide &gt;=4 log10 reduction of viruses inoculated on FFRs. Lin et al used Bacillus subtilis spores as challenge micro-organisms and found that from a 18.9mW/cm2 UV-C source, exposure for 5 min (corresponding to a dose of 5-6 J/cm2) was able to kill all spores. However, this study measured relative survival of spores (in percentage) on exposed respirator coupons as compared to control coupons (unexposed) instead of log reduction of spores. Whether such doses will be effective against other airborne pathogens, such as M. tuberculosis should be assessed in future research. Furthermore, a study by Fisher et al concluded that the UV-C dose required for microbicidal efficacy is a function of the dose available to the electret medium rather than total dose, which in turn, is dependent on the penetrance (transmittance) of the layer above it. Hence, effective doses of UV-C for microbicidal efficacy will be model specific and needs to be established accordingly. We conclude that UVGI has great potential to be utilized as an effective decontamination method for N95-FFRs during this time of crisis however, more studies are needed to validate the various variables associated with the delivery of the UVGI method and respirator model specific doses will need to be established.\nMGS &amp; MHI methods delivered moist heat to FFRs in a microwave and a bench top laboratory incubator, respectively and have shown no significant effect on user acceptability, respirator fit and filter efficiency till 3 cycles of decontamination. However, multiple studies evaluating physical changes noticed partial separation of inner foam nose cushion in both methods for a particular FFR model (3M1870), where model identity was disclosed, but effect was not pronounced after undergoing multiple cycles of decontamination. Whether it is a model specific issue or not should be evaluated in future studies. In terms of microbicidal efficacy, &gt;=4 log10 reduction of enveloped viruses was demonstrated for both methods. We are of opinion that these methods are low cost, easily doable in any setting, but require more validation in terms of other respirator models and cycles of decontamination, in future studies. MGS method is particularly suitable for implementation by individuals at home and smaller healthcare settings. Sparking due to placing metallic components in microwave has been a concern but it has not been noticed in MGS method.\nFew studies were done on Dry heat as a modality to reprocess FFRs. Physical degradation of the respirators was noted, in varying degree, with these methods using Microwave (MGI), Hot air oven (DHO) and traditional electric rice cooker (TERC). Of these, TERC has shown to be microbiologically efficacious against B. subtilis spores and preserve physical architecture and filter efficiency of the respirators in limited studies conducted using it We opine that the literature is insufficient to either recommend or refute dry heat as a method of reprocessing for FFRs.\nEthylene oxide (EO) and Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) are ideally suited for reprocessing of temperature sensitive articles hence, their use for reprocessing N95-FFRs is particularly promising. They have been evaluated as a reprocessing method for N95-FFRs simultaneously in 4 studies in which, FFRs were exposed to EO and H2O2 (HPGP) in their respective sterilizers for standard cycling conditions, as described in Table 3. In addition, Viscusi et al evaluated vaporized H2O2 (HPV) generated in a commercial, automated vapor generator (BIOQUELL ). FFR models were not disclosed in any of these studies. The studies found that EO performed suitably in maintaining the physical architecture and filtration efficiency of the respirators however microbicidal efficacy, user acceptability and effect of respirator fit on N-95 FFRs were not evaluated in any study. Furthermore, a study by Salter et al found possible carcinogen and mutagen, 2-hydroxyethyl acetate (HEA) on FFRs which had undergone EO sterilization. Hence, this method cannot be recommended for reprocessing of N95-FFRs due to safety concerns and improving the safety profile of EO by increasing aeration duration post-sterilization can be explored in future studies.\nHydrogen peroxide provides microbicidal activity by way of generating free radicals and its degradation products are safe. In 3 studies, where HPGP was evaluated, no significant physical changes on the FFRs were noted but one study noted degradation in filter efficiency of 25% (9/36) respirators. However, this effect was not noted when FFRs were treated with vaporized form. In a commercial evaluation done for FDA by Batelle Institute on Clarus C HPV generator (BIOQUELL ) in 2016, no filter degradation was noted on 3M1870 FFR even after undergoing 50 cycles of decontamination. This system has been granted emergency use authorization (EUA) by FDA, after COVID-19 pandemic, for reprocessing N95-FFRs. Concerns have been raised regarding throughput of HPGP as in a study authors noticed cycles were aborted in STERRAD  Sterilizer whenever &gt;6 FFRs were placed. This could be due to presence of cellulose in the straps of the respirators leading to absorption of H2O2. Prior to 2020, no study, in published literature, had evaluated microbicidal efficacy of H2O2 on FFRs, but recently, Fisher et al found it effective in removing SARS-CoV-2 from N95-FFRs. Furthermore, Batelle report, also showed 6 log reduction of Geobacillus stearothermophilus spores on FFRs which underwent reprocessing by HPV. Overall, Hydrogen peroxide in gaseous form is a suitable option for reprocessing N95-FFRs but it needs to be evaluated rigorously for other parameters such as respirator fit and also against other N95-FFR models. However, at present its availability is restricted to limited resource rich settings.\nSubmersion of FFRs in liquid disinfectants is a simple method of decontaminating them. Bleach was the most frequently evaluated liquid disinfectant for reprocessing of FFRs, being evaluated in 9 studies of which, 1 used disinfectant wipes. Exposure to bleach caused physical changes in the FFRs in terms of being stiff, mottled and tarnishing of metallic nosepiece. Offensive odor from FFRs was noticed in most studies. Furthermore, chlorine release has been noted when respirators were exposed to moisture, raising concerns regarding the safety of this method if a person breathes through it. Though it has been found to have no significant degradation in the filter quality of the FFRs and have excellent microbicidal efficacy, FFRs decontaminated by bleach are not safe.\nLiquid Hydrogen peroxide (LHP) in 3% concentration was able to preserve filter efficiency &amp; physical architecture of the N95-FFRs and was devoid of any toxic residues post-exposure. Alcohols (Ethanol and Isopropyl alcohol) have also been evaluated in 3 studies, but they are known to significantly degrade the filter efficiency due to removal of electrostatic charges from the electret media. Similarly, soap &amp; water degraded the filter efficiency, as noted in a study.\nWe found that UVGI was the most widely evaluated reprocessing method, being evaluated for 23 different known FFR models. Nine known FFR models preserved their filter efficiency and 18 known FFR models achieved adequate microbicidal efficacy after undergoing reprocessing by UVGI method. However, the same FFR model: Parameter combination for UVGI was not evaluated in more than two studies. Six known FFR models were reprocessed by MGS &amp; MHI methods. Except for 3M1870, as discussed previously, none of the FFRs showed physical changes after undergoing reprocessing. In none of the studies which evaluated Gaseous chemical methods, identity of FFR models was disclosed. Thus, we suggest that future studies should include multiple known FFR models while evaluating a reprocessing method as compatibility of the FFR with the reprocessing method is of paramount importance.\nA summary assessment of the body of literature, published prior to 2020, on reprocessing of N95-FFRs has been provided in Fig 2. However, the findings of this systematic review and opinion of the authors should be assessed in light of limited literature available on this topic, prior to 2020. Furthermore, readers should also consider the variability in exposure variables of the reprocessing methods and methodological variabilities in the evaluated parameters within and between reprocessing methods. For example, to evaluate microbicidal efficacy, studies have used different categories of micro-organisms and growth parameters accordingly while few included additional soiling challenges to mimic micro-organisms in human secretions. Some parameters were evaluated only in few studies such as odor, wear comfort, and donning ease were evaluated objectively only in 1 study, respirator fit in 2 studies and chemical safety in 1 study. Hence, changes in these parameters which are not studied much, nevertheless are important, should be the focus of future studies. We didn't do a meta-analysis as the number of studies done to evaluate a particular parameter for a reprocessing method were few and heterogeneous in terms of both exposure &amp; methodological variables.\nAs we write this review, a large body of literature on reprocessing of N95-FFRs has been already published, but when we did literature search, only few studies were published and majority were in preprint, non-peer reviewed versions. Hence, in this systematic review, we only included studies which were published prior to COVID pandemic. This review may help administrators, infectious disease specialists and infection control personnel to formulate policies for effective utilization of single use, N95-FFRs to prevent respiratory transmission of SARS-CoV-2 as well as other airborne pathogens. It will help researchers to find existing knowledge gaps in respirator reprocessing techniques and help them to design future studies. Furthermore, manufacturers may find it useful by knowing existing limitations and work their way around by developing new respirator material or design, more amenable to commonly available reprocessing techniques.\nConclusions\nWe found that published literature on evaluation of reprocessing methods of FFRs was scant, prior to COVID pandemic. Physical methods of decontamination, such as using heat or radiation, were the most commonly evaluated methods for reprocessing of FFRs. Majority of studies evaluated either physical changes or effect on filter efficiency of respirators after undergoing decontamination and the microbicidal efficacy of the decontamination method. Only few studies evaluated the effect of decontamination methods on respirator fit or their chemical safety profile. We found that there was a lot of heterogeneity amongst the studies regarding the exposure variables of UVGI method, used respirator models and methodology to evaluate microbicidal efficacy in terms of challenge micro-organisms, method of exposure of challenge micro-organism to FFRs, use of a soiling challenge and evaluated parameters.\nWe found that UVGI was the most commonly evaluated method in the published literature, prior to 2020 and it ticks all the boxes required for an ideal reprocessing method for N-95 FFRs. However, doses of UV-C irradiation which can achieve satisfactory microbicidal efficacy needs to be determined specifically for each FFR model. Majority of heat-based methods caused physical changes in the respirators, in varying degree, but adequately removed viral micro-organisms from the surface of FFRs without compromising filter efficiency, even after undergoing multiple cycles of decontamination. In particular, MGS method had extremely short cycle time &amp; seems easy to implement in any setting. Few studies evaluated gaseous chemical methods such as EO and Hydrogen peroxide &amp; found that filter efficiency of FFRs was maintained. However, safety concerns were raised on reusing FFRs which underwent reprocessing by EO, in the only study evaluating it.\nTo summarize, reusing N95-FFRs is need of the hour due to COVID-19 pandemic. Choosing a reprocessing method for FFR decontamination requires careful considerations of various factors such as physical changes, respirator fit, filter efficiency and chemical safety profile, besides being microbiologically efficacious. Furthermore, compatibility of reprocessing method with the FFR models used in a setting, duration of reprocessing cycle and costs involved make it an extremely complex decision for the infection control personnel and administrators. Presently, promising technologies which need to be evaluated rigorously include UVGI, HP, MGS &amp; MHI. Though, emergency use approvals have been given to Hydrogen Peroxide STERRAD  Gas Plasma Sterilizer and BIOQUELL  Clarus C HPV generator, their presence is extremely limited worldwide, particularly in LMICs. Finding a suitable reprocessing method for N95-FFRs is also important from the perspective of infection control against airborne pathogens in LMICs, such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis. MGS and MHI have shown to be efficacious against enveloped viruses and not compromise the filter efficiency up to 3 cycles of decontamination, in multiple studies. Of them, MGS has an extremely short cycle and should be considered for emergency implementation in resource limited settings.\nSupporting information\nReferences\nWHO.

(Please upload your review as an attachment if it exceeds 20,000 characters)\nReviewer #1: Thank you for the opportunity to review this manuscript. The authors have performed an extensive literature search and review on N95 make re-processing. The topic is pertinent in the current setting, although rapidly changing. The authors have mostly stuck to peer-reviewed content, which is not always the case for studies at this time, but is beneficial to their work. The manuscript is very comprehensive, perhaps a little too much for a topic that they comment on as inadequate and sparse.\nMy concerns are:\n  The comments &quot;full set of personal protective equipment (PPE) including gowns, gloves, facemasks, face-shields or goggles and respirators for their protection during patient care&quot; and &quot;HCWs need to be protected against bioaerosols at all costs, which at minimum, is offered by use of N95 Filtering Facepiece Respirator (N95-FFR)&quot; are misleading. In fact, citation (4) by the authors states that N95s are only needed during aerosol generating procedures. The authors should clarify this in the introduction.\n  &quot;removes &gt; 95% particles of around 300 nm&quot; - there is an official definition of what an N95 filters, the authors should use that\n  The statement &quot;No independent study prior to 2020 has evaluated microbicidal efficacy of H2O2 on FFRs&quot; is not correct, see Fischer et. al 2020, among others\n  The discussion is far too long, essentially putting the tables into text. As such:\n  Paragraph 1 of the discussion is off topic and tangential opinion, it should be removed\n  The paragraph that starts &quot;A typical N95-FFR consists of facepiece...&quot; was not material analysed by the literature search and should be removed\n  The statement &quot;N95-FFRs are difficult to decontaminate owing to the porous nature of the main body and electrostatically charged nature of electret media&quot; needs a reference, this is debatable\n  The discussion needs to be reduced to key points and synthesis, with a cohesive analysis of the literature. At least two pages could be removed.\n  The conclusion doesn't provide any conclusion regarding the review, but comments on the need for the review and then, again, summarizes the general concepts. There is no analysis here. There is also a dichotomy here, with one sentence stating a need for solution for low income countries (which I agree with), to the very next sentence stating an urgent need to study UV and HPV (not low income country solutions, by the authors own admission).\n  My biggest concern here is that this really isn't a systematic review. It attempts to be, and provides the needed supplementary info (i.e. PRISMA diagram) but doesn't provide any significant analysis. This is really a narrative review with an extensive literature search.\nMinor\n  The virus name is actually &quot;SARS-CoV-2&quot; not &quot;SARS-COV-2&quot;\n  Figure 2 legend &quot;plotted against the reprocessing method&quot; - not sure what the authors mean, it is a table, nothing is &quot;plotted&quot;\n**********\n6.

In fact, citation (4) by the authors states that N95s are only needed during aerosol generating procedures. The authors should clarify this in the introduction.\nAuthor's Reply: The authors have suitably modified the sentence as suggested by the reviewers in the Introduction section (Page 4, Paragraph 1).\nComment 2: Section: Introduction\nremoves &gt; 95% particles of around 300 nm&quot; - there is an official definition of what an N95 filters, the authors should use that\nAuthor's Reply: The authors have modified the sentence and provided the reference of the official definition (Reference 7). In previously submitted manuscript, reference 5 &amp; 7 were duplicated, now the new reference is given in place of Reference 7 (Page 4, Paragraph 1).\nComment 3: Section: Discussion\nThe statement &quot;No independent study prior to 2020 has evaluated microbicidal efficacy of H2O2 on FFRs&quot; is not correct, see Fischer et. al 2020, among others.\nAuthor's Reply: Fischer et al (2020) have referenced Batelle report which evaluated microbicidal efficacy of Hydrogen peroxide for decontamination of N95-FFRs. It was a third party &quot;commercial&quot; evaluation of Clarus C Hydrogen Peroxide vapor generator done by Batelle Institute on behalf of FDA. This wasn't an independent study published in scientific domain. Hence, we are of the opinion that the statement is correct. Furthermore, we have referenced findings of Batelle report in the Discussion section of the manuscript, where deemed suitable (Page 42, Paragraph 1).\nComment 4: Section: Discussion\nThe discussion is far too long, essentially putting the tables into text. As such:\ni. Paragraph 1 of the discussion is off topic and tangential opinion, it should be removed\nAuthor's Reply: In our opinion, this paragraph is important as it highlights the chronology of the scientific progress made in finding a suitable reprocessing method for enabling reuse of FFRs. We humbly opine that had such a method been found in the previous decade, the crises of FFRs wouldn't have been of this humongous proportions during COVID-19 pandemic. In late to 2000s to late 2010s, there was scientific thrust in finding such a reprocessing method which got derailed in the mid to late 2010s contributing partly to the current crises of shortage of FFRs. \nii. The paragraph that starts &quot;A typical N95-FFR consists of facepiece...&quot; was not material analysed by the literature search and should be removed.\nAuthor's Reply: The paragraph has been removed as suggested by the reviewers (Omitted).\niii. The statement &quot;N95-FFRs are difficult to decontaminate owing to the porous nature of the main body and electrostatically charged nature of electret media&quot; needs a reference, this is debatable\nAuthor's Reply: The statement &amp; paragraph containing it has been removed in the revised Discussion (Omitted).\niv. The discussion needs to be reduced to key points and synthesis, with a cohesive analysis of the literature. At least two pages could be removed.\nAuthor's Reply: Discussion has been extensively modified as suggested by the reviewers. \nComment 5: Section: Conclusion\nThe conclusion doesn't provide any conclusion regarding the review, but comments on the need for the review and then, again, summarizes the general concepts. There is no analysis here. There is also a dichotomy here, with one sentence stating a need for solution for low income countries (which I agree with), to the very next sentence stating an urgent need to study UV and HPV (not low income country solutions, by the authors own admission).\nAuthor's Reply: The conclusions are now modified, hopefully to the reviewer's satisfaction. The first 2 paragraphs summarize the findings of the study whereas the last paragraph gives general concepts and way for the future (Pages 45-46).\nComment 6: Section: \nMy biggest concern here is that this really isn't a systematic review. It attempts to be, and provides the needed supplementary info (i.e. PRISMA diagram) but doesn't provide any significant analysis. This is really a narrative review with an extensive literature search.\nAuthor's Reply: We wholeheartedly accept the criticism of the reviewer. However, we will like to counter on the following points:\n1. Systematic reviews address a specific research question using explicit methodology of collecting, selecting and appraising studies and synthesizing the results qualitatively or quantitatively, as appropriate. \n2. Our review appears as a narrative review because it addresses a broad research question and the outcome of the included studies is discussed more in &quot;Qualitative terms&quot; rather than quantitatively.\n3. We are of the opinion that the included studies varied extensively in terms of heterogeneity hence discussion in quantitative terms will not do justice to the essence of the article. Hence, qualitative results of included studies were taken into account in discussion and Quantitative details are provided in the Tables.\n4. Overall the studies have not shown conflicting results between themselves for a particular reprocessing method despite being extremely heterogeneous. Hence the findings appear as General concepts, when in fact they are qualitative synthesis of the published literature on the topic. Wherever, conflicting results for a particular reprocessing method have been observed amongst studies, we have made an attempt to discuss.\n5. Hence, as suggested by the reviewer, we have revised the Discussion &amp; Conclusion sections extensively focusing now more on the qualitative findings pertaining to the review, hopefully to the reviewer's satisfaction.\nMinor\nComment 7: \nThe virus name is actually &quot;SARS-CoV-2&quot; not &quot;SARS-COV-2&quot;\nAuthor's Reply: This has been corrected in all the relevant places\nComment 8: \nFigure 2 legend &quot;plotted against the reprocessing method&quot; - not sure what the authors mean, it is a table, nothing is &quot;plotted&quot;\nAuthor's Reply: The legend has been suitably modified\n10.1371/journal.pone.0242474.r003\nDecision Letter 1\nMukherjee\nAmitava\nThis is an open access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited.\n 27 Oct 2020 \nPONE-D-20-23922R1\nExploring options for reprocessing of N95 Filtering Facepiece Respirators (N95-FFRs) amidst COVID-19 pandemic: A systematic review\nPLOS ONE\nDear Dr. Gupta,\nThank you for submitting your manuscript to PLOS ONE.

Here is our point by point rebuttal to the suggestions/ concerns raised by the Reviewer:\nCOMMENT 1: SECTION: TITLE\nPlease check the term &quot;systematic&quot; in the title, and consider whether it may be changed to &quot;Narrative review.\nAuthor's Reply: In our humble opinion, a &quot;Systematic review&quot; differs from a &quot;Narrative review&quot; in the following points:\na. The research question is well defined.\nb. There is clearly defined criteria for selection for articles published in literature\nc. Methods of extraction of and synthesis of data are explicit\nd. The critical appraisal of the quality of included studies is explicitly done\nIn summary, systematic reviews differ from narrative reviews in their &quot;Methodology&quot; rather than the &quot;Results&quot;. We are of the opinion that our review ticks all the boxes in this regard. Furthermore the protocol of the article is also registered with the International prospective register of systematic reviews (PROSPERO) beforehand. \nWe have already explained that the results of our article are synthesized and discussed more in the qualitative terms rather than quantitative terms due to the heterogeneity in the methodologies of various articles who have researched this topic. Hence, we humbly request that we should persist with the word &quot;Systematic&quot; in the title.\nCOMMENT 2: SECTION: DISCUSSION\nThe authors must have the wrong Fischer et al. (2020)- I am referring to 1. Fischer R.J., (2020) Effectiveness of N95 Respirator Decontamination and Reuse against SARS-CoV-2 Virus. Emerging Infect Dis 10.3201/eid2609.201524. This article doesn't reference any other article , but does the experiments themselves. This is but one example. It is actually very important to the manuscript, as this is now the most common method for commercial decontamination. \nAuthor's Reply: We had cited the same study which the reviewer is referring to but it was a preprint version which we cited (Reference 43). Our statement in previous rebuttal &quot;Fischer et al (2020) have referenced Batelle report which evaluated microbicidal efficacy of Hydrogen peroxide for decontamination of N95-FFRs&quot;was based on this pre-print version but their comment about Batelle report are now removed from the final print when this article is published as &quot;Letter&quot; in Emerging Infectious Disease, which the reviewer is referring to, hence the confusion. Thus, we have now modified the reference of this article (No. 43) in our manuscript to final print version from the originally given pre-print version.\nIn the first cycle of peer review, the reviewer had commented &quot;The statement- No independent study prior to 2020 has evaluated microbicidal efficacy of H2O2 on FFRs - is not correct, see Fischer et al 2020, among others.&quot; We modified it in our article as &quot;Prior to 2020, no study, in published literature, had evaluated microbicidal efficacy of H2O2 on FFRs, but recently, Fisher et al[43] found it effective in removing SARS-CoV-2 from N95-FFRs&quot;. Our statement in the manuscript is correct probably the phrase &quot;Prior to 2020&quot; is ignored. This study by Fischer et al is published online in June 2020 (preprint version) &amp; final version in September 2020. They evaluated the efficacy of VHP (Vaporized Hydrogen Peroxide) on N95 respirators contaminated with SARS-CoV-2 virus, a virus which was non-existent prior to 2020, so how can our statement be deemed as incorrect as we are specifically talking about research done Prior to 2020.\nFurthermore, it is said that such inaccuracies are an example. We humbly request the reviewer to provide specific statements which are inaccurate and require correction.\nComment 3: Section: Discussion\nThe discussion is still too long and re-states the results. I encourage the authors to think of how to discuss the results, not re-state them. \nAuthor's Reply: We humbly request the reviewer's criticism in terms of 2 things: length of discussion and re-stating the results in discussion, but kindly consider this:\na. The discussion appears lengthy because there are multiple methods which have been evaluated in the published literature for reprocessing of FFRs. We believe that all these methods needs to be discussed individually in terms of their variables, pros, and cons so that their suitability in reprocessing of FFRs in a particular setting can be assessed.\nb. Regarding, the re-stating of results in discussion section, we believe that some form of re-stating of the result is required to initiate discussion of a particular issue. \nHence, taking the criticism in our stride, we have once again attempted to reduce the length of the discussion, hopefully to the reviewer's satisfaction. Overall word count of our manuscript text (without abstract, tables/ figures and their legends, references) is 4633, which in our opinion is usual for such articles. \nDr. Ayush Gupta\nAssistant Professor\nDepartment of Microbiology\nAIIMS Bhopal\n10.1371/journal.pone.0242474.r005\nDecision Letter 2\nMukherjee\nAmitava\nThis is an open access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited.\n 4 Nov 2020 \nExploring options for reprocessing of N95 Filtering Facepiece Respirators (N95-FFRs) amidst COVID-19 pandemic: A systematic review\nPONE-D-20-23922R2\nDear Dr. Gupta,\nWe're pleased to inform you that your manuscript has been judged scientifically suitable for publication and will be formally accepted for publication once it meets all outstanding technical requirements.\nWithin one week, you'll receive an e-mail detailing the required amendments.

Integrity","abstract":"The ability to disinfect and reuse disposable N95 filtering facepiece respirators (FFRs) may be needed during a pandemic of an infectious respiratory disease such as influenza.\n Ultraviolet germicidal irradiation (UVGI) is one possible method for respirator disinfection.\n However, UV radiation degrades polymers, which presents the possibility that UVGI exposure could degrade the ability of a disposable respirator to protect the worker.\n To study this, we exposed both sides of material coupons and respirator straps from four models of N95 FFRs to UVGI doses from 120–950 J/cm2.\n We then tested the particle penetration, flow resistance, and bursting strengths of the individual respirator coupon layers, and the breaking strength of the respirator straps.\n We found that UVGI exposure led to a small increase in particle penetration (up to 1.25%) and had little effect on the flow resistance.\n UVGI exposure had a more pronounced effect on the strengths of the respirator materials.\n At the higher UVGI doses, the strength of the layers of respirator material was substantially reduced (in some cases, by &gt;90%).\n The changes in the strengths of the respirator materials varied considerably among the different models of respirators.\n UVGI had less of an effect on the respirator straps; a dose of 2360 J/cm2 reduced the breaking strength of the straps by 20–51%.\n Our results suggest that UVGI could be used to effectively disinfect disposable respirators for reuse, but the maximum number of disinfection cycles will be limited by the respirator model and the UVGI dose required to inactivate the pathogen.\n","id":"PMC4699414","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Taylor &amp; Francis","authors":[{"firstname":"William

set standards in the reporting of systematic reviews and meta-analyses.\n\n Our aim was to evaluate the impact of PRISMA endorsement on the quality of reporting and methodological quality of systematic reviews and meta-analyses, published in journals in the field of gastroenterology and hepatology (GH).\n\n\nMethods\nQuality of reporting and methodological quality were evaluated by assessing the adherence of papers to PRISMA checklist and AMSTAR quality scale.\n\n After identifying the GH journals which endorsed PRISMA in instructions for authors (IA), we appraised: 15 papers published in 2012 explicitly mentioning PRISMA in the full text (Group A); 15 papers from the same journals published in 2012 not explicitly mentioning PRISMA in the full text (Group B); 30 papers published the year preceding PRISMA endorsement from the same journals as above (Group C); 30 papers published in 2012 on the 10 highest impact factor journals in GH which not endorsed PRISMA (Group D).\n\n\nResults\nPRISMA statement was referred in the IA in 9 out of 70 GH journals (12.9%).\n\n We found significant increase in overall adherence to PRISMA checklist (Group A, 90.1%; Group C, 83.1%; p?=?0.003) and compliance to AMSTAR scale (Group A, 85.0%; Group C, 74.6%; p?=?0.002), following the PRISMA endorsement from the nine GH journals.\n\n Explicit referencing of PRISMA in

compliance with AMSTAR were significantly higher in journals endorsing PRISMA compared to those not (Groups A+B vs.\n\n D; p?=?0.003 and p?=?0.016, respectively).\n\n\nConclusion\nThe endorsement of PRISMA resulted in increase of both quality of reporting and methodological quality.\n\n It is advised that an increasing number of medical journals include PRISMA in the instructions for

and meta-analyses published in nursing journals: a cross-sectional study","abstract":"Objective\nSystematic reviews (SRs) often poorly report key information, thereby diminishing their usefulness.\n\n Previous studies evaluated published SRs and determined that they failed to meet explicit criteria or characteristics.\n\n The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement was recommended as a reporting guideline for SR and meta-analysis (MA), but previous studies showed that adherence to the statement was not high for SRs published in different medical fields.\n\n Thus, the aims of this study are twofold: (1) to investigate the number of nursing journals that have required or recommended the use of the PRISMA statement for reporting SR, and (2) to examine the adherence of SRs and/or meta-analyses to the PRISMA statement published in nursing journals.\n\n\nDesign\nA cross-sectional study.\n\n\nMethods\nNursing journals listed in the ISI journal citation report were divided into 2 groups based on the recommendation of PRISMA statement in their ‘Instruction for Authors’.\n\n SRs and meta-analyses published in 2014 were searched in 3 databases.\n\n 37 SRs and meta-analyses were randomly selected in each group.\n\n The adherence of each item to the PRISMA was examined and summarised using descriptive statistics.\n\n The quality of the SRs was assessed by Assessing the Methodological Quality of Systematic Reviews.\n\n The differences between the 2 groups were compared using the Mann-Whitney U test.\n\n\nResults\nOut of 107 nursing journals, 30 (28.0%) recommended or required authors to follow the PRISMA statement when they submit SRs or meta-analyses.\n\n The median rates of adherence to the PRISMA statement for reviews published in journals with and without PRISMA endorsement were 64.9% (IQR: 17.6–92.3%) and 73.0% (IQR: 59.5–94.6%), respectively.\n\n No significant difference was observed in any of the items between the 2 groups.\n\n\nConclusions\nThe median adherence of SRs and meta-analyses in nursing journals to PRISMA is low at 64.9% and 73.0%, respectively.\n\n Nonetheless, the adherence level of nursing journals to the PRISMA statement does not significantly vary whether they endorse or recommend such a guideline.\n\n\n","id":"PMC5306529","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"BMJ Publishing

Items of Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses) Statement was published to help authors improve how they report systematic reviews.\n\n It is unknown how many journals mention PRISMA in their instructions to authors, or whether stronger journal language regarding use of PRISMA improves author compliance.\n\n\nMethodology/Principal Findings\nAn Internet-based investigation examined the extent to which 146 leading medical journals have incorporated the PRISMA Statement into their instructions to authors.\n\n Results were analyzed using descriptive statistics.\n\n Also, systematic reviews published in the leading anesthesiology journals and the QUOROM (QUality Of Reporting Of Meta-analyses) Statement were used to explore the hypothesis that indicating compliance with the QUOROM Statement in the manuscript is associated with improved compliance with the reporting guideline.\n\n In a sample of 146 journals publishing systematic reviews, the PRISMA Statement was referred to in the instructions to authors for 27% (40/146) of journals; more often in general and internal medicine journals (7/14; 50%) than in specialty medicine journals (33/132; 25%).\n\n In the second part of the study, 13 systematic reviews published in the leading anesthesiology journals in 2008 were included for appraisal.\n\n Mention of the QUOROM Statement in the manuscript was associated with higher compliance with the QUOROM checklist (P?=?0.022).\n\n\nConclusions/Significance\nMost of the leading medical journals used ambiguous language regarding what was expected of authors.\n\n Further improvement on quality of reporting of systematic reviews may entail journals clearly informing authors of their requirements.\n\n Stronger directions, such as requiring an indication of adherence to a research quality of reporting statement in the manuscript, may improve reporting and utility of systematic reviews.\n\n\n","id":"PMC3217994","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Public

however, there are no approved methods for FFR decontamination.\n An effective method must reduce the microbial threat, maintain the function of the FFR, and present no residual chemical hazard.\n The method should be readily available, inexpensive and easily implemented by healthcare workers and the general public.\n Many of the general decontamination protocols used in healthcare and home settings are unable to address all of the desired qualities of an efficient FFR decontamination protocol.\n The goal of this study is to evaluate the use of two commercially available steam bags, marketed to the public for disinfecting infant feeding equipment, for FFR decontamination.\n The FFRs were decontaminated with microwave generated steam following the manufacturers' instructions then evaluated for water absorption and filtration efficiency for up to three steam exposures.\n Water absorption of the FFR was found to be model specific as FFRs constructed with hydrophilic materials absorbed more water.\n The steam had little effect on FFR performance as filtration efficiency of the treated FFRs remained above 95%.\n The decontamination efficacy of the steam bag was assessed using bacteriophage MS2 as a surrogate for a pathogenic virus.\n The tested steam bags were found to be 99.9% effective for inactivating MS2 on FFRs; however, more research is required to determine the effectiveness against respiratory pathogens.\n","id":"PMC3078131","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Public Library of Science","authors":[{"firstname":"Edward M.","surname":"Fisher","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jessica L.","surname":"Williams","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Ronald E.","surname":"Shaffer","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Tom","surname":"Jefferson","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Tom","surname":"Jefferson","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}],"References depth 2":[{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Reusability of facemasks during an influenza pandemic: facing the flu.","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Proposed guidance on workplace stockpiling of respirators and facemasks for pandemic influenza.","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Development of a test system to apply virus-containing particles to filtering facepiece respirators for the evaluation of decontamination procedures.","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"A Method to Determine the Available UV-C Dose for the Decontamination of Filtering Facepiece Respirators.","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"The effect of soil accumulation on multiple decontamination processing of N95 filtering facepiece respirator coupons using physical methods.","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"A pandemic influenza preparedness study: use of energetic methods to decontaminate filtering facepiece respirators contaminated with H1N1 aerosols and droplets.","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Evaluation of the survivability of MS2 viral aerosols deposited on filtering face piece respirator samples incorporating antimicrobial technologies.","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Evaluation of five decontamination methods for filtering facepiece respirators.","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Effect of decontamination on the filtration efficiency of two filtering facepiece respirator models.","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Development of a test system to evaluate procedures for decontamination of respirators containing viral droplets.","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Analysis of Residual Chemicals on Filtering Facepiece Respirators After Decontamination.","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Evaluation of Multiple (3-Cycle) Decontamination Processing for Filtering Facepiece Respirators.","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Decontamination of filtration media for respiration.

facepiece respirator (FFR) is commonly used to protect individuals from infectious aerosols.\n Health care experts predict a shortage of N95 FFRs if a severe pandemic occurs, and an option that has been suggested for mitigating such an FFR shortage is to decontaminate and reuse the devices.\n Before the effectiveness of this strategy can be established, many parameters affecting respiratory protection must be measured: biocidal efficacy of the decontamination treatment, filtration performance, pressure drop, fit, and toxicity to the end user post treatment.\n This research effort measured the amount of residual chemicals created or deposited on six models of FFRs following treatment by each of 7 simple decontamination technologies.\n Measured amounts of decontaminants retained by the FFRs treated with chemical disinfectants were small enough that exposure to wearers will be below the permissible exposure limit (PEL).\n Toxic by-products were also evaluated, and two suspected toxins were detected after ethylene oxide treatment of FFR rubber straps.\n The results provide encouragement to efforts promoting the evolution of effective strategies for decontamination and reuse of FFRs.\n","id":"PMC7196687","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Taylor &amp;

aerosol particles: Effects of five decontamination methods","abstract":"This study investigates the effects of five decontamination methods on the filter quality (qf) of three commercially available electret masks—N95, Gauze and Spunlace nonwoven masks.\n Newly developed evaluation methods, the overall filter quality (qf,o) and the qf ratio were applied to evaluate the effectiveness of decontamination methods for respirators.\n A scanning mobility particle sizer is utilized to measure the concentration of polydispersed particles with diameter 14.6–594 nm.\n The penetration of particles and pressure drop (?p) through the mask are used to determine qf and qf,o.\n Experimental results reveal that the most penetrating particle size (MPS) for the pre-decontaminated N95, Gauze and Spunlace masks were 118 nm, 461 nm and 279 nm, respectively, and the respective penetration rates were 2.6%, 23.2% and 70.0%.\n The ?p through the pretreated N95 masks was 9.2 mm H2O at the breathing flow rate of heavy-duty workers, exceeding the ?p values obtained through Gauze and Spunlace masks.\n Decontamination increased the sizes of the most penetrating particles, changing the qf values of all of the masks: qf fell as particle size increased because the penetration increased.\n Bleach increased the ?p of N95, but destroyed the Gauze mask.\n However, the use of an autoclave reduces the ?p values of both the N95 and the Gauze mask.\n Neither the rice cooker nor ethanol altered the ?p of the Gauze mask.\n Chemical decontamination methods reduced the qf,o values for the three electret masks.\n The value of qf,o for PM0.1 exceeded that for PM0.1–0.6, because particles smaller than 100 nm had lower penetration, resulting in a better qf for a given pressure drop.\n The values of qf,o, particularly for PM0.1, reveal that for the tested treatments and masks, physical decontamination methods are less destructive to the filter than chemical methods.\n Nevertheless, when purchasing new or reusing FFRs, penetration should be regarded as the priority.\n","id":"PMC5638397","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Public Library of

consistency and evidence-base of policies and guidelines on the use of mask and respirator to protect hospital health care workers: a global analysis","abstract":"Background\nCurrently there is an ongoing debate and limited evidence on the use of masks and respirators for the prevention of respiratory infections in health care workers (HCWs).\n\n This study aimed to examine available policies and guidelines around the use of masks and respirators in HCWs and to describe areas of consistency between guidelines, as well as gaps in the recommendations, with reference to the WHO and the CDC guidelines.\n\n\nMethods\nPolicies and guidelines related to mask and respirator use for the prevention of influenza, SARS and TB were examined.\n\n Guidelines from the World Health Organization (WHO), the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), three high-income countries and six low/middle-income countries were selected.\n\n\nResults\nUniform recommendations are made by the WHO and the CDC in regards to protecting HCWs against seasonal influenza (a mask for low risk situations and a respirator for high risk situations) and TB (use of a respirator).\n\n However, for pandemic influenza and SARS, the WHO recommends mask use in low risk and respirators in high risk situations, whereas, the CDC recommends respirators in both low and high risk situations.\n\n Amongst the nine countries reviewed, there are variations in the recommendations for all three diseases.\n\n While, some countries align with the WHO recommendations, others align with those made by the CDC.\n\n The choice of respirator and the level of filtering ability vary amongst the guidelines and the different diseases.\n\n Lastly, none of the policies discuss reuse, extended use or the use of cloth masks.\n\n\nConclusion\nCurrently, there are significant variations in the policies and recommendations around mask and respirator use for protection against influenza, SARS and TB.\n\n These differences may reflect the scarcity of level-one evidence available to inform policy development.\n\n The lack of any guidelines on the use of cloth masks, despite widespread use in many low and middle-income countries, remains a policy gap.\n\n Health organizations and countries should jointly evaluate the available evidence, prioritize research to inform evidence gaps, and develop consistent policy on masks and respirator use in the health care setting.\n\n\n","id":"PMC3693993","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"BioMed Central","authors":[{"firstname":"Abrar

filtering facepiece respirators (FFRs) may not be adequate to match demand during a pandemic outbreak.\n One possible strategy to maintain supplies in healthcare settings is to extend FFR use for multiple patient encounters; however, contaminated FFRs may serve as a source for the airborne transmission of virus particles.\n In this study, reaerosolization of virus particles from contaminated FFRs was examined using bacteriophage MS2 as a surrogate for airborne pathogenic viruses.\n MS2 was applied to FFRs as droplets or droplet nuclei.\n A simulated cough (370 l min?1 peak flow) provided reverse airflow through the contaminated FFR.\n The number and size of the reaerosolized particles were measured using gelatin filters and an Andersen Cascade Impactor (ACI).\n Two droplet nuclei challenges produced higher percentages of reaerosolized particles (0.21 and 0.08%) than a droplet challenge (&lt;0.0001%).\n Overall, the ACI-determined size distribution of the reaerosolized particles was larger than the characterized loading virus aerosol.\n This study demonstrates that only a small percentage of viable MS2 viruses was reaerosolized from FFRs by reverse airflow under the conditions evaluated, suggesting that the risks of exposure due to reaerosolization associated with extended use can be considered negligible for most respiratory viruses.\n However, risk assessments should be updated as new viruses emerge and better workplace exposure data becomes available.\n","id":"PMC7537697","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Oxford University

infection control, is a key element in the strategy to end the global TB epidemic.\n\n While effective infection control requires all health system components to function well, this is an area that has not received sufficient attention in South Africa despite the availability of policy and guidelines.\n\n\nAim\nTo describe the state of implementation of TB infection control measures in a high-burden metro in South Africa.\n\n\nSetting\nThe research was undertaken in a high TB- and HIV-burdened metropolitan area of South Africa.\n\n More specifically, the study sites were primary health care facilities (PHC), that among other services also diagnosed TB.\n\n\nMethods\nA cross-sectional survey, focusing on the World Health Organization levels of infection control, which included structured interviews with nurses providing TB diagnosis and treatment services as well as observations, at all 41 PHC facilities in a high TB-burdened and HIV-burdened metro of South Africa.\n\n\nResults\nTuberculosis infection control was poorly implemented, with few facilities scoring 80% and above on compliance with infection control measures.\n\n Facility controls: 26 facilities (63.4%) had an infection control committee and 12 (29.3%) had a written infection control plan.\n\n Administrative controls: 26 facilities (63.4%) reported separating coughing and non-coughing patients, while observations revealed that only 11 facilities (26.8%) had separate waiting areas for (presumptive) TB patients.\n\n Environmental controls: most facilities used open windows for ventilation (n = 30; 73.2%); however, on the day of the visit, only 12 facilities (30.3%) had open windows in consulting rooms.\n\n Personal protective equipment: 9 facilities (22%) did not have any disposable respirators in stock and only 9 respondents (22%) had undergone fit testing.\n\n The most frequently reported barrier to implementing good TB infection control practices was lack of equipment (n = 22; 40%) such as masks and disposable respirators, as well as the structure or layout of the PHC facilities.\n\n The main recommendation to improve TB infection control was education for patients and health care workers (n = 18; 33.3%).\n\n\nConclusion\nAll levels of the health care system should be engaged to address TB prevention and infection control in PHC facilities.\n\n Improved infection control will address the nosocomial spread of TB in health facilities and keep health care workers and patients safe from infection.\n\n\n","id":"PMC6018120","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"AOSIS","authors":[{"firstname":"Michelle

skilled nursing facility in King County, Washington, Public Health–Seattle and King County, aided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, launched a case investigation, contact tracing, quarantine of exposed persons, isolation of confirmed and suspected cases, and on-site enhancement of infection prevention and control.\n\n\nResults\nAs of March 18, a total of 167 confirmed cases of Covid-19 affecting 101 residents, 50 health care personnel, and 16 visitors were found to be epidemiologically linked to the facility.\n\n Most cases among residents included respiratory illness consistent with Covid-19; however, in 7 residents no symptoms were documented.\n\n Hospitalization rates for facility residents, visitors, and staff were 54.5%, 50.0%, and 6.0%, respectively.\n\n The

filter quality (qf) of three commercially available electret masks—N95, Gauze and Spunlace nonwoven masks.\n Newly developed evaluation methods, the overall filter quality (qf,o) and the qf ratio were applied to evaluate the effectiveness of decontamination methods for respirators.\n A scanning mobility particle sizer is utilized to measure the concentration of polydispersed particles with diameter 14.6–594 nm.\n The penetration of particles and pressure drop (?p) through the mask are used to determine qf and qf,o.\n Experimental results reveal that the most penetrating particle size (MPS) for the pre-decontaminated N95, Gauze and Spunlace masks were 118 nm, 461 nm and 279 nm, respectively, and the respective penetration rates were 2.6%, 23.2% and 70.0%.\n The ?p through the pretreated N95 masks was 9.2 mm H2O at the breathing flow rate of heavy-duty workers, exceeding the ?p values obtained through Gauze and Spunlace masks.\n Decontamination increased the sizes of the most penetrating particles, changing the qf values of all of the masks: qf fell as particle size increased because the penetration increased.\n Bleach increased the ?p of N95, but destroyed the Gauze mask.\n However, the use of an autoclave reduces the ?p values of both the N95 and the Gauze mask.\n Neither the rice cooker nor ethanol altered the ?p of the Gauze mask.\n Chemical decontamination methods reduced the qf,o values for the three electret masks.\n The value of qf,o for PM0.1 exceeded that for PM0.1–0.6, because particles smaller than 100 nm had lower penetration, resulting in a better qf for a given pressure drop.\n The values of qf,o, particularly for PM0.1, reveal that for the tested treatments and masks, physical decontamination methods are less destructive to the filter than chemical methods.\n Nevertheless, when purchasing new or reusing FFRs, penetration should be regarded as the priority.\n","id":"PMC5638397","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Public Library of

characteristics of a formulation and have not assessed the behavior of the nasal formulation in the presence of varying types of mucus depending on the indication or diseased state.\n This research investigated the effects of nasal mucus on the dripping behavior of nasal formulations and focused on developing an improved in vitro analytical test method that is more physiologically relevant in characterizing nasal formulation dripping behavior.\n Method development was performed using simulated nasal mucus preparations for both healthy and diseased states as coatings for the dripping experiment representing a wide range of viscosity.\n Factors evaluated during development of this in vitro test method included amount of mucus, application of mucus, drying times, and compatibility of the mucus on a C18 Thin Layer Chromatography (TLC) substrate.\n The dripping behavior of nasal formulations containing a range of 1% Avicel to 3.5% Avicel was assessed by actuating the nasal spray on a perpendicular TLC plate coated with either healthy or diseased simulated nasal mucus.\n After actuation of the nasal spray, the dripping of the formulation on the coated TLC plate was measured after the plate was repositioned vertically.\n The method that was developed generated reproducible results on the dripping behavior of nasal formulations and provided critical information about the compatibility of the formulation with the nasal mucus for different diseased states, aiding in nasal spray formulation development and physical characterization of the nasal spray.\n","id":"PMC5762624","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Xi'an Jiaotong

aim of this study was to evaluate the pattern of heat resistance of minute virus of mice (MVM), coxsackievirus B4 (CVB4), influenza A virus (H1N1), and herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV1) contained in droplets.\n Four ?L droplets containing viruses (&gt; 104.5 TCID50) were applied onto warmed surface obtained by using a self-made heating device.\n Viral suspensions were exposed to temperatures ranging from 70 to 130°C for 0 to 90 min depending on the virus, and then the recovered viral preparations were tittered.\n Inactivation rates were calculated from curves that were analysed according to the first order kinetics model.\n Full inactivation was obtained for MVM in 90 min at 80°C and in 2 s at 130°C, for H1N1 in 14 s at 70°C and in 1 s at 110°C, for CVB4 and HSV-1 in 5 s and 7 s respectively at 70°C and in 1 s at 100°C.\n Clearly, MVM was more resistant than H1N1 that was more resistant than HSV-1 and CVB4, which was reflected by increasing inactivation rates.\n The impact of short time exposure to heat onto the infectivity of viruses contained in a small volume of suspension has been determined.\n For the first time, the inactivation of viral particles contained in drops exposed to temperatures higher than 100°C has been investigated.\n It appears that heating can have an unexpected faster virucidal effect than previously described.\n","id":"PMC4262365","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"The Japanese Society of Microbial Ecology (JSME)/The Japanese Society of Soil Microbiology

installed in the animal facility of an academic medical center.\n\n\nInterventions:\nid='P11'>One to five sterilization cycles using ionized hydrogen peroxide (iHP), generated by SteraMist® equipment (TOMI; Frederick, MD).\n\n\nMain outcome measures:\nid='P12'>Personal protective equipment, including five N95 mask models from three manufacturers, were evaluated for efficacy of sterilization following iHP treatment (measured with bacterial spores in standard biological indicator assemblies).\n\n Additionally, N95 masks were assessed for their ability to efficiently filter particles down to 0.3?m and for their ability to form an airtight seal using a quantitative fit test.\n\n Filtration efficiency was measured using ambient particulate matter at a university lab and an aerosolized NaCl challenge at a National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) pre-certification laboratory.\n\n\nResults:\nid='P13'>The data demonstrate that N95 masks sterilized using SteraMist iHP technology retain function up to five cycles, the maximum number tested to date.\n\n Some but not all PPE could also be sterilized using an iHP environmental chamber, but pre-treatment with a handheld iHP generator was required for semi-enclosed surfaces such as respirator hoses.\n\n\nConclusions:\nid='P14'>A typical iHP environment chamber with a volume of ~80 m3 can treat ~7000 masks per day, as well as other items of PPE, making this an effective approach for a busy medical center.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7273248","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Cold Spring Harbor

equipment for their selective reuse during pandemics","abstract":"Background\nid='Par1'>Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) is required to safely work with biological agents of bacterial (i.\n\ne.\n\n Mycobacterium tuberculosis) or viral origin (Ebola and SARS).\n\n COVID-19 pandemic especially has created unforeseen public health challenges including a global shortage of PPE needed for the safety of health care workers (HCWs).\n\n Although sufficient stocks of PPE are currently available, their critical shortage may develop soon due to increase in demand and depletion of existing supply lines.\n\n To empower our HCWs and ensure their continued protection, proactive measures are urgently required to develop procedures to safely decontaminate the PPEs to allow their “selective reuse” during contingency situations.\n\n\nMethods\nid='Par2'>Herein, we have successfully developed a decontamination method based on vaporized hydrogen peroxide (VHP).\n\n We have used a range of concentration of hydrogen peroxide to disinfect PPE (coveralls, face-shields, and N-95 masks).\n\n To ensure a proper disinfection, we have evaluated three biological indicators namely Escherichia coli, Mycobacterium smegmatis and spores of Bacillus stearothermophilus, considered as the gold standard for disinfection processes.\n\n We next evaluated the impact of repeated VHP treatment on physical features, permeability, and fabric integrity of coveralls and N-95 masks.\n\n Next, we performed Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) to evaluate microscopic changes in fiber thickness of N-95 masks, melt blown layer or coverall body suits.\n\n Considering the fact that any disinfection procedure should be able to meet local requirements, our study included various regionally procured N-95 masks and coveralls available at our institute All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), New Delhi, India.\n\n Lastly, the practical utility of VHP method developed herein was ascertained by operationalizing a dedicated research facility disinfecting used PPE during COVID-19.\nResults\nid='Par3'>Our prototype studies show that a single VHP cycle (7–8% Hydrogen peroxide) could disinfect PPE and PPE housing room of about 1200 cubic feet (length10 ft?×?breadth 10 ft?×?height 12 ft) in less than 10 min, as noted by a complete loss of B.\n\n stearothermophilus spore revival.\n\n The results are consistent and reproducible as tested in over 10 cycles in our settings.\n\n Further, repeated VHP treatment did not result in any physical tear, deformity or other appreciable change in the coverall and N-95 masks.\n\n Our permeation tests evaluating droplet penetration did not reveal any change in permeability post-VHP treatments.\n\n Also, SEM analysis indeed revealed no significant change in fiber thickness or damage to fibers of coveralls or melt blown layer of N-95 masks essential for filtration.\n\n There was no change in user comfort and experience following VHP treatment of PPE.\n\n Based on results of these studies, and parameters developed and optimized, an institutional research facility to disinfect COVID-19 PPE is successfully established and operationalized with more than 80% recovery rate for used PPE post-disinfection.\n\n\nConclusions\nid='Par4'>Our study, therefore, successfully establishes the utility of VHP to effectively disinfect PPE for a possible reuse as per the requirements.\n\n VHP treatment did not damage coveralls, cause physical deformity and also did not alter fabric architecture of melt blown layer.\n\n We observed that disinfection process was successful consistently and therefore believe that the VHP-based decontamination model will have a universal applicability and utility.\n\n This process can be easily and economically scaled up and can be instrumental in easing global PPE shortages in any biosafety facility or in health care settings during pandemic situation such as COVID-19.\n","id":"PMC7303439","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"BioMed

Taxonomic Analysis Establishes <italic>Mycobacterium indicus pranii</italic> as a Distinct Species","abstract":"Background\n\nMycobacterium indicus pranii (MIP), popularly known as Mw, is a cultivable, non-pathogenic organism, which, based on its growth and metabolic properties, is classified in Runyon Group IV along with M.\n\n fortuitum, M.\n\n smegmatis and M.\n\n vaccae.\n\n The novelty of this bacterium was accredited to its immunological ability to undergo antigen driven blast transformation of leukocytes and delayed hypersensitivity skin test in leprosy patients, a disease endemic in the Indian sub-continent.\n\n Consequently, MIP has been extensively evaluated for its biochemical and immunological properties leading to its usage as an immunomodulator in leprosy and tuberculosis patients.\n\n However, owing to advances in sequencing and culture techniques, the citing of new strains with almost 100% similarity in the sequences of marker genes like 16S rRNA, has compromised the identity of MIP as a novel species.\n\n Hence, to define its precise taxonomic position, we have carried out polyphasic taxonomic studies on MIP that integrate its phenotypic, chemotaxonomic and molecular phylogenetic attributes.\n\n\nMethodology/Principal Findings\nThe comparative analysis of 16S rRNA sequence of MIP by using BLAST algorithm at NCBI (nr database) revealed a similarity of ?99% with M.\n\n intracellulare, M.\n\n arosiense, M.\n\n chimaera, M.\n\n seoulense, M.\n\n avium subsp.\n\n hominissuis, M.\n\n avium subsp.\n\n paratuberculosis and M.\n\n bohemicum.\n\n Further analysis with other widely used markers like rpoB and hsp65 could resolve the phylogenetic relationship between MIP and other closely related mycobacteria apart from M.\n\n intracellulare and M.\n\n chimaera, which shares ?99% similarity with corresponding MIP orthologues.\n\n Molecular phylogenetic analysis, based on the concatenation of candidate orthologues of 16S rRNA, hsp65 and rpoB, also substantiated its distinctiveness from all the related organisms used in the analysis excluding M.\n\n intracellulare and M.\n\n chimaera with which it exhibited a close proximity.\n\n This necessitated further analysis of MIP with more sensitive and segregating parameters to ascertain its precise taxonomic position as a new species.\n\n The analysis of MIP and its comparison with other mycobacterial reference strains based on cellular and biochemical features, growth characteristics and chemotaxonomic studies like FAME profiling confirmed that MIP is uniquely endowed with diverse metabolic attributes that effectively distinguishes it from all the closely related mycobacteria including M.\n\n intracellulare and M.\n\n chimaera.\n\n\nConclusion\nThe results presented in this study coupled with the non-pathogenic nature and different biochemical and immunomodulatory properties of MIP affirm it as a distinct species belonging to M.\n\n avium complex (MAC).\n\n It is further proposed to use an earlier suggested name Mycobacterium indicus pranii for this newly established mycobacterial species.\n\n This study also exemplifies the growing need for a uniform, consensus based broader polyphasic frame work for the purpose of taxonomy and speciation, particularly in the genus Mycobacterium.\n\n\n","id":"PMC2707620","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Public Library of

saprophytic mycobacteria.\n\n The ability of mycobacteria to colonize hosts, to proliferate and to cause diseases has evolved due to its predisposition to various evolutionary forces acting over a period of time.\n\n Mycobacterium indicus pranii (MIP), a taxonomically unknown ‘generalist’ mycobacterium, acts as an immunotherapeutic against leprosy and is approved for use as a vaccine against it.\n\n The large-scale field trials of this MIP based leprosy vaccine coupled with its demonstrated immunomodulatory and adjuvant property has led to human clinical evaluations of MIP in interventions against HIV-AIDS, psoriasis and bladder cancer.\n\n MIP, commercially available as ‘Immuvac’, is currently the focus of advanced phase III clinical trials for its antituberculosis efficacy.\n\n Thus a comprehensive analysis of MIP vis-à-vis evolutionary path, underpinning its immanent immunomodulating properties is of the highest desiderata.\n\n\nPrincipal Findings\nGenome wide comparisons together with molecular phylogenetic analyses by fluorescent amplified fragment length polymorphism (FAFLP), enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus (ERIC) based genotyping and candidate orthologues sequencing revealed that MIP has been the predecessor of highly pathogenic Mycobacterium avium intracellulare complex (MAIC) that did not resort to parasitic adaptation by reductional gene evolution and therefore, preferred a free living life-style.\n\n Further analysis suggested a shared aquatic phase of MAIC bacilli with the early pathogenic forms of Mycobacterium, well before the latter diverged as ‘specialists’.\n\n\nConclusions/Significance\nThis evolutionary paradigm possibly affirms to marshal our understanding about the acquisition and optimization of

during an influenza pandemic.\n One possible strategy to mitigate a respirator shortage is to reuse FFRs following a biological decontamination process to render infectious material on the FFR inactive.\n However, little data exist on the effects of decontamination methods on respirator integrity and performance.\n This study evaluated five decontamination methods [ultraviolet germicidal irradiation (UVGI), ethylene oxide, vaporized hydrogen peroxide (VHP), microwave oven irradiation, and bleach] using nine models of NIOSH-certified respirators (three models each of N95 FFRs, surgical N95 respirators, and P100 FFRs) to determine which methods should be considered for future research studies.\n Following treatment by each decontamination method, the FFRs were evaluated for changes in physical appearance, odor, and laboratory performance (filter aerosol penetration and filter airflow resistance).\n Additional experiments (dry heat laboratory oven exposures, off-gassing, and FFR hydrophobicity) were subsequently conducted to better understand material properties and possible health risks to the respirator user following decontamination.\n However, this study did not assess the efficiency of the decontamination methods to inactivate viable microorganisms.\n Microwave oven irradiation melted samples from two FFR models.\n The remainder of the FFR samples that had been decontaminated had expected levels of filter aerosol penetration and filter airflow resistance.\n The scent of bleach remained noticeable following overnight drying and low levels of chlorine gas were found to off-gas from bleach-decontaminated FFRs when rehydrated with deionized water.\n UVGI, ethylene oxide (EtO), and VHP were found to be the most promising decontamination methods; however, concerns remain about the throughput capabilities for EtO and VHP.\n Further research is needed before any specific decontamination methods can be

protect the environment, and help solve the current imminent shortage of masks.\n Disinfection of used masks is needed for their reuse with safety, but improper decontamination can damage the blocking structure of masks.\n In this study, we demonstrated using the avian coronavirus of infectious bronchitis virus to mimic SARS?CoV?2 that MMs and N95Ms retained their blocking efficacy even after being steamed on boiling water for 2?hours.\n We also demonstrated that three brands of MMs blocked over 99% viruses in aerosols.\n The avian coronavirus was completely inactivated after being steamed for 5?minutes.\n Altogether, this study suggested that MMs are adequate for use on most social occasions and both MMs and N95Ms can be reused for a few days with steam decontamination between

SARS?CoV?2","abstract":"The surge of patients in the pandemic of COVID?19 caused by the novel coronavirus SARS?CoV?2 may overwhelm the medical systems of many countries.\n Mask?wearing and handwashing can slow the spread of the virus, but currently, masks are in shortage in many countries, and timely handwashing is often impossible.\n In this study, the efficacy of three types of masks and instant hand wiping was evaluated using the avian influenza virus to mock the coronavirus.\n Virus quantification was performed using real?time reverse transcription?polymerase chain reaction.\n Previous studies on mask?wearing were reviewed.\n The results showed that instant hand wiping using a wet towel soaked in water containing 1.00% soap powder, 0.05% active chlorine, or 0.25% active chlorine from sodium hypochlorite removed 98.36%, 96.62%, and 99.98% of the virus from hands, respectively.\n N95 masks, medical masks, and homemade masks made of four?layer kitchen paper and one?layer cloth could block 99.98%, 97.14%, and 95.15% of the virus in aerosols.\n Medical mask?wearing which was supported by many studies was opposed by other studies possibly due to erroneous judgment.\n With these data, we propose the approach of mask?wearing plus instant hand hygiene (MIH) to slow the exponential spread of the virus.\n This MIH approach has been supported by the experiences of seven countries in fighting against COVID?19. Collectively, a simple approach to slow the exponential spread of SARS?CoV?2 was proposed with the support of experiments, literature review, and control experiences.\n","id":"PMC7228401","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"John Wiley and Sons Inc.","authors":[{"firstname":"Qing?Xia","surname":"Ma","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Hu","surname":"Shan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Hong?Liang","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Gui?Mei","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Rui?Mei","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ji?Ming","surname":"Chen","email":"jmchen678@qq.com","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1002/jmv.25846","date":"2020-04-06","title":"Mask is the possible key for self?isolation in COVID?19 pandemic","abstract":"","id":"PMC7262254","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"John Wiley and Sons Inc.","authors":[{"firstname":"Zhiguo","surname":"Zhou","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Dongsheng","surname":"Yue","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Chenlu","surname":"Mu","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Lei","surname":"Zhang","email":"raymd728@qq.com","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"  .
