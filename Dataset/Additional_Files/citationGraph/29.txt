It can reduce help-seeking behaviour and treatment adherence. The effectiveness of interventions aimed at reducing self-stigma in people with mental illness is systematically reviewed. Results are discussed in the context of a logic model of the broader social context of mental illness stigma. \nMethods: Medline, Embase, PsycINFO, ERIC, and CENTRAL were searched for randomized controlled trials in November 2013. Studies were assessed with the Cochrane risk of bias tool.\nResults: Five trials were eligible for inclusion, four of which provided data for statistical analyses. Four studies had a high risk of bias. The quality of evidence was very low for each set of interventions and outcomes. The interventions studied included various group based anti-stigma interventions and an anti-stigma booklet. The intensity and fidelity of most interventions was high. Two studies were considered to be sufficiently homogeneous to be pooled for the outcome self-stigma. The meta-analysis did not find a statistically significant effect (SMD [95% CI] at 3 months: -0.26 [-0.64, 0.12], I2=0%, n=108). None of the individual studies found sustainable effects on other outcomes, including recovery, help-seeking behaviour and self-stigma.\nConclusions: The effectiveness of interventions against self-stigma is uncertain. Previous studies lacked statistical power, used questionable outcome measures and had a high risk of bias. Future studies should be based on robust methods and consider practical implications regarding intervention development (relevance, implementability, and placement in routine services).\nIntroduction\nReducing the stigmatisation towards people with mental illnesses is one of the major goals of the World Health Organization's Mental Health Action Plan. Stigma occurs when &quot;elements of labelling, stereotyping, separation, status loss, and discrimination occur together in a power situation that allows them&quot;. The negative consequences are far-reaching. Self-stigma can diminish people's self-esteem and self-efficacy and negatively affect emotional well-being and personal relationships,. It can have a negative impact on help-seeking behaviour, treatment adherence, and recovery,,. The number of people who report some degree of self-stigma is significant. A recent systematic review of self-stigma in people with schizophrenia spectrum disorders found a self-stigma prevalence rate of 49%, highlighting the importance of the issue. Another study estimated that self-stigma occurs in about 22% of people with bipolar disorder or depression.\nBased on the aforementioned correlates of self-stigma, it is suggested that interventions reducing self-stigma may indirectly improve mental health related outcomes by improving help-seeking and adherence and empower people to attain their life goals. The following systematic review aims to investigate the benefits and harms of interventions for reducing or preventing self-stigma in people with a diagnosis of any mental illness treated in the community or as inpatients. \nBackground\nStigma can present on three levels: Public or social stigma is defined as a negative reaction of the general population towards the stigmatised group based on stereotypes such as the belief that all people with mental illnesses are dangerous or incompetent. Structural or institutional stigma involves practices of private or public institutions that restrict the rights of stigmatised groups through rules, policies or processes. Self-stigma (also referred to as internalized stigma) occurs when people with mental illnesses accept the public stigma and incorporate it into their self-concept.\nInterventions addressing self-stigma are usually complex in nature. They are, furthermore, embedded in the wider lives of people with mental illnesses and may interact with these - after all, stigma is (to some extent at least) socially constructed and resides in a larger context that includes social relationships, personal finances, treatments and other sources of support as well as patients' educational, working and living environment, for example. Based on fundamental cause theory, Hatzenbuehler and colleagues have argued that stigma may fulfil the criteria for a fundamental social cause, i.e. a social factor that remains associated with inequalities through the repeated production of mechanisms that link it with health. \nPhelan and colleagues argue that stigma can have three functions: 1) domination (exploiting others and keeping them down in order to maintain wealth and power); 2) enforcement of social norms (making people comply with social norms); and 3) avoidance of disease (keeping people away).\nAgainst this background, we developed a logic model in order to grasp how self-stigma is embedded in the social context of people with a mental illness and how it may be addressed (Figure 1 (Fig. 1)). This helped us to operationalize the research question of this review, specify the inclusion criteria and interpret the findings in context. For the purpose of this review a simple approach was used by mapping essential intervention components into inputs, processes and outcomes (included literature is provided in the Attachment 1). \nMaterial and methods\nInclusion criteria\nWe included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of people with a clinically verified diagnosis of mental illness according to the DSM or ICD. We did not restrict studies by setting. Any intervention with the aim of reducing or preventing self-stigma was considered. Candidate interventions included psychoeducational interventions, cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), mutual health programs (peer support interventions) as well as specific programs such as &quot;coming out proud&quot; and narrative enhancement and cognitive therapy (NECT) (see Attachment 1). All types of control interventions were allowed, including waiting list controls, attention controls, no intervention controls, and active controls.\nOutcomes were drawn from the proposed logic model. They were divided into treatment-related outcomes (e.g. recovery, treatment adherence, quality of life); social outcomes (e.g. vocational or educational success, experienced stigma); personal (psychological) outcomes (e.g. self-stigma, perceived stigma, self-efficacy, self-esteem), life achievements (e.g. employment, education) and adverse effects. Length of follow-up was categorized into short-term (&lt;3 months), medium-term (3-6 months) and long-term (&gt;6 months). \nSearch strategy and selection of studies\nMedline, Embase, PsycINFO, ERIC, and the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register were searched using a combination of search terms related to mental illnesses and self-stigma in combination with a validated filter for RCTs, where available. In addition, reference lists of included studies and previous reviews were inspected for further potentially relevant articles. The WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) and the NIH clinical trial database (https://clinicaltrials.gov/) were searched for ongoing studies. The search strategy was developed using a conceptual approach. A sample search strategy for Medline is provided in the attachment. Searches were conducted in November 2013. In May 2014 we checked whether any studies identified through study registries had been published. We did not restrict searches to specific languages. \nTitles and abstracts of the initial search results were screened for potentially relevant studies by the primary reviewer (RB). A second reviewer (MM) screened a random 20% sample of these as a means of quality assurance. Full texts of potentially relevant studies were retrieved and assessed for eligibility independently by both reviewers. Disagreements were resolved through discussion. \nData extraction and assessment of included studies\nIndividual study data were extracted into standardized sheets using Covidence web software and included information on study ID, patient and intervention characteristics, outcome data and risk of bias items. Statistical data and information on risk of bias items were extracted by one reviewer (RB) and checked for accuracy by a second reviewer (MM). Disagreements were resolved through consensus. The extracted data were exported into Review Manager 5.2 for statistical analysis. Risk of bias was assessed in accordance with the Cochrane risk of bias tool. Additional information was sought from the authors of the included studies where the published reports did not provide sufficient information. \nData analysis\nIt was planned to conduct meta-analyses for each group of interventions (e.g. interventions based on CBT methods versus waiting list control), if studies were deemed to be sufficiently homogeneous to be pooled statistically and in terms of clinical aspects. Data were considered statistically too heterogeneous for pooling if I2 was above 50% accompanied by a significant Chi2 test (p&lt;0.1). We used random-effects models (REMs) in meta-analyses because we expected interventions which were at least somewhat heterogeneous. Continuous data derived from the same scale were analysed as differences in means (MD). If different scales were used to measure the same construct (e.g. self-stigma or quality of life), and the scales were deemed similar enough to be pooled, standardised mean differences (SMD) were calculated. For binary outcomes we calculated odds ratios. We attempted to conduct statistical analyses based on the intention to treat (ITT) principle, i.e. all participants were analysed in the group to which they were allocated. Where study reports only provided results from a per-protocol analysis, we contacted authors to obtain data from the ITT population. If studies failed to report information on variances for group means, these were calculated from p values, t values or confidence intervals in accordance with the methods described in the Cochrane Handbook.\nResults\nThe initial electronic database searches resulted in 5,266 potentially relevant references. After duplicates were removed electronically in EndNote, 4,731 references remained. Of these, 4,702 were excluded based on their titles and abstracts. Thirty studies were considered to potentially fulfil the eligibility criteria and retrieved for full text screening. Twenty-four of these studies were excluded after the predefined inclusion criteria were applied. One additional study was excluded, because it was not considered to be a genuine randomized trial during the data extraction process. An additional potentially relevant study was identified by screening the reference lists of the included articles, but failed to fulfill the inclusion criteria. Seven on-going studies considered to be potentially eligible for this systematic review were identified from ICTRP and the clinicaltrials.gov. The publication status of these trials was checked before publication. Two of the registered trials had been published by this time, but neither of them fulfilled the inclusion criteria,. The search process is documented with a flow chart in accordance with the PRISMA statement (Figure 2 (Fig. 2)). A list of excluded studies with reasons for exclusion is included in the Attachment 1. \nCharacteristics of included studies\nFive randomized trials were included,,,,. All included studies were two-arm randomized controlled trials with an inactive or attention control published within the last decade. \nThe trials studied a variety of interventions. Four of the interventions were self-stigma reduction programs consisting of a series of group sessions. The specific interventions differed in their content and intensity. While the interventions were heterogeneous in nature, there was also some overlap: all of them included elements of psychoeducation and either CBT techniques or methods aimed at helping participants to develop a personally helpful identity. \nOne study was quite different to the aforementioned ones in terms of the intervention and objective. It evaluated a brochure that aimed at reducing barriers to seeking treatment. While the other studies directly addressed internalized stigma, this study was concerned with perceived stigma in that it addressed beliefs participants held about the potential reactions of others towards seeking mental health treatment and how they believed mental illness was perceived at the societal level. Four studies had a maximum follow-up of three months, while the longest follow-up was 6 months in one study. A detailed table of study characteristics, including information on the reported outcomes, is included in the Attachment 1.\nResults of quality assessment\nOverall, the quality of reporting of the included trials was poor. Figure 3 (Fig. 3) summarizes the risk of bias assessments for each included study. Details including the rationale for the judgements per item and study are provided in the Attachment 1. Baseline characteristics of participants were not available separately for the intervention and control groups in two studies, and sample sizes per group and standard deviations were not always fully reported. Fortunately, the authors of three studies provided these data upon request.\nEffects of interventions\nDue to the heterogeneity between the studies we present the results by interventions. Effect sizes for each study and outcome are summarized in Table 1 (Tab. 1). \nMeta-analytic effect of identity enhancing interventions on self-stigma\nTwo of the group-based intervention studies evaluated the effect of identity enhancing interventions, namely photovoice and narrative enhancement/cognitive therapy,. These were the only two studies that we considered to be sufficiently homogeneous to be statistically pooled in that they both primarily included participants with a mix of DSM-IV diagnoses; evaluated a group intervention that included a combination of psychoeducation and techniques aimed at helping participants to develop personally meaningful identities; measured self-stigma on the Internalized Stigma of Mental Illness Scale (ISMI); and were statistically homogeneous (I2=0%, p&gt;0.1). \nThe ISMI is a self-report measure consisting of 29 items. Each item is measured on a 4-point Likert scale from 1 to 4, where a higher value denotes higher levels of self-stigma. The ISMI uses an index value that is calculated as the average value across all items. The ISMI was tested in an independent sample of mental health patients with various ICD-9 diagnoses including schizophrenia and depression and has good psychometric properties.\nRussinova and colleagues used the ISMI as originally proposed, while Yanos and colleagues modified the instrument in a few aspects. Specifically, the stigma resistance subscale of the ISMI was reported separately. Possibly this was done because this subscale uses reverse-coded items, but the actual reasons were not reported. Furthermore, a Likert scale from 0 to 3 was used instead of the original Likert scale, which ranges from 1 to 4. The reasons for this were not reported. Lastly, the scores from the subscales were summed up in the NECT trial, while the photovoice study reported the average of the subscale scores, as the developers of the instrument have done in previous studies. Due to the differences in how the ISMI was used in the two studies, standardised mean differences (SMD) were calculated in the meta-analysis instead of using the original scale. The pooled results suggest a small, but statistically insignificant effect of the interventions on self-stigma (post-intervention: SMD -0.24 [-0.61, 0.14], 3-month: -0.26 [-0.64, 0.12]). A forest plot of the meta-analysis can be found in Figure 4 (Fig. 4).\nPhotovoice\nRussinova and colleagues also assessed the effect of photovoice on empowerment and recovery. Empowerment was measured using the Empowerment Scale (ES). The ES consists of 28 items, each measured on a 4-point Likert scale from 1 to 4, where higher values indicate stronger feelings of empowerment. An index value is calculated by averaging the individual items. Thus, possible overall scores range from 1 to 4. The scale was developed for use with mental health consumers and appears to have good psychometric properties. The instrument measures five domains: self-esteem/self-efficacy, power, community involvement and autonomy, optimism and righteous anger. There was no significant effect of photovoice on empowerment (post-intervention: MD 0.05 [-0.09, 0.19]; 3-month: MD 0.01 [-0.14, 0.16]). \nThe effect of photovoice on recovery was measured on the Personal Growth and Recovery Scale (PGRS), a self-report outcome developed specifically for the study. The PGRS has 25 items, which are measured on a 4-point Likert scale, where a higher value indicates a higher level of perceived growth and recovery. The authors reported an index value, which was calculated as the average of the items (thus, the possible values for the outcome ranged from 1 to 4). While the authors report good psychometric properties, these results should be considered cautiously due to lack of evaluation in other cohorts. The study did not show a significant effect of photovoice on recovery immediately after the intervention or at three-month follow-up (post-intervention: MD 0.12 [-0.15, 0.39], 3-month: MD 0.21 [-0.03, 0.45]). \nNarrative enhancement/cognitive therapy (NECT)\nYanos and colleagues also measured the effect of NECT on self-esteem and quality of life. Self-esteem was measured on the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale (RSES). The instrument consists of 10 items measured on a 4-point Likert scale. The possible overall score ranges from 0 to 30, where a higher index value indicates higher levels of self-esteem. The RSES is a widely used measure of global self-esteem, which has been tested in a population of mental health patients and is considered to have good psychometric properties. The study did not show an effect of NECT on self-esteem (post-intervention: MD 0.07 [-0.36, 0.50]; 3-month: MD -0.07 [-0.50, 0.36]). The sample had extremely low baseline values of self-esteem, however, suggesting a possible floor effect. \nQuality of life was measured on the Quality of Life Scale (QLS). The QLS is a therapist-reported instrument consisting of 21 items. Each item is measured on a 7-point Likert scale ranging from 0 to 6, where higher values indicate better functioning. The QLS was developed specifically for people with schizophrenia and measures four domains: relationships, occupational functioning, psychological functioning (sense of purpose, motivation etc.) and community participation. An index value is calculated by adding up the average scores from the subscales. Thus, possible values range from 0 to 28. The QLS has good psychometric properties and is considered to be the gold standard for measuring health-related quality of life in people with schizophrenia. There was no significant effect of NECT on quality of life (post-intervention: MD 2.80 [-6.78, 12.38]; 3-month: MD -4.74 [-16.18, 6.70]). The wide confidence interval includes both a potential beneficial or harmful effect. Note that the data on quality of life for this analysis come from the as-treated population, as the author did not provide data from the ITT population for this outcome.\nMulti-faceted anti-stigma program\nFung and colleagues measured the effect of their program on self-stigma, self efficacy, treatment participation, and adherence. Self-stigma was measured using the Chinese version of the Self-Stigma in Mental Illness Scale (SSMIS). This scale consists of four subscales without an index value. The subscales are ordered hierarchically in that they represent four progressive stages of stigma, namely stereotype agreement, stereotype awareness, self-concurrence and self-esteem decrement. Each subscale consists of 15 items rated on a scale from 1 to 9, where higher values indicate stronger self-stigma. The possible index values for each subscale range from 15 to 135. Studies suggest acceptable psychometric properties for the SSMIS, although the internal consistency of the instrument is not well-established.\nDue to the large number of subscales, the results for each SSMIS subscale are not presented here in full, but can be found in Table 1 (Tab. 1). In sum, there was no significant effect for any of the subscales at long-term follow-up. There was a relatively large baseline imbalance in favour of the control group for three of the subscales (9 to 14 points, data not shown). However, even when this is taken into account, the wide confidence intervals are compatible with no effect and preclude any meaningful conclusions. \nThe effect of Fung et al.'s multi-faceted anti-stigma program on self-efficacy was measured with the Chinese General Self-efficacy Scale (CGSS). This instrument consists of 10 items measured on a 4-point Likert scale. The possible overall score ranges from 10 to 40, where a higher value indicates higher levels of self-esteem. The instrument has been tested with people with mental illness and has good psychometric properties. Statistically significant effects were found post-intervention and at the 6-month follow-up, but not at intermediate time points (post-intervention: MD -4.02 [-7.08, -0.96]; 2-month: MD -0.17 [-2.83, 2.49]; 4-month: -2.43 [-5.39, 0.53]; 6-month: -3.12 [-6.04, -0.20]). \nThe effect of the program on treatment participation and adherence were measured on two subscales of the Psychosocial Treatment Compliance Scale (PTCS). The PTCS is a therapist-reported outcome, which is used to rate attendance and adherence to various psychosocial treatments in the last three months. Attendance is based on 5 items measured on a 5-point Likert scale, where a higher value denotes better participation. Possible overall scores range from 5 to 25. Adherence is measured on twelve 5-point Likert scale items, where higher values denote better participation. Possible overall scores for adherence range from 12 to 60. A study in an independent cohort of people with a DSM-IV diagnosis of schizophrenia or other types of psychosis suggests good psychometric properties of the scale.\nThe study did not show a positive effect of the intervention on treatment attendance compared to an attention control group at any of the time points (post intervention: MD 1.12 [-0.49, 2.73]; 2-month: MD 0.50 [-1.01, 2.01]; 4-month: MD 0.56 [-0.83, 1.95]; 6-month MD 0.13 [-1.39, 1.65]). There was a significant effect of the anti-stigma program on treatment adherence post-intervention and at the 2-month follow-up, but these effects were not sustained (post-intervention: MD 3.52 [0.74, 6.30]; 2-month: MD 3.19 [0.17, 6.21]; 4-month: MD 2.79 [-0.20, 5.78]; 6-month: MD 1.90 [-1.55, 5.35]). \nAnti-stigma booklet\nAlvidrez and colleagues measured the effect of their anti-stigma booklet on help-seeking behaviour, treatment adherence and perceived stigma. Help-seeking behaviour was measured as the rate of participants that entered treatment following provision of the booklet. No significant effect of the intervention on help-seeking behaviour was found (OR 1.46 [0.37, 5.80]). \nTreatment adherence was measured as the number of attended treatment sessions. There was no significant effect of the anti-stigma booklet on treatment adherence (3-month: MD 0.20 [-2.89, 3.29]).\nPerceived stigma was measured using the Perceived Devaluation and Discrimination Scale (PDD), a self-complete measure consisting of 12 items. Each item is measured on a 6-point Likert scale, where higher values indicate higher levels of perceived stigma. The study provided a summary score by averaging the values from each item. The psychometric properties of the PDD are not well established. There was no effect of the anti-stigma booklet on perceived stigma (3-month: MD 0.00 [-0.54, 0.54]). \nDiscussion\nThe systematic review found insufficient evidence on the effectiveness of interventions to reduce self-stigma in people with mental illness. It should not be concluded that interventions aimed at reducing self-stigma in people with mental illnesses are ineffective, however. The sparse evidence and a number of methodological reasons that reside in the limitation of the included studies might explain the disappointing results.\nThe heterogeneity of the studies, particularly in terms of interventions and outcomes, only allowed for one meta-analysis, resulting in low statistical power due to the small sample sizes of the included trials. Furthermore, the studies also have a number of methodological limitations. All but one trial were considered to be at high risk of bias, and none of the included studies was considered to have a low risk of bias. Performance bias was difficult to assess, since treatment-as-usual was rarely described in the studies and none of the studies included information on potential co-interventions.\nThe outcomes measures also provide a possible explanation for the lack of effect. Most of the scales that were used had acceptable psychometric properties in terms of reliability, internal consistency and content validity, for example. Their suitability for the evaluation of interventions is questionable, however, since most of them have been developed as survey measures, rather than for use in interventional research. For example, information on possible floor and ceiling effects are missing for most of the scales, as well as evidence of whether they are responsive to change. The Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale, for example, has been reported as being very unresponsive to change. Furthermore, most of the instruments were based on 4-point Likert scales and thus may lack the ability to capture sufficient variability. \nA further limitation of the included studies is that none of them considered harms. Potential adverse effects of anti-stigma interventions include upsetting feelings, worsening of self-stigma, and negative effects of revealing the illness to others as a result of the intervention such as disapproval, exclusion or worry about not being treated as an equal. \nStrengths and limitations\nWe used state of the art systematic review methods to identify, assess and synthesise evidence in order to avoid bias wherever possible. In order to make judgements as transparent as possible, we thoroughly documented and reported the review in accordance with PRISMA guidance. Some limitations of the reviews should be highlighted though. The primary reviewer (RB) screened all references, while only a 20% sample of the references was screened by a second reviewer (MM). Although the agreement between the reviewers was good (Cohen's Kappa kappa=0.71), it was not excellent. \nDecisions concerning intervention eligibility were not always clear cut. In particular, some interventions were developed in order to address specific aspects of mental illness related to self-stigma, such as self-esteem or empowerment (for example). Since the aim of this review was to answer the question whether interventions specifically addressing self-stigma are effective, such studies were excluded on grounds that self-stigma was not the subject of the intervention. Lastly, publication bias is always a concern in systematic reviews - particularly in fields where studies are small and individual trials may have an important impact on the results. Due to the small number of studies and their heterogeneity it was not possible to examine publication bias statistically - for example using a funnel plot - or conduct corresponding sensitivity analyses. \nComparison with other reviews\nMittal and colleagues also acknowledged that the evidence for interventions against self-stigma is preliminary. However, they suggested that some interventions had &quot;promising&quot; effects, in contrast to this review, which did not find any encouraging results. The authors did not use a stringent approach to analysing data and assessing risk of bias, which makes comparisons with this review difficult. The main reason for the discordant conclusion seems to lie in the underlying studies. Mittal and colleagues included studies of patients without a clear DSM or ICD diagnosis as well as a variety of study designs. In effect, the overlap in the evidence base between the reviews is small, which accounts for the somewhat discordant conclusions. \nGriffiths et al. pooled the results of four RCTs on self-stigma and did not find a significant effect (d=0.16; 95% CI: -0.41 to 0.73, p=0.57). Their meta-analysis was statistically highly heterogeneous, however (I2=74%). Yanos and colleagues conducted a narrative review of interventions addressing self-stigma. As they did not provide any statistical data, it is difficult to make a comparison of the results of our reviews. However, they agree that much of the research on interventions addressing self-stigma is still in the early stages and that a deeper conversation about the aims, design and evaluation of interventions addressing self-stigma is required. A very recent meta-analysis by Tsang and colleagues found small, but significant effects in favour of interventions addressing self-stigma with standardised mean differences ranging from -0.33 to -0.43 in the pooled analyses. The confidence intervals were wide, however, questioning their clinical importance. The quality of evidence is further weakened due to inclusion of unrandomised and uncontrolled studies. Furthermore, the authors pooled highly heterogeneous interventions ranging from intensive group programs addressing self-stigma to novel care models, making the meta-analyses difficult to interpret. While the authors do not consider the wider societal and care system implications of the interventions in contrast to our review, they agree that more and better quality research into interventions addressing self-stigma is warranted. \nAvenues for further research\nThe studies included in this review were highly heterogeneous in both their intervention components and the composition of their participants. In order to successfully advance the intervention research on stigma reduction, we believe it would be helpful to take a step back and develop a sound theoretical base for the development of interventions and consider their active ingredients. This would ideally include the involvement of people who experience stigmatisation in order to better consider their needs. These might be sensitive to, for example, questions around the timing of such interventions (e.g. at the beginning of treatment or when the condition has stabilised; or when there is a risk of chronification or after discharge from an inpatient treatment) as well as the type of delivery (e.g. group-based or individually; through peers or professionals; in person or by other means). \nFurthermore, following Hatzenbuchler et al. and Phelan et al., reducing the negative effects of stigma is likely to require policies and interventions that address the social cause itself as well as the various mediators that link it to health, including self-stigma,. The implication is that in order to address stigma, the motivation or power required to stigmatize others needs to be addressed.\nA discussion is also needed about whether it makes sense to address self-stigma across many different mental health illnesses such as major depression, schizophrenia and social anxiety disorder. People with different mental health illnesses may have varying needs. These may also depend on other (potentially stigmatising) factors such as employment, gender and ethnicity. Lastly, we believe that it would be helpful to think about the differentiation between interventions specifically addressing self-stigma and other non-drug interventions, which may implicitly or explicitly address self-stigma, such as psychotherapy or self-help - and whether such a boundary is helpful. \nFuture interventions aimed at addressing self-stigma should take into account the available literature in a systematic fashion, and involve key stakeholders in the interventions development process. Future studies should be based on adequate power calculations and be reported in accordance with current reporting guidelines for randomised trials and complex interventions. Outcomes should be defined in a participatory process together with people affected by mental illnesses to ensure that they reflect their needs. Public mental health professionals should not assume that interventions aimed at reducing self-stigma in people with mental illnesses will translate into better outcomes, if they are used without considering other contextual factors.\nNotes\nAcknowledgements\nWe did not receive funding for this work.

health help-seeking in young people: a systematic review","abstract":"Background\nAdolescents and young adults frequently experience mental disorders, yet tend not to seek help.\n\n This systematic review aims to summarise reported barriers and facilitators of help-seeking in young people using both qualitative research from surveys, focus groups, and interviews and quantitative data from published surveys.\n\n It extends previous reviews through its systematic research methodology and by the inclusion of published studies describing what young people themselves perceive are the barriers and facilitators to help-seeking for common mental health problems.\n\n\nMethods\nTwenty two published studies of perceived barriers or facilitators in adolescents or young adults were identified through searches of PubMed, PsycInfo, and the Cochrane database.\n\n A thematic analysis was undertaken on the results reported in the qualitative literature and quantitative literature.\n\n\nResults\nFifteen qualitative and seven quantitative studies were identified.\n\n Young people perceived stigma and embarrassment, problems recognising symptoms (poor mental health literacy), and a preference for self-reliance as the most important barriers to help-seeking.\n\n Facilitators were comparatively under-researched.\n\n However, there was evidence that young people perceived positive past experiences, and social support and encouragement from others as aids to the help-seeking process.\n\n\nConclusions\nStrategies for improving help-seeking by adolescents and young adults should focus on improving mental health literacy, reducing stigma, and taking into account the desire of young people for self-reliance.\n\n\n","id":"PMC3022639","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"BioMed

adolescents: A population based survey","abstract":"Background\nOnly a minority of adolescents reporting symptoms above case-levels on screenings for mental health seeks and receives help from specialist health services.\n\n The objective of this study was to a) examine help-seeking for symptoms of anxiety and depression in relation to symptom load dimensionally, b) identify the level of specialization in mental health among service-providers, and c) identify associations between mental health problems and contact with different types of health services.\n\n\nMethods\nThis cross-sectional school-based study (response-rate 88%, n = 11154) is based on Norwegian health surveys among 15 and 16 year olds.\n\n\nResults\nWe found a dose-response association between symptom-load and help seeking.\n\n Only 34% of individuals with mental symptom-load above 99th percentile reported help-seeking in the last 12 months.\n\n Forty percent of help seekers were in contact with specialists (psychiatrists or psychologists), the remaining were mainly in contact with GPs.\n\n Mental health problems increased help seeking to all twelve service providers examined.\n\n\nConclusion\nIt might not be reasonable to argue that all adolescents with case-level mental health problems are in need of treatment.\n\n However, concerning the 99th percentile, claiming treatment need is less controversial.\n\n Even in the Norwegian context where mental health services are relatively available and free of charge, help-seeking in individuals with the highest symptom-loads is still low.\n\n Most help seekers achieved contact with health care providers, half of them at a non specialized level.\n\n Our results suggest that adolescents' recognition of mental health problems or intention to seek help for these are the major 'filters' restricting treatment.\n\n\n","id":"PMC1386725","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"BioMed

objectively derived search strategies","abstract":"Background\nOver the past few years, information retrieval has become more and more professionalized, and information specialists are considered full members of a research team conducting systematic reviews.\n\n Research groups preparing systematic reviews and clinical practice guidelines have been the driving force in the development of search strategies, but open questions remain regarding the transparency of the development process and the available resources.\n\n An empirically guided approach to the development of a search strategy provides a way to increase transparency and efficiency.\n\n\nMethods\nOur aim in this paper is to describe the empirically guided development process for search strategies as applied by the German Institute for Quality and Efficiency in Health Care (Institut für Qualität und Wirtschaftlichkeit im Gesundheitswesen, or 'IQWiG').\n\n This strategy consists of the following steps: generation of a test set, as well as the development, validation and standardized documentation of the search strategy.\n\n\nResults\nWe illustrate our approach by means of an example, that is, a search for literature on brachytherapy in patients with prostate cancer.\n\n For this purpose, a test set was generated, including a total of 38 references from 3 systematic reviews.\n\n The development set for the generation of the strategy included 25 references.\n\n After application of textual analytic procedures, a strategy was developed that included all references in the development set.\n\n To test the search strategy on an independent set of references, the remaining 13 references in the test set (the validation set) were used.\n\n The validation set was also completely identified.\n\n\nDiscussion\nOur conclusion is that an objectively derived approach similar to that used in search filter development is a feasible way to develop and validate reliable search strategies.\n\n Besides creating high-quality strategies, the widespread application of this approach will result in a substantial increase in the transparency of the development process of search strategies.\n\n\n","id":"PMC3351720","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"BioMed

filter for finding studies on measurement properties of measurement instruments","abstract":"Objectives\nFor the measurement of patient-reported outcomes, such as (health-related) quality of life, often many measurement instruments exist that intend to measure the same construct.\n\n To facilitate instrument selection, our aim was to develop a highly sensitive search filter for finding studies on measurement properties of measurement instruments in PubMed and a more precise search filter that needs less abstracts to be screened, but at a higher risk of missing relevant studies.\n\n\nMethods\nA random sample of 10,000 PubMed records (01-01-1990 to 31-12-2006) was used as a gold standard.\n\n Studies on measurement properties were identified using an exclusion filter and hand searching.\n\n Search terms were selected from the relevant records in the gold standard as well as from 100 systematic reviews of measurement properties and combined based on sensitivity and precision.\n\n The performance of the filters was tested in the gold standard as well as in two validation sets, by calculating sensitivity, precision, specificity, and number needed to read.\n\n\nResults\nWe identified 116 studies on measurement properties in the gold standard.\n\n The sensitive search filter was able to retrieve 113 of these 116 studies (sensitivity 97.4%, precision 4.4%).\n\n The precise search filter had a sensitivity of 93.1% and a precision of 9.4%.\n\n Both filters performed very well in the validation sets.\n\n\nConclusion\nThe use of these search filters will contribute to evidence-based selection of measurement instruments in all medical fields.\n\n\n","id":"PMC2744791","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Springer

approach using evidence-based clinical practice guidelines as an alternative to hand searching","abstract":"Background\nHeart failure is a highly debilitating syndrome with a poor prognosis primarily affecting the elderly.\n\n Clinicians wanting timely access to heart failure evidence to provide optimal patient care can face many challenges in locating this evidence.\n\n\nMethods\nA Clinical Advisory Group was established to advise study investigators.\n\n The study set of 876 relevant articles from four heart failure clinical practice guidelines was divided into three datasets: a Term Identification Set, a Filter Development Set, and a Filter Validation Set.\n\n A further validation set (the Cochrane Validation Set) was formed using studies included in Cochrane heart failure systematic reviews.\n\n Candidate search terms were identified via word frequency analysis.\n\n The filter was developed by creating combinations of terms and recording their performance in retrieving items from the Filter Development Set.\n\n The filter's recall was then validated in both the Filter Validation Set and the Cochrane Validation Set.\n\n A precision estimate was obtained post-hoc by running the filter in Medline and screening the first 200 retrievals for relevance to heart failure.\n\n\nResults\nThe four-term filter achieved a recall of 96.9% in the Filter Development Set; 98.2% in the Filter Validation Set; and 97.8% in the Cochrane Validation Set.\n\n Of the first 200 references retrieved by the filter when run in Medline, 150 were deemed relevant and 50 irrelevant.\n\n The post-hoc precision estimate was therefore 75%.\n\n\nConclusions\nThis study describes an objective method for developing a validated heart failure filter of high recall performance and then testing its precision post-hoc.\n\n Clinical practice guidelines were found to be a feasible alternative to hand searching in creating a gold standard for filter development.\n\n Guidelines may be especially appropriate given their clinical utility.\n\n A validated heart failure filter is now available to support health professionals seeking reliable and efficient access to the heart failure literature.\n\n\n","id":"PMC3037346","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"BioMed Central","authors":[{"firstname":"Raechel

palliative care literature","abstract":"Background\nIt is difficult to systematically search for literature relevant to palliative care in general medical journals.\n\n A previously developed search filter for use on OVID Medline validated using a gold standard set of references identified through hand searching, achieved an unacceptably low sensitivity (45.4%).\n\n Retrieving relevant literature is integral to support evidence based practice, and understanding the nature of the incorrectly excluded citations (false negatives) using the filter may lead to improvement in the filter's performance.\n\n\nMethods\nThe objectives were to describe the nature of subjects reflected in the false negative citations and to empirically improve the sensitivity of the search filter.\n\n A thematic analysis of MeSH terms by three independent reviewers was used to describe the subject coverage of the missed records.\n\n Using a frequency analysis of MeSH terms, those headings which could individually contribute at least 2.5% to sensitivity (occurring 19 or more times) were added to the search filter.\n\n All previously run searches were rerun at the same time as the revised filter, and results compared.\n\n\nResults\nThematic analysis of MeSH terms identified thirteen themes reflected in the missing records, none of them intrinsically palliative.\n\n The addition of six MeSH terms to the existing search filter (physician-patient relations, prognosis, quality of life, survival rate, treatment outcome and attitude to health) led to an increase in sensitivity from 46.3% to 64.7%, offset by a decrease in precision from 72.6% to 21.9%.\n\n\nConclusion\nThe filter's sensitivity was successfully increased using frequency analysis of MeSH terms, offset by a decrease in precision.\n\n A thematic analysis of MeSH terms for the false negative citations confirmed the absence of any intrinsically palliative theme or term, suggesting that future improvements to search filters for palliative care literature will first depend on better identifying how clinicians and researchers conceptualise palliative care.\n\n It is suggested that a constellation of parameters: stage of disease (advanced or active), prospect of cure (little or none), and treatment goals (primarily quality of life) may ultimately inform search strategies.\n\n This may be similarly true for chronic diseases, which share the inherent passage of time which marks them apart from acute, and therefore more readily identifiable, episodes of care.\n\n\n","id":"PMC1931586","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"BioMed Central","authors":[{"firstname":"Ruth

of empirically derived search strategies with the PubMed interface","abstract":"Background\nThe identification of health services research in databases such as PubMed/Medline is a cumbersome task.\n\n This task becomes even more difficult if the field of interest involves the use of diverse methods and data sources, as is the case with nurse staffing research.\n\n This type of research investigates the association between nurse staffing parameters and nursing and patient outcomes.\n\n A comprehensively developed search strategy may help identify nurse staffing research in PubMed/Medline.\n\n\nMethods\nA set of relevant references in PubMed/Medline was identified by means of three systematic reviews.\n\n This development set was used to detect candidate free-text and MeSH terms.\n\n The frequency of these terms was compared to a random sample from PubMed/Medline in order to identify terms specific to nurse staffing research, which were then used to develop a sensitive, precise and balanced search strategy.\n\n To determine their precision, the newly developed search strategies were tested against a) the pool of relevant references extracted from the systematic reviews, b) a reference set identified from an electronic journal screening, and c) a sample from PubMed/Medline.\n\n Finally, all newly developed strategies were compared to PubMed's Health Services Research Queries (PubMed's HSR Queries).\n\n\nResults\nThe sensitivities of the newly developed search strategies were almost 100% in all of the three test sets applied; precision ranged from 6.1% to 32.0%.\n\n PubMed's HSR queries were less sensitive (83.3% to 88.2%) than the new search strategies.\n\n Only minor differences in precision were found (5.0% to 32.0%).\n\n\nConclusions\nAs with other literature on health services research, nurse staffing studies are difficult to identify in PubMed/Medline.\n\n Depending on the purpose of the search, researchers can choose between high sensitivity and retrieval of a large number of references or high precision, i.\n\ne.\n\n and an increased risk of missing relevant references, respectively.\n\n More standardized terminology (e.\n\ng.\n\n by consistent use of the term 'nurse staffing') could improve the precision of future searches in this field.\n\n Empirically selected search terms can help to develop effective search strategies.\n\n The high consistency between all test sets confirmed the validity of our approach.\n\n\n","id":"PMC2936389","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"BioMed

Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) Statement on the Quality of Published Systematic Review and Meta-Analyses","abstract":"Introduction\nPRISMA statement was published in 2009 in order to set standards in the reporting of systematic reviews and meta-analyses.\n\n Our aim was to evaluate the impact of PRISMA endorsement on the quality of reporting and methodological quality of systematic reviews and meta-analyses, published in journals in the field of gastroenterology and hepatology (GH).\n\n\nMethods\nQuality of reporting and methodological quality were evaluated by assessing the adherence of papers to PRISMA checklist and AMSTAR quality scale.\n\n After identifying the GH journals which endorsed PRISMA in instructions for authors (IA), we appraised: 15 papers published in 2012 explicitly mentioning PRISMA in the full text (Group A); 15 papers from the same journals published in 2012 not explicitly mentioning PRISMA in the full text (Group B); 30 papers published the year preceding PRISMA endorsement from the same journals as above (Group C); 30 papers published in 2012 on the 10 highest impact factor journals in GH which not endorsed PRISMA (Group D).\n\n\nResults\nPRISMA statement was referred in the IA in 9 out of 70 GH journals (12.9%).\n\n We found significant increase in overall adherence to PRISMA checklist (Group A, 90.1%; Group C, 83.1%; p?=?0.003) and compliance to AMSTAR scale (Group A, 85.0%; Group C, 74.6%; p?=?0.002), following the PRISMA endorsement from the nine GH journals.\n\n Explicit referencing of PRISMA in manuscript was not associated with increase in quality of reporting and methodological quality (Group A vs.\n\n B, p?=?0.651, p?=?0.900, respectively).\n\n Adherence to PRISMA checklist, and the compliance with AMSTAR were significantly higher in journals endorsing PRISMA compared to those not (Groups A+B vs.\n\n D; p?=?0.003 and p?=?0.016, respectively).\n\n\nConclusion\nThe endorsement of PRISMA resulted in increase of both quality of reporting and methodological quality.\n\n It is advised that an increasing number of medical journals include PRISMA in the instructions for authors.\n\n\n","id":"PMC3873291","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Public Library of

and meta-analyses published in nursing journals: a cross-sectional study","abstract":"Objective\nSystematic reviews (SRs) often poorly report key information, thereby diminishing their usefulness.\n\n Previous studies evaluated published SRs and determined that they failed to meet explicit criteria or characteristics.\n\n The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement was recommended as a reporting guideline for SR and meta-analysis (MA), but previous studies showed that adherence to the statement was not high for SRs published in different medical fields.\n\n Thus, the aims of this study are twofold: (1) to investigate the number of nursing journals that have required or recommended the use of the PRISMA statement for reporting SR, and (2) to examine the adherence of SRs and/or meta-analyses to the PRISMA statement published in nursing journals.\n\n\nDesign\nA cross-sectional study.\n\n\nMethods\nNursing journals listed in the ISI journal citation report were divided into 2 groups based on the recommendation of PRISMA statement in their Instruction for Authors.\n\n SRs and meta-analyses published in 2014 were searched in 3 databases.\n\n 37 SRs and meta-analyses were randomly selected in each group.\n\n The adherence of each item to the PRISMA was examined and summarised using descriptive statistics.\n\n The quality of the SRs was assessed by Assessing the Methodological Quality of Systematic Reviews.\n\n The differences between the 2 groups were compared using the Mann-Whitney U test.\n\n\nResults\nOut of 107 nursing journals, 30 (28.0%) recommended or required authors to follow the PRISMA statement when they submit SRs or meta-analyses.\n\n The median rates of adherence to the PRISMA statement for reviews published in journals with and without PRISMA endorsement were 64.9% (IQR: 17.692.3%) and 73.0% (IQR: 59.594.6%), respectively.\n\n No significant difference was observed in any of the items between the 2 groups.\n\n\nConclusions\nThe median adherence of SRs and meta-analyses in nursing journals to PRISMA is low at 64.9% and 73.0%, respectively.\n\n Nonetheless, the adherence level of nursing journals to the PRISMA statement does not significantly vary whether they endorse or recommend such a guideline.\n\n\n","id":"PMC5306529","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"BMJ Publishing

QUOROM to PRISMA: A Survey of High-Impact Medical Journals' Instructions to Authors and a Review of Systematic Reviews in Anesthesia Literature","abstract":"Background\nThe PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items of Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses) Statement was published to help authors improve how they report systematic reviews.\n\n It is unknown how many journals mention PRISMA in their instructions to authors, or whether stronger journal language regarding use of PRISMA improves author compliance.\n\n\nMethodology/Principal Findings\nAn Internet-based investigation examined the extent to which 146 leading medical journals have incorporated the PRISMA Statement into their instructions to authors.\n\n Results were analyzed using descriptive statistics.\n\n Also, systematic reviews published in the leading anesthesiology journals and the QUOROM (QUality Of Reporting Of Meta-analyses) Statement were used to explore the hypothesis that indicating compliance with the QUOROM Statement in the manuscript is associated with improved compliance with the reporting guideline.\n\n In a sample of 146 journals publishing systematic reviews, the PRISMA Statement was referred to in the instructions to authors for 27% (40/146) of journals; more often in general and internal medicine journals (7/14; 50%) than in specialty medicine journals (33/132; 25%).\n\n In the second part of the study, 13 systematic reviews published in the leading anesthesiology journals in 2008 were included for appraisal.\n\n Mention of the QUOROM Statement in the manuscript was associated with higher compliance with the QUOROM checklist (P?=?0.022).\n\n\nConclusions/Significance\nMost of the leading medical journals used ambiguous language regarding what was expected of authors.\n\n Further improvement on quality of reporting of systematic reviews may entail journals clearly informing authors of their requirements.\n\n Stronger directions, such as requiring an indication of adherence to a research quality of reporting statement in the manuscript, may improve reporting and utility of systematic reviews.\n\n\n","id":"PMC3217994","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Public

Future trials need to use up-to-date and validated instruments to measure stigma and discrimination.\nIntroduction\nIn the last three decades, the HIV/AIDS epidemic has been one of the most challenging public health problems in the world. Out of the 36.9 million people living with HIV (PLHIV) globally in 2017, only 75% of them knew their HIV positive status. Out of these, only 21.7 million were accessing HIV treatment in 2017. Currently, there is a global commitment to end the HIV/AIDS epidemic by 2030. As a roadmap to end the epidemic (as a public health threat) by the year 2030, the United Nations Joint Program of HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) has set ambitious targets to be achieved by 2020. These targets include making sure 90% of all PLHIV know their sero-status, 90% of those who know their sero-status are receiving treatment, and 90% of PLHIV on treatment having suppressed viral loads. If these targets are to be achieved, the stumbling blocks of stigma and discrimination (SAD) need to be addressed.\nAlthough healthcare workers (HCWs) are expected to be a source of comfort, support, and encouragement, it has been documented that they also sometimes stigmatize PLHIV. In healthcare settings, SAD are often manifested in the form of negligence, breaches of confidentiality, gossip, excessive or differential precautions, poor support, delay or denial of treatment, differential treatment, and unnecessary referrals based on the patient's sero-status. Therefore, some PLHIV are not getting the needed support because of either low healthcare seeking behavior due to fear of stigma, or because of negligence by HCWs. Consequently, HIV-related SAD compromise access to treatment and support programs among PLHIV. Stigma and discrimination are also associated with poor physical and mental health outcomes, low social support, and reduced income for HIV positive people. As a result, SAD have been contributing to the continued transmission of HIV and its negative impacts.\nAlthough there are reviews that addressed interventions targeting HIV-related SAD, some of them did not report the findings specifically within different population sub-groups (healthcare workers, PLHIV, community members, etc.) and settings (community, healthcare settings, schools, etc.). The effectiveness of these interventions might have been affected by contextual factors such as the setting (whether the setting is in a healthcare institution or in the community), the policy environment, and other enabling factors present in that setting. These factors were not specified by previous reviews. Though SAD in healthcare settings are presumed to be similar across geographical bounderies, the manifestations of stigma in healthcare settings differs from other contexts, such as schools, community and faith based organizations.\nIn healthcare settings, both structural and individual-level factors fuel HIV-related SAD. Individual-level factors that affect the practice of HCWs include fear of casual transmission, and limited knowledge of what stigma is and its negative consequences. Structural factors include shortage of protective equipment, the absence of a redressal system for managing SAD by HCWs, and the asbsence of a supportive policy or presence of a discriminatory policy environment in the healthcare facility. Stigmatizing interactions are also often not recognized by healthcare providers as being stigmatizing. For instance, visibly marking the files of PLHIV is taken as an appropriate practice by some HCWs. The above factors should be addressed through skills building and structural interventions such as availing supplies for standard precautions and establishing non-discrminatory policies and regulations in healthcare facilities. Evidence on the effectiveness and the details of these interventions should be assessed and pooled.\nThrough a preliminary search in PubMed, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health (CINAHL), Excerpta Medica Database from Elsevier (EMBASE) and Cochrane Library, we found no systematic review addressing stigma and discrimination reduction interventions specific to healthcare settings or HCWs published within the last three years. Therefore, the aim of this review was to identify, appraise and analyze findings of studies reporting on interventions aimed to reduce HIV-related stigma and discrimination among HCWs in healthcare facilities.\nReview questions/objectives\nThis review sought to locate, appraise and describe international literature reporting on interventions that addressed HIV-related stigma and discrimination among healthcare workers and in healthcare institutions.\nSpecifically, the review aimed to:\nIdentify, appraise and describe studies containing interventions to reduce HIV-related SAD by HCWs.\nIdentify, appraise and describe studies that report on institutional-level interventions to reduce HIV-related SAD.\nMethods and participants\nThis systematic review was prepared using PRISMA reporting guidelines (S1 Table) for systematic reviews. The review was conducted in accordance with the Joanna Briggs Institute methodology for systematic reviews of effectiveness evidence and an a-priori protocol registered in PROSPERO 2017 CRD42017071799 (available from http://www.crd.york.ac.uk/PROSPERO/display_record.php?ID=CRD42017071799). During the conduct of the review, we considered the following inclusion criteria.\nPopulation\nThis review considered interventions addressing HCWs in healthcare institutions (clinics, health centers, and hospitals). The current review was limited to the context of healthcare institutions; it did not include interventions that were aimed to address SAD in any other locations. We aimed to include not only interventions addressing knowledge gaps of healthcare workers, but also institutional factors contributing to stigma. Some studies that addressed interventions for students, were either a mixture of medical and non-medical students (medical, paramedical and non-health related fields), had only a short-term follow up, or did not address contextual factors within healthcare institutions, such as institutional policies and guidelines, and the presence of materials and supplies. Moreover, the level of training of students in the health sciences discipline is not uniform in the studies conducted so far. Additionally, HIV services are so sensitive; they most often are handled by permanent staff rather than students, who participate in service only temporarily. Taking these factors into account, we considered only in-service healthcare professionals (those professionals engaged in care provision after graduation) for inclusion.\nInterventions\nInterventions that addressed HIV-related SAD by health workers were considered.\nThese included, but were not limited to the following:\nInformation-based approaches including both written and verbal information to increase the understanding of HIV and stigma, provided in the form of leaflets and brochures or through other methods.\nSkills building approach, such as demonstrations and role-plays.\nStructural approaches, such as availing supplies for standard precautions, revision and development of standard operating procedures, polices and regulations, and putting a system in place for addressing grievances.\nContact strategies, such as testimonials of PLHIV and activities that encourage interaction between HCWs and PLHIV.\nBiomedical interventions, such as universal access to care and treatment or expansion of HIV counseling and testing (HCT).\nCounseling and support interventions to help cope with HIV-related stigma and discrimination, specifically secondary stigma (stigma that they may face because of their association with PLHIV). Studies indicate that HCWs themselves face secondary stigma as a result of their association with PLHIV. It was also shown that HCWs living with HIV faced perceived or actual SAD from colleagues or the community.\nComparators\nThe comparators considered were baseline (before intervention), no intervention, usual care and one or more of the above components compared to one another.\nOutcomes\nThe primary outcomes considered for inclusion were HIV-related stigma and discrimination by HCWs in healthcare institutions. Forms of stigma included fear-based stigma, value-based stigma, enacted stigma, internalized stigma, or stigma in other forms. Internalized stigma is defined as the acceptance or internalization of shame, blame, hopelessness, guilt, and fear of discrimination associated with being HIV-positive.\nHIV-related SAD can be categorized into four domains: drivers, facilitators, manifestations, and intersecting stigma. Drivers are individual level factors that influence the occurrence of stigma. These include lack of adequate knowledge, fear of infection, or prejudicial attitude towards PLHIV or key population groups. Facilitators are organizational or societal level factors that influence stigma. These may include the presence or absence of protective or punitive laws, redress systems, or support systems. Manifestations are the immediate consequences of stigma such as discrimination (experiencing stigma), anticipated stigma, or perceived stigma. Layered or intersecting stigma is the co-occurrence of stigma related to HIV status, gender, profession, poverty or sexual orientation. Studies that used single or separate items and that did not create composite scales of measurement for attitudinal items of stigma were excluded from the review. The secondary outcomes considered were PLHIV-specific extra-precaution (excessive use of precautions or over-use protective barriers selectively when handling PLHIV) and adherence to universal precautions). We considered both dichotomous measures and continuous scale measures for this outcome.\nContext\nThis review considered all studies conducted worldwide in healthcare settings (hospitals, clinics or health centers).\nTypes of studies\nThis review considered all studies with comparative designs, such as randomized controlled trials (RCTs), quasi-experimental studies and, before and after studies.\nSearch strategy\nThe search strategy aimed to find both published and unpublished studies reported in English. A three-step search strategy was utilized in this review. An initial limited search of Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health (CINAHL) and PubMed was undertaken, followed by an examination of the text words contained in the title and abstract, and of the index terms used to describe the article. A second search using all identified keywords and index terms was then undertaken across all included databases. Thirdly, the reference list of all identified reports and articles was searched for additional studies.\nBoth published and unpublished papers reported in the English were searched with no restriction to age of the participants, country and date of publication. The databases searched were: CINAHL, Excerpta Medica Database from Elsevier (EMBASE), PubMed and Psychological information (PsycINFO) database. The search for unpublished studies included: HIVinSite, AIDSinfo, HIV and AIDS clearinghouse, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) HIV publications, Health Policy Project (HPP) website, United States Agency for International Development (USAID) experience clearinghouse, and United Nations Joint Program on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) publications. A detailed search strategy for each database is reported in S2 Table.\nStudy selection\nFollowing the above search procedure, all identified citations were loaded into EndNote and duplicates were removed. Titles and abstracts were screened by two independent reviewers for assessment against the inclusion criteria for the review. The full texts of potentially eligible studies were retrieved and assessed in detail against the inclusion criteria by two independent reviewers.\nAssessment of methodological quality\nTwo individuals (GTF and MS (non-author)) independently appraised the quality of the eligible studies prior to inclusion in the review using appraisal instruments from the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) for experimental, quasi-experimental studies, and other comparative study designs (S1 Document). After appraisal, studies that did not meet the methodological criteria were excluded and reasons for their exclusion are provided in S2 Document. All disagreements that arose between the reviewers were resolved through discussion, and there was no requirement for a third reviewer.\nData extraction and syntheses\nQuantitative data were extracted from papers included in the review using the standardized data extraction tool from the JBI (S3 Document). Relevant information such as population characteristics, publication year, authors, intervention type and summary of the findings were extracted. Where necessary, primary authors were asked to provide additional information on the articles. Details of data from primary studies with limited data or with limited follow up were checked through request to the authors and through checking subsequent publications from the same project, based on cross-checking the linked publications from the registries of trials (if trial registry number existed). For instance, Li et al. 2013 published another article from the same project in 2015.\nEffect measures reported in the form of mean difference and standard deviation (for continous variables) and relative risk, odds ratio and their confidence intervals (for dichotomous variables) were extracted and reported. Since the studies were methodologically or clinically heterogeneous, statistical pooling was not possible; hence, the findings are presented in narrative form. The quality of evidence for major outcomes reported in each study was assessed using a software package developed by the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) working group.\nResults\nThe search yielded a total of 2,927 records. After removing, duplicates, 2,856 documents were retained for further examination. After screening the titles and abstracts, 167 records were retained for full text examination. Based on pre-defined inclusion criteria, 30 records were included for critical appraisal. Finally, 14 records reporting on eight studies were retained (Fig 1). Sixteen studies were excluded based on reason. Almost all studies excluded based on reason had significant measurement bias.\nStudy selection process.\nFrom: Moher D, Liberati A, Tetzlaff J, Altman DG, The PRISMA Group (2009).

PLoS Med 6(7): e1000097. doi:10.1371/journal.pmed1000097.\nDescription of the characteristics of included studies\nAmong the 14 records included in this review, six articles (Li et al. 2013a; Li et al. 2013b; Li et al. 2013c; Li et al. 2014a; Li et al. 2014b; and Li et al. 2015) reported on the findings of a single randomized trial. The trial was conducted in 40 hospitals of China. Hereafter, Li et al. 2015 will be used to describe the findings extracted from the study, although data were extracted from all the six articles to get complete information. In addition, another before-and-after study (Williams et al. 2006) was conducted in China. The other studies were conducted in Chile (Norr et al. 2012); India (Mahendra et al. 2006);Vietnam (Pulewitz et al. 2015 and Oahn et al. 2008); Egypt (Lohiniva et al. 2016); USA (Zachary 1998) and one study was a multi-country case study (Uys et al. 2009). Pulewitz et al. 2015 and Oahn et al. 2008 both reported on the same study. For reporting purpose, hereafter, we will use Pulewitz et al. 2015. The characteristics of the included studies are shown in Table 1.\nStudy characteristics.\nStudy ID	Study location	Category of intervention	Type of intervention versus comparison	Participants	Follow up duration	Level of implementation	Domain of stigma	Outcomes	 	Li et al. 2015 	China	Information-based, skills building and structural	Identifying and training POL through group discussion, games, and role-plays versus usual care (supplies provided for both arms)	1740 (880 control and 880 intervention) HCWs from 40 hospitals	12 months	Organizational, individual	Driver, facilitator	Prejudicial attitude, avoidance intent, adherence to universal precaution, and institutional support	 	Lohiniva et al. 2016 	Egypt	Information-based, skills building and contact	Interactive training and discussion focusing on HIV-related stigma, infection control and medical ethics combined with contact with PLHIV (5 modules)	347 (203 intervention and 144 control) HCWs from 2 hospitals	4 months	Individual	Driver	Value-based stigma, fear-based stigma	 	Norr et al. 2012 	Chile	Information-based	8 sessions of professionally-assisted peer group intervention	555 (293 control and 262 intervention) HCWs from 5 clinics	3 months	Individual	Driver	Public contact stigma, client contact stigma, blame	 	Mahendra et al. 2006 	India	Information-based, skills building, structural, contact and biomedical approach	Participatory self-guided assessment and intervention with training, development and dissemination of guidelines and educational materials on infection control	884 HCWs in pre-test and 885 HCWs post-test from 3 hospitals	6-months	Organizational, individual	Driver, facilitator, manifestation	Stigmatizing beliefs and practices	 	Pulewitz et al. 2015 	Vietnam	Information-based, skills building, structural and contact	Arm 1: 1-day workshop and 1.5-day training on HIV/AIDS basic knowledge and universal precautionArm 2: SAD in addition to interventions in Arm 1	795 HCWs at baseline and 797 HCWs at end line	6 months	Organizational, individual	Driver, facilitator, manifestation	Fear-based stigma, social stigma, enacted stigma	 	Williams et al. 2006 	China	Information-based, skills building	A 5-day workshop comprising didactic lectures	180 nurses at baseline and 180 nurses post intervention	5 days	Individual	Driver	AIDS attitude, willingness to carry out nursing activities for PLHIV	 	Uys et al. 2009 	Lesotho, Malawi, South Africa, Swaziland, and Tanzania	Information-based, skills building, and contact	A 2-day workshop bringing PLHIV and nurses together	43 nurses and 41 PLHIV	1 month	Organizational, individual	Driver, manifestation	stigma, self-efficacy and self-esteem	 	Zachary 1998 	USA	Information-based	A 1-hour group education on homophobia and fear of death	35 nurses in one medical Centre	Only post intervention data (No follow up)	Individual	Driver	AIDS phobia, homophobia	 	\nNB: POL: Popular opinion leaders, HCWs: Healthcare workers, SAD: Stigma and discrimination,HIV: Human immunodeficiency virus, PLHIV: People Living with HIV, USA: United States of America, AIDS: Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome.\nMethodological quality of individual studies\nSix articles (Li et al. 2013a; Li et al. 2013b; Li et al. 2013c; Li et al 2014a; Li et al. 2014b and Li et al. 2015) reported on the findings of a single randomized controlled trial. None of the included articles clearly described the method of randomization and allocation concealment. Three studies (Norr et al. 2012; Lohiniva et al. 2016 and Pulewitz et al. 2015) were non-randomized trials with control groups. Two before and after trials without control groups (Williams et al. 2006 and Zachary 1998) had post intervention data taken from the same cohort of participants as those of baseline participants. One study (Uys et al. 2009) was a multiple-case study design reporting on the same cohort of nurses and PLHIV before and after the intervention. One before and after study without a control group (Mahendra et al. 2006) reported on independent cross-sectional samples from the same institution. The study did not identify and control for confounding factors.\nParticipant blinding is not practical for such behavioral interventions. Hence, none of the studies described blinding of participants or assessors, and outcome concealment. Five of the studies (Li et al 2015; Lohiniva et al. 2015; Pulewitz et al. 2015; Norr et al. 2012 and Zachariah 1998) used self-administered questionnaires. Five studies (Lohiniva et al 2016; Williams et al. 2006; Pulewitz et al. 2015; Mahendra et al. 2006 and Uys et al. 2009) were judged to have unclear or a high risk of bias on outcome assessment, because either there was significant loss to follow up or inadequate information (Lohiniva et al. 2016 and Williams et al. 2006), or they used repeated cross-sectional samples with different samples (Mahendra et al. 2006), or there was a considerable proportion of participants with incomplete data who were excluded from analyses (Pulewitz et al. 2015). Overall, the included RCT (Li et al. 2015) scored 8/13 using the scoring method for measuring the methodological qualitieas of RCTs (Table 2). One of the quasi-experimental studies (Norr et al. 2012) scored 9/13. Four quasi-experimental studies studies ((Lohiniva et al. 2016; Williams et al. 2006 and Pulewitz et al. 2015) scored 8/9 (Table 3). One repeated cross-sectional study (Mahendra et al. 2006) scored 6/8 (Table 4). The multiple case study (Uys et al. 2009) was given a score of 8/10 (Table 5).\nMethodological quality of randomized controlled trails.\nStudy ID	Q1	Q2	Q3	Q4	Q5	Q6	Q7	Q8	Q9	Q10	Q11	Q12	Q13	Total of 'yes' scores	 	Li et al. 2015 	U	U	Y	U	U	U	Y	Y	Y	Y	Y	Y	Y	8	 	\nNB: Y = Yes, U = unclear, NA = not applicable\nQ1.

Most studies utilized more than one of the above general categories of interventions. One study (Mahendra et al 2006) used all of the five categories of interventions in combination. One study (Pulewitz et al. 2015) utilized a combination of information-based, skills building, structural and contact approaches. Two studies (Uys et al. 2009 and Lohiniva et al. 2016) used a combination of information-based, skills building, and contact approaches. One study (Li et al. 2015) utilized a combination of information-based, skills building and structural approaches. One study (Williams et al. 2006) utilized a combination of information-based and skills building approaches. The remaining two studies (Norr et al. 2012 and Zachary 1998) utilized only information-based intervention.\nSince the design, duration of follow-up, and instruments used to measure the effect of the interventions were not uniform across the included studies, we could not compare one type of intervention with another, nor multiple interventions with a single intervention. We also could not pool the findings of the studies using meta-analysis. Nevertheless, we present the findings of the studies along with their respective quality of evidence. The details of the intervention and their effects are described in detail below.\nTraining popular opinion leaders\nThe study by Li et al. identified and trained popular opinion leaders (POLs) through group discussions, games, and role-plays. The POLs attended a 1.5-hour weekly group training session run for four weeks and fortnightly re-union sessions. Materials for universal precaution were supplied in both control and intervention hospitals. The authors collected data from 880 HCWs from 20 intervention hospitals (where POLs were trained) and from another 880 HCWs from 20 control hospitals.\nHCWs' avoidance intent was measured using a five-point Likert-scale which assessed HCWs' willingness to treat PLHIV in eight scenarios. Higher scores indicated a higher intent to avoid service provision to PLHIV. The intervention effect on avoidance intent was sustained even at 12 months follow up. At 12 months follow up, avoidance intent among HCWs in the intervention hospitals was significantly lower (mean difference (MD) = -1.87 [95% CI -2.05 to -1.69]) when compared to that of healthcare workers in control hospitals (P&lt;0.01). Prejudicial attitude was measured using eight items rated on the five-point Likert scale, however, only effect estimate was reported. At 12 months follow up, the prejudicial attitude among healthcare workers in the intervention hospitals was significantly lower (MD = -3.77 [95% CI -5.4 to -2.09]) when compared to that of HCWs in control hospitals (P&lt;0.01). Universal precaution (UP) compliance was measured using 13 items with responses ranging from 0 (never) to 4 (always) on a Likert scale. Higher scores indicate higher levels of adherence to UP. Universal precaution compliance was significantly higher among HCWs in the intervention group (MD = 1.65 [95% CI 1.41 to 1.89]) when compared to HCWs assigned to usual care (P&lt;0.01) [moderate quality of evidence].\nModular interactive training and discussion\nThe study by Lohiniva et al. assessed the effect of an interactive training and discussion intervention focusing on HIV-related stigma, infection control, and medical ethics using five modules. The intervention was complemented by interaction with PLHIV. The authors assessed the effect of the training by collecting pre-intervention and post-intervention data from the same cohort of participants. They used nine items to measure value-based stigma. Twelve items were used to measure fear-based stigma. Both scales were standardized to obtain scores ranging from 1 to 10. For both scales higher scores indicated higher levels of stigma. At the post-intervention survey, the participants from the experimental group reported significantly lower levels of value-based stigma (mean = 2.1) when compared to participants in the control group (mean = 3.8) (MD = -1.7, P&lt;0.01, CI was not given). Similarly, fear-based stigma was significantly lower among participants in the experimental group (mean = 1.1) when compared to that of participants in the control group (mean = 3.2) (MD = -2.1, P&lt;0.01, CI was not given) [very low quality evidence].\nProfessionally-assisted peer group intervention\nThe study by Norr et al. assessed eight sessions of professionally-assisted peer group interventions. The sessions covered (a) the importance of community HIV prevention; (b) standard precautions in the healthcare setting; (c) HIV testing and treatment; (d) offering care that respects human dignity and confidentiality; (e) human sexuality, sexual transmission of HIV and other sexually transmitted infections (STIs), and HIV transmission through drug use and blood; (f) partner communication and HIV prevention;(g) counselling about HIV infection; and (h) HIV prevention to clients and families using role plays.\nTo assess the effect of the intervention, pre-and post-intervention measurements were made for both control and intervention groups. Public contact stigma was measured using three items on a four-point Likert scale. Since mean item scores (instead of the mean scale score) were reported, possible scores ranged from 1 to 4. Client contact stigma was measured using three items on a three-point Likert scale. Again, mean item scores were reported, so possible scores ranged from 1 to 3. For both scales, higher scores indicated a higher level of stigma. After the intervention, the level of client contact stigma among participants in the intervention group was significantly lower [MD = -0.28 (95% CI -0.37 to -0.19)] (P&lt;0.01) [very low quality of evidence]. Similarly, public contact stigma among the intervention group was significantly lower (MD = -0.07 (95% CI -0.12 to -0.02) (P&lt;0.01) [very low quality of evidence].\nStaff training, participatory hospital policy development, provision of materials and supplies, and expansion of HCT services\nUnder this group of interventions, there are two subtypes of interventions reported in the studies included in this review:\na. Participatory self-guided assessment and intervention with training and the development and dissemination of policy guidelines and educational materials. The study by Mahendra et al. conducted a participatory self-guided assessment and intervention with interactive training facilitated by representatives of AIDS service organizations (including PLHIV), which involved the development and dissemination of policy guidelines and educational materials, such as posters on infection control and expansion and strengthening of HIV counseling and testing (HCT) in three hospitals. The effect of the intervention was measured using an index score of stigma that could range from a minimum of 21 to a maximum of 63, a higher score indicating greater level of stigma. They assessed the effect of the intervention using repeated cross-sectional surveys. After the intervention, there was a significant decrease in stigma score from 42.79 at baseline to 38.08 after the intervention (MD = -4.72, CI not given, P&lt;0.01) [very low quality evidence].\nIn addition, the probability of seeking informed consent to test for HIV was 2.14 (95% CI 1.17 to 3.91) times higher after the intervention when compared to the likelihood before the intervention (P&lt;0.01) [very low quality evidence]. The likelihood of using gloves after the intervention was 7.81 (95% CI 3.64 to 16.76) times higher after the intervention when compared to the likelihood before the intervention (P&lt;0.01) [very low quality evidence].\nb. Staff training, participatory hospital policy development and provision of material supplies. The study by Pulewitz et al. compared the effect of addressing fear-based stigma alone (arm 1) to that of addressing both fear-based stigma and social stigma (stemming from moral judgments) (arm 2) through interventions that encompassed staff training, participatory hospital policy development and provision of materials and supplies. Healthcare workers in arm 1 received interventions that addressed only fear-based stigma. The interventions included a half-day training on basic knowledge of HIV/AIDS and a one-day training on universal precaution. Healthcare workers in arm 2 received interventions that addressed both fear-based stigma and social stigma. The training for arm 2 participants encompassed basic knowledge of HIV, universal precaution and stigma. The authors reported that both interventions had significantly reduced stigma.\nThe authors measured fear-based stigma using four items with alternative responses ranging from 1 (no fear) to 3 (a lot of fear). Hence, the composite score ranged from 4 to 12. Social stigma was measured using five items, each having a score range of 1 to 3. The composite score ranged from 5 to 15. In both scales, higher scores indicated a higher level of stigma.\nAfter the intervention, HCWs exposed to interventions that addressed both fear-based stigma and social stigma had significantly lower scores (MD = -0.37, 95% CI -0.54 to -0.21) of fear-based stigma when compared to those HCWs exposed to interventions that addressed only fear-based stigma (P&lt;0.01) [Very low quality evidence]. On the other hand, there was no statistically significant difference in social stigma (MD = -0.14, 95% CI -0.43 to 0.15) between the two intervention groups [very low quality evidence].\nThe odds of over-using protective barriers was 46% (OR 0.54 (95% CI 0.31 to 0.91) lower among HCWs exposed to interventions addressing both fear-based and social stigma when compared to those of HCWs exposed to intervention that addressed fear-based stigma alone (P&lt;0.01) [Very low quality evidence]. The odds of marking files of HIV positive clients was 46% (OR 0.54 (95% CI 0.29 to 1) lower among HCWs exposed to interventions addressing both fear-based and social stigma when compared to those of HCWs exposed to interventions that addressed fear-based stigma alone (P&lt;0.01) [very low quality evidence]. The odds of putting signs on a patients bed indicating HIV status was 75% (OR 0.25 (95% CI 0.07 to 0.87)) lower among HCWs exposed to interventions addressing both fear-based and social stigma when compared to those of HCWs exposed to interventions that addressed fear-based stigma alone (P&lt;0.01) [very low quality evidence].\nMultifaceted educational programs comprising didactic lectures and activities eliciting discussions\nThe study by Williams et al. investigated a five-day workshop for HCWs comprising didactic lectures on HIV/AIDS epidemiology, natural history, transmission routes and clinical care combined with activities that provoked discussion of participants' values and personal feelings about HIV/AIDS. To measure the effect of the intervention, both empathy and avoidance attitude scores ranged from 1 to 6. Higher scores in empathy and lower scores in avoidance attitude indicated a more desirable attitude. General attitude score was calculated by substracting the avoidance score from the empathy score. It ranged from -5 to 5. Positive general attitude scores suggested a supportive attitude, while negative scores suggested a negative attitude. The nurses' willingness questionnaire (NWQ) was used to measure the willingness of nurses to perform activities on HIV-positive patients. The questionnaire was composed of 13 items measured on an 11-point Likert scale ranging from 0 (not all willing) to 10 (extremely willing). Hence the total possible scores ranged from 0 to 130.\nThe intervention resulted in significant improvement in empathy (MD = 0.2 (CI not given, P&lt;0.01); reduction in avoidance attitude (MD = -0.4, CI not given, P&lt;0.01), improvement in general attitude towards PLHIV (MD = 0.6, CI not given, P&lt;0.01), and willingness to care for PLHIV (MD = 13, CI not given, P&lt;0.01) [Very low quality of evidence].\nContact strategy: Workshops bringing PLHIV and Healthcare workers together\nThe multi-country case study by Uys et al. assessed the impact of a two-day workshop that brought PLHIV and nurses together. The authors measured self-esteem using Rosenberg's self-esteem scale, which consists of ten items rated on a four-point Likert scale. Scores could range from 10 to 40. Stigma experienced by PLHIV was measured using 33 items. It had six domains: verbal abuse, negative self-perception, healthcare neglect, social isolation, fear of contagion and workplace stigma. An HIV/AIDS stigma instrument that contained 19 items was used to measure stigmatizing attitudes among nurses. The authors reported stigma items in mean scores, but did not indicate the possible ranges for mean scores.\nAfter the intervention, there was a significant increase in self-esteem (MD = 2.12 (95% CI 0.18 to 4.06)) (P&lt;0.05), while there was a decrease in experience of workplace stigma [MD = -0.31 (95% CI -0.61 to -0.01)) (P&lt;0.05), total stigma score (MD = -0.17 (95% CI -0.35 to -0.01)) (P&lt;0.01), and negative self-perception (MD = -0.46 (95% CI -0.81 to -0.11)) (P&lt;0.01) among PLHIV [Very low quality evidence]. On the other hand, there was no significant effect observed on PLHIV's experience of verbal abuse (P = 0.38), healthcare neglect (P = 0.24), social isolation (P = 0.51) and fear of contagion (P = 0.29). Similarly, there was no significant change in nurses' stigmatizing attitudes after the intervention (MD = 0.07 (95% CI -0.04 to 0.18)) (P = 0.37) [very low quality evidence].\nGroup education on homophobia and fear of death\nThe study by Zachary used group education on AIDS phobia, homophobia and fear of death. The study measured AIDS phobia using 15 items rated on a five-point Likert scale. Hence, the score could range from 15 to 75. The intervention did not result in a significant reduction in AIDS phobia (MD = 0.03 (-3.13 to 3.19) (P = 0.94) [Very low quality evidence].\nThe Summary of Findings (SoF) for all outcomes extracted from all studies are presented in a single table (Table 6).\nSummary of Findings.\nOutcomes	Illustrative comparative risks (95% CI)	Relative effect(95% CI)	No of Participants(studies)	Quality of the evidence(GRADE)	 	Assumed risk	Corresponding risk	 		Control	Training popular opinion leaders				 	Avoidance intentScale from: 8 to 40.Follow-up: mean 12 months	The mean avoidance intent in the control groups was18.65	The mean avoidance intent in the intervention groups was 1.87 lower (2.05 to 1.69 lower)		1760(1 study)	    moderate1	 	Prejudicial attitudeScale from 8 to 40Follow-up: mean 12 months	The mean prejudicial attitude in the control groups was not given	The mean prejudicial attitude in the intervention groups was3.77 lower (5.4 to 2.09 lower)		1760(1 study)	    moderate2	 	Universal precaution complianceScale from: 0 to 52.Follow-up: mean 12 months	The mean UP compliance in the control groups was 32.88	The mean UP compliance in the intervention groups was 1.65 higher (1.42 to 1.89 higher)		1760(1 study)	    moderate1,2	 		Control	Peer education of HCWs				 	Public Contact stigmaScale from: 1 to 3	The mean public contact stigma in the control groups was 1.11	The mean blame in the intervention groups was 0.07 lower (0.12 to 0.02 lower)		927(1 study)	    very low3	 	Client contact stigma Scale from: 1 to 4Follow-up: mean 12 months	The mean client contact stigma in the control groups was 1.81	The mean contact stigma in the intervention groups was 0.28 lower (0.37 lower to 0.19 lower)		927(1 study)	    very low3,4	 		Control	Interactive training and discussion focusing on HIV-related stigma, infection control and medical ethics and contact with PLHIV				 	Fear-based stigmaScale from: 1 to 10Follow-up: mean 3 months	The mean fear-based stigma in the control groups was 3.2	The mean fear-based stigma in the intervention groups was 2.1 lower(CI not given, P&lt;0.01)		347(1 study)	    very low5,6	 	Value-based stigmaScale from: 1 to 10Follow-up: mean 3 months	The mean value-based stigma in the control groups was 3.8	The mean value-based stigma in the intervention groups was 1.7 lower (CI not given, P&lt;0.01)		347(1 study)	    very low5	 		Control	Participatory self-guided assessment and intervention				 	Stigma index Scale from 21 to 63Follow-up: mean 6 months	The mean stigma index (attitude towards PLHIV and healthcare-related practices) in the control groups was 42.79	The mean stigma index (attitude towards PLHIV and healthcare related practices) in the intervention groups was 4.72 lower (CI not given, p&lt;0.01)		1769(1 study)	    very low7,8	 	Use of glove when drawing blood if sero-status is unknownFollow-up: mean 6 months	Study population	RR 7.81 (3.64 to 16.76)	269(1 study)	    very low7,8	 	642 per 1000	1000 per 1000(1000 to 1000)	 	Sought informed consent before HIV testFollow-up: mean 6 months	Study population	RR 2.14 (1.17 to 3.91)	177(1 study)	    very low7,8	 	403 per 1000	862 per 1000(471 to 1000)	 	Addressing both fear-based and social stigma (stemming from moral judgments).

Studies included in this review employed different measures, intervention types and durations of intervention. Hence, we could not pool the results of the primary studies using meta-analysis.\nPrevious reviews categorized SAD reduction interventions into the following categories: information-based, structural, biomedical, counseling and support, skills building and contact. Most studies included in this review used a combination of two or more interventions to reduce stigma and discrimination in healthcare settings. Information-based approaches used in the studies included in the current review were:\nTraining popular opinion leaders through group discussions, games, and role-plays.\nProfessionally-assisted peer group intervention.\nGroup education on fear of death and homophobia.\nInteractive modular training and discussion focusing on HIV-related stigma, infection control, medical ethics and contact with PLHIV.\nWorkshops, training and dissemination of policy guidelines and educational materials, such as posters on infection control.\nThese information-based approaches were used alone or in combination with others. Among the combinations were: information-based approaches combined with skills building and structural approaches; information-based approaches combined with skills building and contact-based approaches; information-based approaches combined with skills building, structural, contact and biomedical approaches; information-based approaches combined with skills building, structural and contact-based approaches; and information-based with skills building approaches.\nAlthough some results reached statistical significance, because of the poor design of the studies, most of the interventions were assigned low or very low quality evidence scores after applying the GRADE approach for assessing methodological quality. Only outcomes reported in one intervention (identifying and training popular opinion leaders, in the presence of adequate supplies) was assigned a moderate quality evidence. This intervention was reported by Li et al. 2015. The study used both an information-based and structural approach to reduce SAD. The intervention employed diffusion of innovation theory to disseminate information to correct misconceptions related to PLHIV. The intervention was effective in reducing avoidance intent and prejudicial attitudes and in improving compliance to universal precaution. This indicates that structural interventions (availing materials for standard precaution) alone are insufficient, which highlights the necessity of complementing structural interventions with behavioral interventions.\nAs reported in one study, interventions addressing fear-based stigma reduction through training on basic knowledge of HIV and universal precautions were effective in reducing both social stigma and fear-based stigma. However, the study showed that the effect of the interventions that addressed both fear-based and social stigma was significantly higher in reducing fear-based stigma and extra precaution when compared to interventions addressing fear-based stigma alone. This implies that behavioral interventions targeting stigma and discrimination among healthcare providers should address prejudices and social stigma that may also be part of wider cultural beliefs, in addition to addressing fear-based stigma. Apart from equipping healthcare providers with knowledge and skills, it is paramount to address their emotions.\nThe outcomes reported by all other interventions were assigned very low quality evidence. These interventions included modular interactive training and education on HIV/AIDS, professionally-assisted peer group interventions, participatory self-guided assessment and interventions, workshops that included didactic lectures, and contact-based strategies combined with information provision. All of these interventions resulted in statistically significant reductions in stigma scores. However, a study that used group education on homophobia reported no significant change on AIDS phobia after the intervention. While the improvements observed in most interventions were statistically significant, the design of the studies included in this review were poor. The poor quality of the evidence supporting most of the findings underscores that more rigorous studies such as RCTs are needed to make appropriate decisions for policy and practice.\nThis review identified five categories of stigma and discrimination reduction interventions: information-based, skills building, structural, contact and biomedical interventions. Unlike other previous reviews, in this review we did not identify any study conducted among HCWs reporting on the impact of counseling and support approaches to SAD reduction. This may be because, unlike other population groups, HCWs were not provided counseling and support interventions to cope with secondary stigma (stigma that they may face because of their association with PLHIV).\nOn the other hand, previous studies indicate that HCWs themselves face secondary stigma as a result of their association with PLHIV. Previous studies also showed that HCWs living with HIV face perceived or actual SAD from colleagues or the community. Those studies demonstrated that counseling and support interventions helped to minimize the negative psychosocial impact of HIV-related SAD on clients living with HIV and their families. Therefore, the role of counseling and support interventions to reduce internalized or secondary stigma among HCWs should be further investigated.\nAfter we completed this review one meta-analysis and systematic review was published. The study indicated that stigma and discrimination reduction programs resulted in small effect sizes in the improvement of attitudes towards PLHIV. Nevertheless, the subgroup analysis indicated that effect sizes were moderated by the settings in which the intervention was conducted, population type and number of intervention sessions. The review had a limitation in that it was not focused enough with regard to settings, intervention type and population type. Other previous reviews on HIV-related SAD did not provide a focused summary of SAD reduction interventions for specific population groups (such as HCWs) and settings (such as health facilities) or indicate the quality and summary of the findings. Although, we could not pool the findings of the studies in the current review because of the heterogeneity of the interventions and outcome measures, we have indicated the quality of evidence for findings reported in this review. These summarized findings may guide policy makers, practitioners and researchers to make appropriate decisions. Nevertheless, the poor quality of evidence supporting most of the findings poses a challenge, especially for practitioners and policy makers.\nMost studies were excluded from this review because of poor quality of evidence, mainly related to measurement bias. Therefore, future studies need to fill these gaps. As has been recommended in previous systematic reviews, it is important to focus on the design of the studies, which includes paying attention to internal validities and the use of instruments to measure SAD. In addition, there was variability among the measures used in the studies included in the review. This might have been attributed to the absence of standardized measurements. Future studies may fill these gaps as efforts are being made to develop standard tools and instruments to reduce SAD and to monitor these efforts. This, however, will be possible only if the researchers are aware of the recent developments in measurements and scales. Moreover, further study is needed to identify effective interventions to reduce internalized stigma and secondary stigma among HCWs. It is also worth noting that this review did not address health professionals in pre-service training. Hence, knowledge building interventions or curriculum-based stigma reduction interventions have been missed in this review.\nConclusions\nImplications for practice\nModerate quality evidence indicates that training popular opinion leaders is effective in reducing HCWs' avoidance intent and prejudicial attitude towards PLHIV and improving compliance to universal precaution. Very low quality evidence indicates that interventions addressing both fear-based stigma and social stigma are more effective in reducing fear-based stigma and the practice extra-precautions when treating HIV positive patients, when compared to interventions addressing only fear-based stigma. Very low quality evidence indicates that the following are effective in reducing stigma-related outcomes: a) professionally-assisted peer group interventions, b) modular interactive training and discussions, c) participatory self-guided assessment and interventions, d) contact strategy with information giving and empowerment, e) workshops comprising didactic lectures. When utilizing the evidence from the current review in policy making and in practice, it is vital to consider the quality of evidence supporting the findings and the limitations of the primary studies reported.\nImplications for research\nFurther RCTs are needed to provide evidence that guides interventions to reduce HIV-related stigma and discrimination in healthcare settings. Future trials need to use up-to-date instruments to measure stigma and discrimination. Studies are needed to address internalized stigma and secondary stigma among healthcare providers. Further attempts should be made to standardize measures for HIV-related stigma and discrimination.\nSupporting information\nAbbreviations\nAIDS\nAcquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome\nCDC\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention\nCI\nConfidence interval\nDALYs\nDisability Adjusted Life Years\nGRADE\nGrading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation\nHCT\nHIV Counseling and Testing\nHIV\nHuman Immunodeficiency Virus\nJBI\nThe Joanna Briggs Institute\nMD\nMean Difference\nNWQ\nNurses' Willingness Questionnaire\nOR\nOdds ratio\nP value\nProbability value\nPLC\nPeople Living Close to HIV\nPLHIV\nPeople Living with HIV\nPOL\nPopular Opinion Leader\nPRISMA\nPreferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses\nQOL\nQuality of Life\nRCT\nRandomized Controlled Trial\nSD\nStandard deviation\nSAD\nStigma and discrimination\nSOF\nSummary of Findings table\nUNAIDS\nJoint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS\nUSA\nUnited States of America\nUSAID\nUnited States Aid for International Development\nReferences\nThe burden of HIV: insights from the Global Burden of Disease Study 2010\nGlobal HIV &amp; AIDS statistics:2018 fact sheet, last accessed on 08/01/2019, available from: http://www.unaids.org/sites/default/files/media_asset/UNAIDS_FactSheet_en.pdf\nJoint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS.

A total of 255 healthcare providers responded to questionnaires asking about sociodemographic characteristics, HIV knowledge, perceived institutional support and HIV-related stigma and discrimination.\n\n Factor analysis was employed to create measurement scales for stigma and factor scores were used in one way analysis of variance (ANOVA), T-tests, Pearsons correlation and multiple linear regression analyses.\n\n Qualitative data collected using key-informant interviews and Focus Group Discussions (FGDs) were employed to triangulate with the findings from the quantitative survey.\n\n\nResults\nMean stigma scores (as the percentages of maximum scale scores) were: 66.4 for the extra precaution scale, 52.3 for the fear of work-related HIV transmission, 49.4 for the lack of feelings of safety, 39.0 for the value-driven stigma, 37.4 for unethical treatment of PLHIV, 34.4 for discomfort around PLHIV and 31.1 for unofficial disclosure.\n\n Testing and disclosing test results without consent, designating HIV clients and unnecessary referral to other healthcare institutions and refusal to treat clients were identified.\n\n Having in-depth HIV knowledge, the perception of institutional support, attending training on stigma and discrimination, educational level of degree or higher, high HIV case loads, the presence of ART service in the healthcare facility and claiming to be non-religious were negative predictors of stigma and discrimination as measured by the seven latent factors.\n\n\nConclusions\nHigher levels of stigma and discrimination against PLHIV were associated with lack of in-depth knowledge on HIV and orientation about policies against stigma and discrimination.\n\n Hence, we recommend health managers to ensure institutional support through availing of clear policies and guidelines and the provision of appropriate training on the management of HIV/AIDS.\n\n\n","id":"PMC3506482","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"BioMed Central","authors":[{"firstname":"Garumma

However few studies have examined the association of HIV stigma with multiple components of HIV treatment and care.\n\n\nObjectives\nTo estimate the association between HIV stigma and: self-reported

study.\n\n\nParticipants\n202 PLHA living in Los Angeles County in 2007.\nMeasurements\nParticipants completed an anonymous survey, assessing internalized HIV stigma (28-items, alpha = 0.93), self-reported access to medical care (six items, alpha = 0.75), regular source of HIV care, and antiretroviral therapy (ART) adherence.\n\n\nResults\nOne-third of participants reported high levels of stigma; 77% reported poor access to care; 42.5% reported suboptimal ART adherence; and 10.5% reported no regular source of HIV care.\n\n In unadjusted analysis, those reporting a high level of stigma were more likely to report poor access to care (OR?=?4.97, 95% CI 2.549.72), regular source of HIV care (OR?=?2.48, 95% CI 1.006.19), and ART adherence (OR?=?2.45, 95% CI 1.234.91).\n\n In adjusted

on quality of prevention of mother-to-child transmission and postnatal care for HIV-infected women and their children","abstract":"Background\nPrevention of mother-to-child transmission has been considered as not a simple intervention but a comprehensive set of interventions requiring capable health workers.\n\n Viet Nam's extensive health care system reaches the village level, but still HIV-infected mothers and children have received inadequate health care services for prevention of mother-to-child transmission.\n\n We report here the health workers' perceptions on factors that lead to their failure to give good quality prevention of mother-to-child transmission services.\n\n\nMethods\nSemistructured interviews with 53 health workers and unstructured observations in nine health facilities in Hanoi were conducted.\n\n Selection of respondents was based on their function, position and experience in the development or implementation of prevention of mother-to-child transmission policies/programmes.\n\n\nResults\nFactors that lead to health workers' failure to give good quality services for prevention of mother-to-child transmission include their own fear of HIV infection; lack of knowledge on HIV and counselling skills; or high workloads and lack of staff; unavailability of HIV testing at commune level; shortage of antiretroviral drugs; and lack of operational guidelines.\n\n A negative attitude during counselling and provision of care, treating in a separate area and avoidance of providing service at all were seen by health workers as the result of fear of being infected, as well as distrust towards almost all HIV-infected patients because of the prevailing association with antisocial behaviours.\n\n Additionally, the fragmentation of the health care system into specialized vertical pillars, including a vertical programme for HIV/AIDS, is a major obstacle to providing a continuum of care.\n\n\nConclusion\nMany hospital staff were not being able to provide good care or were even unwilling to provide appropriate care for HIV-positive pregnant women The study suggests that the quality of prevention of mother-to-child transmission service could be enhanced by improving communication and other skills of health workers, providing them with greater support and enhancing their motivation.\n\n Reduction of workload would also be important.\n\n Development of a practical strategy is needed to strengthen and adapt the referral system to meet the needs of patients.\n\n\n","id":"PMC2684067","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"BioMed

associated with HIV and AIDS can be reduced through intervention.\n The inclusion of stigma and discrimination reduction as a critical component of achieving an AIDS-free generation in recent UNAIDS, UN and PEPFAR political initiatives is promising.\n Yet national governments need evidence on effective interventions at the individual, community and societal levels in order to strategically incorporate stigma and discrimination reduction into national AIDS plans.\n Currently, the heterogeneity of stigma and discrimination reduction approaches and measurement makes it challenging to compare and contrast evaluated interventions.\n Moving forward, it is critical for the research community to: (1) clearly link intervention activities to the domains of stigma to be shifted; (2) assess the stigma domains in a consistent manner; and (3) link stigma and discrimination reduction with HIV prevention, care and treatment outcomes (e.\ng.\n, uptake, adherence and retention of ART).\n These steps would further advance the scientific evidence base of stigma and discrimination reduction and allow for the identification of effective interventions that could be scaled up by national governments.\n","id":"PMC3833103","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"International AIDS Society","authors":[{"firstname":"Cynthia

persons living with HIV/AIDS (PLHA).\n\n However few studies have examined the association of HIV stigma with multiple components of HIV treatment and care.\n\n\nObjectives\nTo estimate the association between HIV stigma and: self-reported access to care, regular source of HIV care, and antiretroviral therapy adherence; and to test whether mental health mediates these associations.\n\n \nDesign\nCross-sectional study.\n\n\nParticipants\n202 PLHA living in Los Angeles County in 2007.\nMeasurements\nParticipants completed an anonymous survey, assessing internalized HIV stigma (28-items, alpha = 0.93), self-reported access to medical care (six items, alpha = 0.75), regular source of HIV care, and antiretroviral therapy (ART) adherence.\n\n\nResults\nOne-third of participants reported high levels of stigma; 77% reported poor access to care; 42.5% reported suboptimal ART adherence; and 10.5% reported no regular source of HIV care.\n\n In unadjusted analysis, those reporting a high level of stigma were more likely to report poor access to care (OR?=?4.97, 95% CI 2.549.72), regular source of HIV care (OR?=?2.48, 95% CI 1.006.19), and ART adherence (OR?=?2.45, 95% CI 1.234.91).\n\n In adjusted analyses, stigma was significantly associated with poor access to care (OR?=?4.42, 95% CI 1.8810.37), but not regular source of HIV care or ART adherence.\n\n Mental health mediated the relationship between stigma and ART adherence, but not poor access to care or regular source of HIV care.\n\n\nConclusions\nThe association of stigma with self-reported access to care and adherence suggests that efforts to improve these components of HIV care will require a better understanding of the possible effects of stigma and it?s mediators.\n\n\n","id":"PMC2762503","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Springer-Verlag","authors":[{"firstname":"Jennifer

Discrimination and Adherence to Medical Care in a Racially Integrated Community","abstract":"Background\nPast research indicates that access to health care and utilization of services varies by sociodemographic characteristics, but little is known about racial differences in health care utilization within racially integrated communities.\n\n\nObjective\nTo determine whether perceived discrimination was associated with delays in seeking medical care and adherence to medical care recommendations among African Americans and whites living in a socioeconomically homogenous and racially integrated community.\n\n\nDesign\nA cross-sectional analysis from the Exploring Health Disparities in Integrated Communities Study.\n\n\nParticipants\nStudy participants include 1,408 African-American (59.3%) and white (40.7%) adults (?18 years) in Baltimore, Md.\n\n\nMeasurements\nAn interviewer-administered questionnaire was used to assess the associations of perceived discrimination with help-seeking behavior for and adherence to medical care.\n\n\nResults\nFor both African Americans and whites, a report of 12 and &gt;2 discrimination experiences in ones lifetime were associated with more medical care delays and nonadherence compared to those with no experiences after adjustment for need, enabling, and predisposing factors (odds ratio [OR]?=?1.8, 2.6; OR?=?2.2, 3.3, respectively; all P?&lt;?.\n\n05).\n\n Results were similar for perceived discrimination occurring in the past year.\n\n\nConclusions\nExperiences with discrimination were associated with delays in seeking medical care and poor adherence to medical care recommendations INDEPENDENT OF NEED, ENABLING, AND PREDISPOSING FACTORS, INCLUDING MEDICAL MISTRUST; however, a prospective study is needed.\n\n Further research in this area should include exploration of other potential mechanisms for the association between perceived discrimination and health service utilization.\n\n\n","id":"PMC1824749","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Springer-Verlag","authors":[{"firstname":"Sarah

Data were extracted into Excel spreadsheets.\n\n The PRISMA and AMSTAR checklists were used to assess reporting characteristics and methodological quality, respectively.\n\n\nResults\nA total of 369

representative cross-sectional sample of published SRs and examine them in terms of a broad range of epidemiological, descriptive, and reporting characteristics, including emerging aspects not previously examined.\n\n\nMethods and Findings\nWe searched Medline for SRs indexed during November 2004 and written in English.\n\n Citations were screened and those meeting our inclusion criteria were retained.\n\n Data were collected using a 51-item data collection form designed to assess the epidemiological and reporting details and the bias-related aspects of the reviews.\n\n The data were analyzed descriptively.\n\n In total 300 SRs were identified, suggesting a current annual publication rate of about 2,500, involving more than 33,700 separate studies including one-third of a million participants.\n\n The majority (272 [90.7%]) of SRs were reported in specialty journals.\n\n Most reviews (213 [71.0%]) were categorized as therapeutic, and included a median of 16 studies involving 1,112 participants.\n\n Funding sources were not reported in more than one-third (122 [40.7%]) of the reviews.\n\n Reviews typically searched a median of three electronic databases and two other sources, although only about two-thirds (208 [69.3%]) of them reported the years searched.\n\n Most (197/295 [66.8%]) reviews reported information about quality assessment, while few (68/294 [23.1%]) reported assessing for publication bias.\n\n A little over half (161/300 [53.7%]) of the SRs reported combining their results statistically, of which most (147/161 [91.3%]) assessed for consistency across studies.\n\n Few (53 [17.7%]) SRs reported being updates of previously completed reviews.\n\n No review had a registration number.\n\n Only half (150 [50.0%]) of the reviews used the term systematic review or meta-analysis in the title or abstract.\n\n There were large differences between Cochrane reviews and non-Cochrane reviews in the quality of reporting several characteristics.\n\n\nConclusions\nSRs are now produced in large numbers, and our data suggest that the quality of their reporting is inconsistent.\n\n This situation might be improved if more widely agreed upon evidence-based reporting guidelines were endorsed and adhered to by authors and journals.\n\n These results substantiate the view that readers should not accept SRs uncritically.\n\n\n","id":"PMC1831728","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Public Library of

A Cochrane review<sup>a</sup>","abstract":"Background\nThe Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) Statement is intended to facilitate better reporting of randomised clinical trials (RCTs).\n\n A systematic review recently published in the Cochrane Library assesses whether journal endorsement of CONSORT impacts the completeness of reporting of RCTs; those findings are summarised here.\n\n\nMethods\nEvaluations assessing the completeness of reporting of RCTs based on any of 27 outcomes formulated based on the 1996 or 2001 CONSORT checklists were included; two primary comparisons were evaluated.\n\n The 27 outcomes were: the 22 items of the 2001 CONSORT checklist, four sub-items describing blinding and a total summary score of aggregate items, as reported.\n\n Relative risks (RR) and 99% confidence intervals were calculated to determine effect estimates for each outcome across evaluations.\n\n\nResults\nFifty-three reports describing 50 evaluations of 16,604 RCTs were assessed for adherence to at least one of 27 outcomes.\n\n Sixty-nine of 81 meta-analyses show relative benefit from CONSORT endorsement on completeness of reporting.\n\n Between endorsing and non-endorsing journals, 25 outcomes are improved with CONSORT endorsement, five of these significantly (? = 0.01).\n\n The number of evaluations per meta-analysis was often low with substantial heterogeneity; validity was assessed as low or unclear for many evaluations.\n\n\nConclusions\nThe results of this review suggest that journal endorsement of CONSORT may benefit the completeness of reporting of RCTs they publish.\n\n No evidence suggests that endorsement hinders the completeness of RCT reporting.\n\n However, despite relative improvements when CONSORT is endorsed by journals, the completeness of reporting of trials remains sub-optimal.\n\n Journals are not sending a clear message about endorsement to authors submitting manuscripts for publication.\n\n As such, fidelity of endorsement as an intervention has been weak to date.\n\n Journals need to take further action regarding their endorsement and implementation of CONSORT to facilitate accurate, transparent and complete reporting of trials.\n\n\n","id":"PMC3564748","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"BioMed

of acupuncture since the publication of the STRICTA and CONSORT statements.\n\n We conducted a before-and-after study, comparing ratings for quality of reporting following the publication of both STRICTA and CONSORT recommendations.\n\n\nMethodology and Principal Findings\nNinety peer reviewed journal articles reporting the results of acupuncture trials were selected at random from a wider sample frame of 266 papers.\n\n Papers published in three distinct time periods (19941995, 19992000 and 20042005) were compared.\n\n Assessment criteria were developed directly from CONSORT and STRICTA checklists.\n\n Papers were independently assessed for quality of reporting by two assessors, one of whom was blind to information which could have introduced systematic bias (e.\n\ng.\n\n date of publication).\n\n We detected a statistically significant increase in the reporting of CONSORT items for papers published in each time period measured.\n\n We did not, however, find a difference between the number of STRICTA items reported in journal articles published before and 3 to 4 years following the introduction of STRICTA recommendations.\n\n\nConclusions and Significance\nThe results of this study suggest that general standards of reporting for acupuncture trials have significantly improved since the introduction of the CONSORT statement in 1996, but that quality in reporting details specific to acupuncture interventions has yet to change following the more recent introduction of STRICTA recommendations.\n\n Wider targeting and revision of the guidelines is recommended.\n\n\n","id":"PMC2216683","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Public Library of Science","authors":[{"firstname":"Stephanie

Systematic Reviews: An International Consultation","abstract":"Background\nIn response to growing recognition of the value of prospective registration of systematic review protocols, we planned to develop a web-based open access international register.\n\n In order for the register to fulfil its aims of reducing unplanned duplication, reducing publication bias, and providing greater transparency, it was important to ensure the appropriate data were collected.\n\n We therefore undertook a consultation process with experts in the field to identify a minimum dataset for registration.\n\n\nMethods and Findings\nA two-round electronic modified Delphi survey design was used.\n\n The international panel surveyed included experts from areas relevant to systematic review including commissioners, clinical and academic researchers, methodologists, statisticians, information specialists, journal editors and users of systematic reviews.\n\n Direct invitations to participate were sent out to 315 people in the first round and 322 in the second round.\n\n Responses to an open invitation to participate were collected separately.\n\n There were 194 (143 invited and 51 open) respondents with a 100% completion rate in the first round and 209 (169 invited and 40 open) respondents with a 91% completion rate in the second round.\n\n In the second round, 113 (54%) of the participants reported having previously taken part in the first round.\n\n Participants were asked to indicate whether a series of potential items should be designated as optional or required registration items, or should not be included in the register.\n\n After the second round, a 70% or greater agreement was reached on the designation of 30 of 36 items.\n\n\nConclusions\nThe results of the Delphi exercise have established a dataset of 22 required items for the prospective registration of systematic reviews, and 18 optional items.\n\n The dataset captures the key attributes of review design as well as the administrative details necessary for registration.\n\n\n","id":"PMC3217945","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Public Library of

Symbolic Stigma and HIV Misconceptions are Associated with Support for Coercive Measures in Urban India","abstract":"This study was designed to examine the prevalence of stigma and its underlying factors in two large Indian cities.\n Cross-sectional interview data were collected from 1,076 non-HIV patients in multiple healthcare settings in Mumbai and Bengaluru, India.\n The vast majority of participants supported mandatory testing for marginalized groups and coercive family policies for PLHA, stating that they deserved their infections and didnt care about infecting others.\n Most participants did not want to be treated at the same clinic or use the same utensils as PLHA and transmission misconceptions were common.\n Multiple linear regression showed that blame, transmission misconceptions, symbolic stigma and negative feelings toward PLHA were significantly associated with both stigma and discrimination.\n The results indicate an urgent need for continued stigma reduction efforts to reduce the suffering of PLHA and barriers to prevention and treatment.\n Given the high levels of blame and endorsement of coercive policies, it is crucial that such programs are shaped within a human rights framework.\n","id":"PMC3313036","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Springer US","authors":[{"firstname":"Maria

A comparative case study from Swaziland","abstract":"Introduction\nIntegrating HIV with primary health services has the potential to reduce HIV-related stigma through delivering care in settings disassociated with HIV.\n\n This study investigated the relationship between integrated care and felt stigma.\n\n The study design was a comparative case study of four models of HIV care in Swaziland, ranging from fully integrated to fully stand-alone HIV care.\n\n\nMethods\nAn exit survey (N=602) measured differences in felt stigma across model of care; the primary outcome perception of HIV status exposure through clinic attendance was analyzed using multivariable logistic regression.\n\n In-depth interviews (N=22) explored whether and how measured differences in stigma experiences were related to service integration.\n\n\nResults\nThere were significant differences in perceived status exposure across models of care.\n\n After adjustment for potential confounding between sites, those at a partially integrated site and a partially stand-alone site had greater odds of perceived status exposure than those at the fully stand-alone site (aOR 3.33, 95% CI 1.985.60; and aOR 11.84, 95% CI 6.8920.36, respectively).\n\n There was no difference between the fully stand-alone and the fully integrated clinic.\n\n Qualitative data suggested that many clients at HIV-only sites felt greater confidentiality knowing that those around them were positive, and support was gained from other HIV care clients.\n\n Confidentiality was maintained in various ways, even in stand-alone sites, through separate waiting areas for HIV testing and HIV treatment, and careful clinic and room labelling.\n\n\nConclusions\nThe relationship between model of care and stigma was complex, and the hypothesis that stigma is higher at stand-alone sites did not hold true in this high prevalence setting.\n\n Policy-makers should ensure that service integration does not increase stigma, in particular within partially integrated models of care.\n\n\n","id":"PMC3545202","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"International AIDS

HIV-positive women of African descent (African/Black diaspora).\n\n However, limited evidence exists on the effectiveness of interventions aimed at reducing stigma tailored for these women.\n\n This study systematically reviewed randomized controlled trials (RCTs), non-randomized observational and quasi-experimental studies evaluating the effectiveness of interventions aimed at reducing stigma experienced by this population.\n\n\nMethods\nThe Cochrane methodology was used to develop a search strategy in consultation with a librarian scientist.\n\n Databases searched included the Cochrane Library, Ovid EMBASE, PsycInfo, and 10 others.\n\n Two reviewers independently assessed the studies for potential relevance and conducted the Cochrane grading of RCTs to assess risk of bias and the NewcastleOttawa scale to assess the quality of non-randomized studies.\n\n Eligible papers were selected if they employed an intervention design with African/Black diasporic women living with HIV as the target population and had a primary outcome of stigma reduction.\n\n\nResults\nOf the five studies that met all of the eligibility criteria, four demonstrated the effectiveness of interventions in reducing HIV-related stigma.\n\n Only two of the five studies were designed specifically for HIV-positive African/Black diasporic women.\n\n Limitations included the absence of interventions addressing other forms of stigma and discrimination (e.\n\ng.\n\n gender discrimination, racism, heterosexism).\n\n\nConclusions\nOur findings suggest that there are limited interventions designed to address multiple forms of stigma, including gender and racial discrimination, experienced by HIV-positive African/Black diasporic women.\n\n\n","id":"PMC4393416","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"International AIDS

Data were collected in two government and two faith-based private not-for-profit hospitals purposively selected in rural districts in Uganda's Central Region.\n\n Researchers interviewed 237 people using a structured questionnaire and held four focus group discussions and 44 in-depth interviews.\n\n\nResults\nHIV/AIDS places both physical and, to some extent, emotional demands on health workers.\n\n Eighty-six per cent of respondents reported an increased workload, with 48 per cent regularly working overtime, while 83 per cent feared infection at work, and 36 per cent reported suffering an injury in the previous year.\n\n HIV-positive staff remained in hiding, and most staff did not want to get tested as they feared stigmatization.\n\n Organizational responses were implemented haphazardly and were limited to providing protective materials and the HIV/AIDS-related services offered to patients.\n\n Although most staff felt motivated to work, not being motivated was associated with a lack of daily supervision, a lack of awareness on the availability of HIV/AIDS counselling, using antiretrovirals and working overtime.\n\n The specific hospital context influenced staff perceptions and experiences.\n\n\nConclusion\nHIV/AIDS is a crucially important contextual factor, impacting on working conditions in various ways.\n\n Therefore, organizational responses should be integrated into responses to other problematic working conditions and adapted to the local context.\n\n Opportunities already exist, such as better use of supervision, educational sessions and staff meetings.\n\n However, exchanges on interventions to improve staff motivation and address HIV/AIDS in the health sector are urgently required, including information on results and details of the context and implementation process.\n\n\n","id":"PMC2244629","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"BioMed

Patients with HIV/AIDS in Nigeria","abstract":"Background\nNigeria has an estimated 3.6 million people with HIV/AIDS and is home to one out of every 11 people with HIV/AIDS worldwide.\n\n This study is the first population-based assessment of discrimination against people living with HIV/AIDS in the health sector of a country.\n\n The purpose of this study was to characterize the nature and extent of discriminatory practices and attitudes in the health sector and indicate possible contributing factors and intervention strategies.\n\n The study involved a cross-sectional survey of 1,021 Nigerian health-care professionals (including 324 physicians, 541 nurses, and 133 midwives identified by profession) in 111 health-care facilities in four Nigerian states.\n\n\nMethods and Findings\nFifty-four percent of the health-care professionals (550/1,021) were sampled from public tertiary care facilities.\n\n Nine percent of professionals reported refusing to care for an HIV/AIDS patient, and 9% indicated that they had refused an HIV/AIDS patient admission to a hospital.\n\n Fifty-nine percent agreed that people with HIV/AIDS should be on a separate ward, and 40% believed a person's HIV status could be determined by his or her appearance.\n\n Ninety-one percent agreed that staff and health-care professionals should be informed when a patient is HIV-positive so they can protect themselves.\n\n Forty percent believed that health-care professionals with HIV/AIDS should not be allowed to work in any area of health-care that requires patient contact.\n\n Twenty percent agreed that many with HIV/AIDS behaved immorally and deserve the disease.\n\n Basic materials needed for treatment and prevention of HIV were not adequately available.\n\n Twelve percent agreed that treatment of opportunistic infections in HIV/AIDS patients wastes resources, and 8% indicated that treating someone with HIV/AIDS is a waste of precious resources.\n\n Providers who reported working in facilities that did not always practice universal precautions were more likely to favor restrictive policies toward people with HIV/AIDS.\n\n Providers who reported less adequate training in HIV treatment and ethics were also more likely to report negative attitudes toward patients with HIV/AIDS.\n\n There was no consistent pattern of differences in negative attitudes and practices across the different health specialties surveyed.\n\n\nConclusion\nWhile most health-care professionals surveyed reported being in compliance with their ethical obligations despite the lack of resources, discriminatory behavior and attitudes toward patients with HIV/AIDS exist among a significant proportion of health-care professionals in the surveyed states.\n\n Inadequate education about HIV/AIDS and a lack of protective and treatment materials appear to contribute to these practices and attitudes.\n\n\n","id":"PMC1176239","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Public Library of

Peer Mentors to Support South African Women Living with HIV and Their Infants","abstract":"Objective\nWe evaluate the effect of clinic-based support by HIV-positive Peer Mentors, in addition to standard clinic care, on maternal and infant well-being among Women Living with HIV (WLH) from pregnancy through the infant's first year of life.\n\n\nMethods\nIn a cluster randomized controlled trial in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, eight clinics were randomized for pregnant WLH to receive either: a Standard Care condition (SC; 4 clinics; n?=?656 WLH); or an Enhanced Intervention (EI; 4 clinics; n?=?544 WLH).\n\n WLH in the EI were invited to attend four antenatal and four postnatal meetings led by HIV-positive Peer Mentors, in addition to SC.\n\n WLH were recruited during pregnancy, and at least two post-birth assessment interviews were completed by 57% of WLH at 1.5, 6 or 12 months.\n\n EI's effect was ascertained on 19 measures of maternal and infant well-being using random effects regressions to control for clinic clustering.\n\n A binomial test for correlated outcomes evaluated EI's overall efficacy.\n\n\nFindings\nWLH attended an average of 4.1 sessions (SD?=?2.0); 13% did not attend any sessions.\n\n Significant overall benefits were found in EI compared to SC using the binomial test.\n\n Secondarily, over time, WLH in the EI reported significantly fewer depressive symptoms and fewer underweight infants than WLH in the SC condition.\n\n EI WLH were significantly more likely to use one feeding method for six months and exclusively breastfeed their infants for at least 6 months.\n\n\nConclusions\nWLH benefit by support from HIV-positive Peer Mentors, even though EI participation was partial, with incomplete follow-up rates from 612 months.\n\n\nTrial

diasporic women","abstract":"Introduction\nLiterature indicates that racism, sexism, homophobia and HIV-related stigma have adverse impacts on health, well-being, and quality of life among HIV-positive women of African descent (African/Black diaspora).\n\n However, limited evidence exists on the effectiveness of interventions aimed at reducing stigma tailored for these women.\n\n This study systematically reviewed randomized controlled trials (RCTs), non-randomized observational and quasi-experimental studies evaluating the effectiveness of interventions aimed at reducing stigma experienced by this population.\n\n\nMethods\nThe Cochrane methodology was used to develop a search strategy in consultation with a librarian scientist.\n\n Databases searched included the Cochrane Library, Ovid EMBASE, PsycInfo, and 10 others.\n\n Two reviewers independently assessed the studies for potential relevance and conducted the Cochrane grading of RCTs to assess risk of bias and the NewcastleOttawa scale to assess the quality of non-randomized studies.\n\n Eligible papers were selected if they employed an intervention design with African/Black diasporic women living with HIV as the target population and had a primary outcome of stigma reduction.\n\n\nResults\nOf the five studies that met all of the eligibility criteria, four demonstrated the effectiveness of interventions in reducing HIV-related stigma.\n\n Only two of the five studies were designed specifically for HIV-positive African/Black diasporic women.\n\n Limitations included the absence of interventions addressing other forms of stigma and discrimination (e.\n\ng.\n\n gender discrimination, racism, heterosexism).\n\n\nConclusions\nOur findings suggest that there are limited interventions designed to address multiple forms of stigma, including gender and racial discrimination, experienced by HIV-positive African/Black diasporic women.\n\n\n","id":"PMC4393416","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"International AIDS

strategy: a review of literature","abstract":"Background and objectives\nWomen living with HIV/AIDS, in particular, have been positioned as a latent source of infection, and have captivated culpability and blame leading to a highly stigmatised and discriminated life.\n\n Despite the situation, women and their particular concerns have largely been ignored in HIV/AIDS research literature.\n\n\nMethodology\nA systematic literature search was carried out on major data bases ASSIA, CINAHL, Science Direct, Web of Knowledge, Wiley Inter Science, AMED, Pub Med/Bio Med Central, MEDLINE and Cochrane Library.\n\n The articles included for review purpose were gauged against the pre-defined inclusion/exclusion criteria and quality assessment checklist resulting in a final 7 papers.\n\n\nFindings/results\nThe findings were compiled into five thematic areas: (1) Disclosure as a sensitive issue; (2) Stigma and Discrimination associated with HIV/AIDS and the multidimensional effects on womens health and wellbeing; (3) Internalised Stigma; (4) Women living with HIV/AIDS experiences of being rejected, shunned and treated differently by physicians, family and close friends; (5) Support Group as among the best available interventions for stigma and discrimination.\n\n\nConclusion\nSupport groups should be offered as a fundamental part of HIV/AIDS services and should be advocated as an effective and useful intervention.\n\n Further research is needed to examine the effect of support groups for women living with HIV/AIDS.\n\n A community based randomised controlled trial with support group as an intervention and a control group could provide further evidence of the value of support groups.\n\n\nElectronic supplementary material\nThe online version of this

More targeted interventions (e.g. at the workplace) seem to be a promising and necessary supplement to public campaigns, but little is known about their effectiveness. The aim of this systematic review is to provide an overview of the evidence on the effectiveness of interventions targeting the stigma of mental illness at the workplace.\nMethods\nSixteen studies were included after the literature review. The effectiveness of anti-stigma interventions at the workplace was assessed by examining changes in: (1) knowledge of mental disorders and their treatment and recognition of signs/symptoms of mental illness, (2) attitudes towards people with mental-health problems, and (3) supportive behavior.\nResults\nThe results indicate that anti-stigma interventions at the workplace can lead to improved employee knowledge and supportive behavior towards people with mental-health problems. The effects of interventions on employees' attitudes were mixed, but generally positive. The quality of evidence varied across studies.\nConclusions\nThis highlights the need for more rigorous, higher-quality evaluations conducted with more diverse samples of the working population. Future research should explore to what extent changes in employees' knowledge, attitudes, and supportive behavior lead to affected individuals seeking help earlier. Such investigations are likely to inform important stakeholders about the potential benefits of current workplace anti-stigma interventions and provide guidance for the development and implementation of effective future interventions.\nElectronic supplementary material\nThe online version of this article (doi:10.1186/s12888-015-0706-4) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.\nBackground\nDespite the availability of effective mental-health treatment, the majority of people experiencing mental-health problems do not seek help. Globally, the number of people experiencing mental disorders who do not receive any healthcare treatment is estimated to reach up to 70 %. This figure is alarming, given the high prevalence of mental-health problems among the general population (one in four at some point during their lifetime). Several factors have been identified that contribute to the treatment gap between true and treated prevalence: (1) lack of knowledge of the symptoms of mental illness and how to access treatment, (2) prejudicial attitudes, and (3) anticipated or real acts of discrimination against people who have mental-health problems. These factors combined have been defined as 'stigma', which has far-reaching consequences for those affected.\nThe level of accurate knowledge about mental illnesses among the general public has been reported to be rather low. For example, in a population survey in England, 63 % estimated that less than 10 % of the population would be likely to experience a mental-health problem at some time in their lives. However, improved knowledge of mental-health problems was shown to have a crucial effect on the ability to recognize signs of mental illness, as well as on supporting help-seeking and accepting treatment.\nNegative attitudes or prejudice refer to negative thoughts and emotions, such as anxiety or disgust, a majority group holds against a minority group. This may include public beliefs concerning mental illness, which often revolve around dangerousness and incompetence, expectations of poor prognosis, and a desire for social distance.\nDiscrimination forms the behavioral dimension of stigma and refers to any acts to the disadvantage of people who are stigmatized. For example, one study reported that 47 % of the general public would not be willing to work closely with people diagnosed with depression, and 30 % would be unwilling to socialize with them.\nPublic stigma as described above can induce 'self-stigma' (internalization of stigmatizing attitudes), which results in diminished self-esteem and self-efficacy in people with mental-health problems. The adverse effects of stigma influence various aspects of life and add an additional burden on those already dealing with a mental illness. Perhaps most devastating is the impact of stigma as a major barrier to accessing mental-health treatment.\nAlthough the stigma of mental illness has been extensively researched among the general population, little is known about its prevalence and consequences at the workplace. Some studies suggest that the stigma of mental illness may also be an important contributing factor to the underutilization of healthcare services at work. Kim et al. found that soldiers failed to get treatment for Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) because they were concerned about being stigmatized by others for having mental-health problems. Similar results have been obtained in studies on white-collar workers and the utilization of an Employee Assistance Program (EAP). Walton found that employees were worried that their managers would have a negative opinion of them if they were aware of their use of mental-health services. Moreover, employees were reluctant to use counseling services at work if they believed it would negatively affect their career opportunities. This clearly illustrates that the stigma of mental illness has a negative impact on the utilization of healthcare services at work and results in employees waiting until their symptoms severely interfere with their daily functioning instead of seeking support early. Stigma not only poses a barrier to mental-health treatment after the onset of illness, but also interferes with prevention efforts during early stages of the illness.\nThe debilitating impact of mental illness at work is widely recognized, and resulting total work loss due to absenteeism, presenteeism, and turnover is estimated to cost organizations in the UK $26 billion a year. Given the high prevalence of mental-health problems in the general and working population, the workplace is increasingly being recognized as an important target of mental-health promotion, prevention, and interventions. Those efforts may remain ineffective if stigma is not removed and a supportive work environment is not created. Therefore, effective strategies to reduce the stigma of mental illness and to increase help-seeking behavior at the workplace are needed. Unfortunately, research on their effectiveness is scarce and presents inconclusive evidence in this field.\nAlthough six systematic reviews investigating anti-stigma reduction programs have been conducted, none of them focused specifically on workplace interventions. Two non-systematic reviews of current workplace anti-stigma programs were published, but they were mainly conceptual in nature rather than evaluating the effectiveness of the interventions. Insight in improve existing efforts in the development of targeted workplace anti-stigma interventions is sorely lacking.\nSuch an investigation could inform important stakeholders about the effectiveness of current workplace anti-stigma interventions and their potential benefits in terms of an inferred impact on utilization rates of healthcare services (e.g. workplace counselling/EAP etc.) and on employee mental health. Such investigations could strengthen the incentive for organizations to invest in stigma-reduction efforts while providing guidance for the development and implementation of effective future interventions.\nTherefore, based on the conceptual framework of stigma by Thornicroft as described earlier, this review aims to provide a first systematic review on the effectiveness of workplace anti-stigma interventions by examining changes in: (1) knowledge of mental disorders and their treatment and recognition of signs/symptoms of mental illness, (2) attitudes towards people with mental-health problems, and (3) supportive behavior among colleagues (e.g. reduced discriminatory or increased affirmative behavior, help seeking, etc.). We chose to adhere to this conceptualization because, in contrast to the majority of evaluation studies, we wanted to place particular emphasis on measuring behavioral outcomes of stigma-reduction programs and help-seeking.\nMethods\nA systematic literature review on the effectiveness of workplace anti-stigma interventions was carried out after methods of the analysis and inclusion criteria had been specified in a protocol.\nEligibility criteria\nFor detailed information on eligibility criteria, please refer to Additional file 1 in the supplementary material.\nStudy designs of interest\nRandomized controlled trials and quasi-experimental studies were included, while longitudinal studies, cohort studies, primary prevention studies, phase-I and II studies, ecologic studies, case reports, case series, cross-sectional studies, and qualitative and economic evaluations were excluded from the analysis. This is because, in contrast to previous descriptive reviews on anti-stigma interventions, this review aimed to focus exclusively on evaluating the effectiveness of workplace anti-stigma programs and, thus, only included experimental studies which provided quantitative evidence.\nStudy participants\nParticipants aged 18-65 in the working population were considered. Studies that targeted mental healthcare providers were excluded from this review because this occupational group already has extensive knowledge of and contact with people with mental-health problems. Preliminary evidence suggests that this group might be fundamentally different in their responses to anti-stigma interventions than people working outside of healthcare. Studies targeting self-stigma in clinical patients were also excluded.\nTypes of interventions\nAll types of interventions targeting stigma against mental illness at the workplace were considered for the current review. Studies were included if they met the following criteria: (1) included an intervention that targeted at least one dimension of stigma as an outcome (any variables related to either knowledge and/or attitude and/or behavior were considered), (2) included an evaluation of the intervention, and (3) the evaluation was quantitative. This meant that programs which targeted any dimension of stigma were included, even though they couldn't necessarily be considered anti-stigma programs per se.\nStudies were excluded if they met the following criteria: (1) self-stigma in clinical patients was targeted, (2) did not include an evaluation of the intervention, or (3) presented only qualitative evaluation data.\nInformation sources\nMedline and PsycINFO were searched for peer-reviewed articles related to workplace anti-stigma interventions carried out between 2004 and 2014. This time span was considered exhaustive enough to include the most recent efforts, as well as those started ten years ago. Only papers in the English, German, Spanish, or Portuguese languages could be read and were selected. References in relevant articles were also screened for publications that might be acceptable for inclusion. An additional Google Scholar search was made to identify relevant grey literature, which is either unpublished or not published in peer-reviewed journals. Experts at the Mental Health Commission of Canada were also consulted for the potential inclusion of unpublished articles.\nThe last search was run on July 1, 2014.\nSearch strategy (see Additional file 1)\nThe search strategy was reviewed independently by subject experts/librarians at the University of Calgary (for full database search strategies, please check the appendix). The following terms were used to search all trial registers and databases: stigma-related terms AND mental health-related terms AND workplace-related terms AND program evaluation-related terms. Limitations were applied with regards to restrictions in type of study design and type of participants as described above, as well as to studies on stigma related to physical health conditions or interventions aiming to reduce drug use (e.g. smoking cessation) unless they provided a quantitative measure on stigma related to drug use and didn't target healthcare providers.\nStigma-related terms: stigma*, labeling, prejudice, social acceptance or social approval, social discrimination, social perception, stereotyped attitudes, shame, discrimination or disability discrimination, judgment, fairness, health services accessibility, treatment barriers.\nMental health-related terms: mental disorders, psychiatric patients, psychiatric symptoms, recovery disorders, relapse disorders, work-related illnesses, mental health, well-being.\nWorkplace-related terms: occupations, employment history, occupational adjustment, occupational tenure, personnel, professional personnel, working women, employment status, employability, reemployment, supported employment, occupational health, industrial and organizational psychology, working conditions, unemployment, personnel termination, downsizing, workplace*, quality of work life, occupational stress, organizational climate.\nProgram evaluation-related terms: mental illness (attitudes toward), mental health program evaluation or mental health programs, community mental health training or mental health inservice training or inservice training or professional development, program development, program evaluation, health promotion, health education or health knowledge or health literacy or social marketing or client education, structured clinical interview or interviews or psychodiagnostic interview or interviewers or interviewing or qualitative research or questioning or narratives or life review or narrative therapy or storytelling or health attitudes or attitudes or disabled (attitudes toward) or employee attitudes or employer attitudes or health personnel attitudes, or occupational attitudes or public opinion or work (attitude toward) or attitude measurement or attitude measures, campaign or initiative or aware or program or train or intervene or workshop or seminar or curriculum or booster session or strategy or implement or course or symposium or coach or mentor or blitz or policy or policies or guideline or recommendation or standard, questionnaires or mail surveys or surveys or telephone surveys.\nStudy selection\nAn eligibility assessment of abstracts and full-text papers was performed in a standardized manner by the lead author (SH), and 20 % of total citations were double checked independently by a second reviewer (CT). Disagreements between reviewers were followed up by double checks and resolved by discussion.\nData extraction\nData on study design, sample characteristics, and findings were extracted by two reviewers (SH, CT) independently (CT double extracted 31 % of total full-text inclusions). The following information was extracted from each included study: (1) objectives, (2) general information (study design, country of origin, number and duration of follow-ups), (3) study population (age, sample size, percentage of female participants, target population), (4) workplace (workplace name, workplace sector, workplace type, job, (5) type of intervention (duration, frequency, target in terms of primary- and secondary- outcome measures, and whether the intervention addressed general mental health or a specific mental illness), and (6) intervention effectiveness (in terms of a change in outcome measures with effect sizes where reported). No further variables were added to those already pre-specified in the protocol after the review had begun.\nStudy quality\nFor all included studies (including grey literature), methodological quality was assessed using a checklist for randomized controlled trials and quasi-experiments. This checklist involved an assessment of four kinds of systematic errors (detection, selection, attrition, and information bias) among a rating scale of low, moderate, or high risk. Two authors (SH, CT) independently rated all studies according to those criteria and resolved discrepancies through discussion. If no agreement could be reached, a third author was consulted.\nData analyses\nA narrative synthesis following the guideline proposed by Popay et al. was undertaken since a meta-analysis of results was not possible due to substantial differences in methodology and outcome data across studies. This involved addressing four main elements of narrative synthesis: a) developing a theory of how the intervention works, why, and for whom, b) developing a preliminary synthesis of findings of included studies, c) exploring relationships within and between studies, and d) assessing the robustness of the synthesis. Extracted information was summarized using the tabular form of the Cochrane review's 'Characteristics of Included Studies' table (participants, interventions, outcomes, notes) with the inclusion of additional information (country of origin, duration of the intervention, target, assessment time points, control group, study design, and the context in which the intervention was delivered).\nResults\nStudy selection\nPreferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) flow diagram. Study selection process\nThe study selection process was carried out according to the PRISMA guidelines on reporting items for systematic reviews. Appropriate studies were identified in Medline and PsycINFO (yielded 758 citations), while 36 additional citations were identified searching Google Scholar, consulting experts of the Mental Health Commission of Canada, and by checking the references of relevant papers. Seven hundred seventy-three studies remained after duplicates were removed. Seven hundred eleven were excluded since they clearly did not meet the criteria after abstract review. After reviewing the full text of the remaining 62 citations, 46 studies were excluded for specific reasons which are listed in the flow chart (see Fig. 1). Sixteen studies were eventually included in the review.\nStudy characteristics\nFor detailed information on study characteristics, please see Additional file 2 in the supplementary material.\nStudy designs\nOf the 16 included studies, five were RCTs, and 11 were quasi-experimental studies. Seven studies included a control group. All studies were published in English.\nSettings and populations\nThe included studies involved 3854 participants. The majority of studies targeted the public sector (12), only two the private sector, and no information on the type of workplace was given for another two. Regarding study populations, most studies examined interventions for managers or supervisors, as well as first responders, such as police officers. Two studies examined interventions in employees routinely working with people with mental-health problems (e.g. housing agencies). Six studies were conducted in Europe, five in the US or Canada, four in Australia, and one in Asia.\nInterventions\nEight studies assessed the impact of Mental Health First Aid (MHFA) training or a modified version of the program on one or more dimensions of stigma. While MHFA is primarily seen to be a mental-health literacy program, they do measure stigma and were therefore included. The remaining eight studies included heterogeneous interventions, such as role play, online training, psychoeducation, workshops, Trauma Risk Management (TRiM), and Crisis Intervention Training (CIT) in first responders. Half of the studies targeted all three dimensions of stigma (i.e. knowledge, attitudes, behavior), while the other half specifically targeted attitudes or behavior. The duration of the interventions varied between a minimum of 1 hour up to a maximum of 2 days.\nOutcomes\nPrimary\nIn all studies the primary outcome was a change in at least one dimension of stigma, namely knowledge and/or attitude and/or behavior. While studies differed with regards to the operationalization of variables for knowledge, attitude, and behavior outcomes, data collection and instruments used to assess change over time were fairly similar across studies.\nSecondary\nSecondary outcomes included change in participants' overall mental health. One study examined readiness to provide actual help to people with mental disorders as the primary outcome while analyzing knowledge, attitudes, and self-confidence in helping a person with a mental disorder as secondary outcomes. One study assessed the cost-effectiveness of the intervention.\nStudy quality\nIn general, all studies included were considered at high risk for detection bias, as at least one dimension of stigma was measured by self-reports (which is, however, fairly standard and about the only feasible way to measure attitudes). With regards to selection, attrition, and information bias, the majority of studies was at high risk of bias due to selective reporting, lack of allocation concealment, lack of participant blinding, and incomplete outcome data. While five studies received an overall rating of low risk for bias, no study had only low risk of bias ratings for the type of bias described above.\nEffectiveness of anti-stigma interventions\nOverview of results of the included studies with regard to intervention effectiveness\nAuthor (Year)	Intervention type	Knowledge*,**	Attitudes*,**	Behavior*,**	Success ratea	 	Svensson &amp; Hansson (2014) 	Mental Health First Aid (Adult)	T C	T	T C	2/3 (67 %)	 	Krameddine et al.

In this study, MHFA training did not result in improved mental-health literacy in the intervention as opposed to the control group. However, since recognition of a mental disorder in a vignette task was already fairly high in the pre-test, this left limited room for improvement post intervention. Six studies with high risk of bias had a positive impact on mental-health literacy. Nevertheless, the impact of their evidence is weaker given the absence of a control group, the lack of randomization procedures, and a high risk of selection bias (e.g. participation in the intervention was voluntary). These findings are supported by other studies of moderate-to-high quality, which confirms a significant positive effect of workplace anti-stigma interventions on employees' mental-health knowledge.\nAttitudes\nFourteen studies measured stigmatizing attitudes or openness towards people or coworkers with mental illness, often using social-distance scales. One study examined specific attitudes related to perceived dangerousness, unpredictability, and recovery of mentally-ill individuals. Another study differentiated between first- and third-person viewpoints with regards to stigma.\nAlthough the effectiveness of interventions on changing attitudes was mixed, nine studies did report improvements in participants' stigmatizing attitudes. Next to the MHFA training, the other types of anti-stigma interventions, such as TRiM, CIT, online training, and workshops, were effective in reducing stigmatizing attitudes towards people with mental-health problems. Of the six studies with low-to-moderate risk for bias, four reported a significant positive effect on participants' attitudes, while two did not note any significant changes. However, while Svensson, Hansson found no overall significant change in attitudes, their analyses of specific items on their stigma scales did reveal positive improvements (e.g. items related to personal stigma, as well as becoming a neighbor of a person with depression). With regards to more specific attitudinal changes, Knifton et al. found particular improvement in relation to unpredictability and recovery, but not for dangerousness.\nBehavior\nEleven studies targeted 'behavior'. Behavior was operationalized in a heterogeneous manner across studies, including both true behavioral measures and proxies. In general, behavioral change was related to increased affirmative behavior, as well as to reductions in discriminatory behavior.\nAll types of anti-stigma interventions in 11 studies (three rated as of high quality) consistently had a significant positive impact on employees' supportive behavior with the exception of one study, which reported a marginally significant effect. More specifically, this involved, for example, perceived confidence and self-efficacy in identifying and dealing with a person with a mental illness, as well as the likelihood of advising people to seek professional help and readiness to provide help in mental-health situations. One study involving police officers examined directly measured behaviors, such as the use of force.\nIn one study, role play was used to achieve behavioral change. Although not intended, the intervention also had a positive effect of mental-health knowledge. Similarly, Moffitt et al. observed a change in behavior achieved by an intervention that targeted knowledge and attitude only.\nSecondary outcomes\nTwo studies of moderate to high quality examined participant mental health as a secondary outcome and reported a positive impact of the anti-stigma intervention. The study including a cost-effectiveness analysis found its anti-stigma intervention (i.e. role play) to be cost-effective.\nSustainability of change\nEleven studies did not include any follow-up measurements beyond the initial two time points (pre-post). This limits the conclusions that can be drawn relating to the effectiveness of anti-stigma interventions over the long term. Five studies conducted a post-intervention follow-up of up to 2 years. All these studies report that the changes achieved in either people's knowledge and/or attitudes and/or behavior post-intervention were, in part, sustained over time. For example, Svensson, Hansson found a significant improvement in knowledge and confidence to provide help, but not in attitudes, and this pattern remained unchanged at a 2-year follow-up.\nDiscussion\nTo our knowledge, this is the first systematic review to examine the effectiveness of interventions targeting stigma towards mental illness at the workplace. The majority of the included studies were published since 2010, reflecting a growing interest in evaluations of stigma-reduction programs at the workplace. Our review illustrates that workplace anti-stigma interventions may be effective in changing employees' knowledge, attitudes, and behavior towards people with mental-health problems. However, due to methodological shortcomings in the majority of the included studies, the lack of follow-ups beyond post-intervention assessments, as well as heterogeneity in terms of intervention content, duration, and outcome measures, the evidence for the effectiveness of workplace anti-stigma interventions is inconclusive and must be interpreted with caution.\nWhile prior systematic reviews of general population interventions corroborate our findings of poor evaluation study design, they also found stigma-reduction efforts to be effective in changing people's knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors towards people with mental-health problems. The development and implementation of effective anti-stigma programs specifically designed for the workplace is, however, of high importance. First, while public efforts have returned mixed results, the development of tailored strategies targeting the workplace might prove a more promising route to stigma change, as awareness of public campaigns has often been found to be quite low. Thus, while public anti-stigma efforts target a greater part of the population, more people might be reached effectively via more targeted interventions (e.g. at work). Second, participation in anti-stigma programs, for example in the scope of personnel development, could be made mandatory in an organizational setting, whereas public stigma campaigns require people to participate voluntarily. Third, by nature, exposure to mass-media approaches to stigma change can be short in time, whereas workplace interventions can be more intensive in terms of length and information.\nOur review shows that workplace anti-stigma interventions can be particularly effective in changing employees' knowledge of mental disorders, as well as helping behavior, while results related to attitudinal change were mixed, but positive overall. In two studies, a spillover effect was identified, meaning that a change in one outcome measure (e.g. behavior) occurred even though the intervention exclusively targeted other outcomes (e.g. knowledge or attitudes). This implies that the three dimensions of stigma (knowledge, attitude, and behavior) might be interrelated, as has been suggested before. The theory of health education postulates that attitude mediates the relationship between knowledge and behavior. In contrast, the current review showed that attitudinal change is not required to achieve behavioral change. In line with prior research, three studies found that knowledge might directly trigger a behavior under certain conditions, even without any attitudinal change. However, further research into how anti-stigma interventions change or affect each of the three dimensions of stigma is required to fully understand the stigmatization process.\nThe debilitating impact of mental illness at work is widely recognized, and organizations are increasingly investing in workplace mental-health interventions. However, emerging evidence indicates that stigma towards mental illness, in part, contributes to the underutilization of costly mental-health services (e.g. EAP, workplace counseling) that are already offered by organizations. It is, therefore, important to address and remove stigma as a barrier to increase the effectiveness and 'value-for-money' of these interventions.\nThis review addresses the research gap regarding the behavioral dimension of stigma as an outcome and, more importantly, highlights that workplace anti-stigma interventions have the potential to change employee behavior. In contrast, anti-stigma campaigns targeting the general public have often failed to change behavior. Perhaps in an organizational context as compared to the public context, behavioral change (e.g. in supportive or help-seeking behavior) could be achieved more readily by giving clear calls for action in specific situations at work. This has important practical implications for organizations and employers alike, as behavioral change is considered the ultimate goal of efforts to reduce stigma and is likely to result in a more supportive work environment, which, in turn, is a necessary prerequisite for the success of any mental-health intervention (e.g. workplace counseling, EAP).\nIn light of the impact of stigma on seeking help and accounting for the fact that a large proportion of people experiencing mental-health problems do not seek help, it is essential to measure the impact of anti-stigma interventions on help-seeking behavior. Despite the heterogeneity in the operationalization of behavior, however, none of the included studies examined help-seeking behavior as an outcome, focusing instead on potential intervention effects on participants' supportive behavior towards afflicted individuals. Future evaluations of workplace anti-stigma interventions should place stronger emphasis on assessing a potential impact on employees' help-seeking behavior (e.g. health-service utilization), as well as on their mental health (e.g. sick leave, presenteeism). This would help assess the cost-effectiveness of workplace anti-stigma interventions and strengthen the economic incentive for organizations to invest in stigma-reduction efforts.\nThe current review found some evidence indicating the positive impact of anti-stigma interventions on participants' general mental health. Improved knowledge of signs of mental illness and treatment options may lead employees to seek help earlier. This is supported by findings of a prior meta-analysis, which found that MHFA training helped improve participant mental health by improving self-recognition, increasing insight into one's own and others' mental well-being, and by increasing coping skills. Workplace anti-stigma interventions might not only create a more supportive work environment by reducing stigmatizing attitudes and discrimination, but also lead to improved knowledge and awareness of mental illness and to improved employee mental health via increased and potentially earlier help-seeking. So far, economic evaluations of anti-stigma interventions are generally lacking; however, preliminary evidence indicates a potential return on investment for employers.\nWhile the evaluated anti-stigma interventions themselves seem to be scientifically sound in terms of their theoretical background and content, the evaluation methods used need to be improved substantially. A prominent finding of this review was the large number of studies with methodological shortcomings, high risk of bias, no control groups, and small sample sizes. Studies frequently also reported high levels of dropouts and varied in terms of program completion. A potential reason for this might be the challenge of evaluating interventions in a scientifically sound manner in companies which might be unwilling to engage in such research or pose restrictions due to data-protection rights.\nThe current review further highlights a misfit between what some intervention studies claimed to target and what they actually assessed in terms of outcomes. If studies fail to assess the impact on outcomes they claim to target in their intervention, important evaluation data gets lost. Studies targeting and assessing a change in only one dimension of stigma (e.g. attitude) might fail to detect a spillover effect on other dimensions of stigma (e.g. knowledge or behavior).\nPrevious research has questioned the retention of intervention effects over time, especially with regards to attitudinal and behavioral change. The majority of studies in this review did not conduct a follow-up assessment of intervention effects. However, where reported, improvements in knowledge, attitudes, and behavior were maintained over time. Future research needs to place greater emphasis on conducting follow-up evaluations that go beyond pre-post measurements.\nLimitations\nAlthough this review generated important findings, there are several limitations that should be mentioned. First, only three electronic databases were used to gather articles for this review, and a search in languages other than English, German, Portuguese, and Spanish was not undertaken. Despite the lack of breadth, the searches were supplemented by searching Google Scholar, checking references, and communication with experts, which yielded 14 further studies, three of which were unpublished. The possibility of publication bias needs to be considered, as there may have been relevant studies that did not produce positive results and, consequently, were not published.\nA second limitation of the current review involves generalizability of the current findings. The majority of participants in the reviewed studies were well-educated employees, such as managers. This limits the generalizability of the findings to other occupations or sectors that employ less-educated workers (e.g. service industries). While it makes sense to address managers due to their supervisory role and their importance in recognizing and dealing with signs of mental illness in subordinates, it may be just as important to target less-educated workers because there is some evidence indicating that less-educated compared to more-educated people are more likely to hold stigmatizing attitudes towards people with mental illnesses. It is also important to note that all of the studies included in this review were carried out in high-income countries and, therefore, the findings may not apply to low- and middle-income countries, where stigma towards mental illness might be particularly strong or prevailing.\nThis review provides a narrative synthesis of the evidence of anti-stigma intervention effectiveness rather than a meta-analysis of results, which limits the strength of the conclusions that can be drawn. Given the heterogeneity of the methodology and outcome data across studies, it was not possible to conduct a meta-analysis at this time.\nImplications for future research\nIt was beyond the scope of the current review to identify which types or components of anti-stigma interventions are particularly effective in improving employees' knowledge, attitudes, and behavior. Future research should compare and contrast different types of anti-stigma interventions to determine the optimal program content and duration for the workplace context. Although a positive impact was found in all types of anti-stigma interventions studied, it is crucial to emphasize a stronger evaluation methodology as much as improving anti-stigma content.\nFuture research in this field should engage in more standardized, high-quality evaluations which measure all dimensions of stigma towards mental illness to better understand the potential impact of anti-stigma interventions at the workplace. This would allow researchers to compare quantitative measures of stigma across studies more easily and to conduct a meta-analysis which would help build a stronger evidence base for the effectiveness of workplace anti-stigma interventions.\nTo increase the generalizability of the current findings, anti-stigma interventions with larger, more diverse samples in terms of gender, race, socioeconomic status, education/hierarchy, geographic location, and type of workplace should be tested.\nConclusions\nThis review systematically examined the effectiveness of interventions targeting stigma towards mental illness at the workplace. There is tentative evidence that workplace anti-stigma interventions can have a positive impact on employees' knowledge, attitudes, and supportive behavior towards people with mental illness. The quality of evidence varied across studies, highlighting the need for more rigorous, higher-quality evaluations conducted with more diverse samples of the working population.\nFuture research needs to explore to what extent changes in employees' knowledge, attitudes, and supportive behavior translate into increased and earlier help-seeking by affected individuals. Such investigation is likely to inform important stakeholders, like human-resources or health-management personnel, about the beneficial impact of stigma-reduction programs on the effectiveness or acceptance of already existing mental-health interventions and, ultimately, on employee mental health.\nAdditional files\nAbbreviations\nPTSD\nposttraumatic stress disorder\nEAP\nemployee assistance program\nRCT\nrandomized controlled trial\nMHFA\nmental health first aid\nTRiM\ntrauma risk management\nCIT\ncrisis intervention training\nCompeting interest\nThe authors declare that they have no competing interest.\nAuthors' contributions\nSH performed the literature search, reviewed the abstracts and full texts, assessed the study quality, and drafted the manuscript.

MH-Guru), or a Wait List Control condition.\n\n Participants completed online surveys at baseline, 1 week post-intervention and at 6-month follow-up.\n\n Primary outcome measures included depression and anxiety literacy, personal stigma about depression and anxiety, and help seeking intentions for anxiety and depression at post-test.\n\n Secondary measures included help-seeking attitudes and self-reported help seeking behaviour.\n\n Satisfaction measures were also collected.\n\n\nResults\nDropout at post intervention was 26.7% and 21.0% for the MH-Guru and Control conditions respectively.\n\n Relative to Control, MH-Guru participants showed significantly greater improvements in depression and anxiety literacy at post intervention.\n\n Between group standardized effect sizes at post-test and 6-months were 0.78 and 0.81 for depression literacy and 0.80 and 0.79 for anxiety literacy.\n\n Compared to the Control participants, the MH-Guru group also showed significantly greater reductions in depression and anxiety personal stigma.\n\n Between group effect sizes in stigma for depression were ? 0.56 and ? 0.47 at post-test and 6-months respectively and ? 0.42 at both time points for anxiety.\n\n The MH-Guru intervention was not associated with a differentially greater increase in anxiety or depression help-seeking intentions or improvement in help seeking attitudes compared to the Control group.\n\n However, self-reported help-seeking behaviour was significantly greater in the MH-Guru group at post-test.\n\n In addition, the MH-Guru group showed greater intentions to seek help for depression from the Internet at 6-month follow-up.\n\n Satisfaction items suggested that the program was acceptable to employees.\n\n\nConclusions\nBrief online programs such as MH-Guru have the potential to play an important role in increasing mental health awareness and decreasing stigmatizing attitudes in the workplace, and by extension the general community.\n\n\n","id":"PMC6096203","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Elsevier","authors":[{"firstname":"Kathleen M","surname":"Griffiths","email":"kathy.griffiths@anu.edu.au","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Kylie","surname":"Bennett","email":"kylie.bennett@anu.edu.au","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Jennie","surname":"Walker","email":"jennie.walker@anu.edu.au","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Susan","surname":"Goldsmid","email":"susan.goldsmid@aic.gov.au","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Anthony","surname":"Bennett","email":"anthony.bennett@anu.edu.au","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"10.1007/s00127-017-1341-9","date":"2017-01-10","title":"Interventions to reduce discrimination and stigma: the state of the art","abstract":"Background\nThere is a rich literature on the nature of mental health-related stigma and the processes by which it severely affects the life chances of people with mental health problems.\n\n However, applying this knowledge to deliver and evaluate interventions to reduce discrimination and stigma in a lasting way is a complex and long-term challenge.\n\n\nMethods\nWe conducted a narrative synthesis of systematic reviews published since 2012, and supplemented this with papers published subsequently as examples of more recent work.\n\n\nResults\nThere is evidence for small to moderate positive impacts of both mass media campaigns and interventions for target groups in terms of stigma-related knowledge, attitudes, and intended behaviour in terms of desire for contact.\n\n However, the limited evidence from longer follow-up times suggests that it is not clear whether short-term contact interventions have a lasting impact.\n\n\nConclusions\nThe risk that short-term interventions may only have a short-term impact suggests a need to study longer term interventions and to use interim process and outcome data to improve interventions along the way.\n\n There is scope for more thorough application of intergroup contact theory whenever contact is used and of evidence-based teaching and assessment methods when skills training is used for target groups.\n\n\n","id":"PMC5344948","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Springer Berlin Heidelberg","authors":[{"firstname":"Petra C.","surname":"Gronholm","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Claire","surname":"Henderson","email":"Claire.1.Henderson@kcl.ac.uk","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Tanya","surname":"Deb","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Tanya","surname":"Deb","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Graham","surname":"Thornicroft","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1097/NMD.0000000000000423","date":"1970-01-01","title":"A &quot;Mental-Health-at-the-Workplace&quot;

Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) Statement on the Quality of Published Systematic Review and Meta-Analyses","abstract":"Introduction\nPRISMA statement was published in 2009 in order to set standards in the reporting of systematic reviews and meta-analyses.\n\n Our aim was to evaluate the impact of PRISMA endorsement on the quality of reporting and methodological quality of systematic reviews and meta-analyses, published in journals in the field of gastroenterology and hepatology (GH).\n\n\nMethods\nQuality of reporting and methodological quality were evaluated by assessing the adherence of papers to PRISMA checklist and AMSTAR quality scale.\n\n After identifying the GH journals which endorsed PRISMA in instructions for authors (IA), we appraised: 15 papers published in 2012 explicitly mentioning PRISMA in the full text (Group A); 15 papers from the same journals published in 2012 not explicitly mentioning PRISMA in the full text (Group B); 30 papers published the year preceding PRISMA endorsement from the same journals as above (Group C); 30 papers published in 2012 on the 10 highest impact factor journals in GH which not endorsed PRISMA (Group D).\n\n\nResults\nPRISMA statement was referred in the IA in 9 out of 70 GH journals (12.9%).\n\n We found significant increase in overall adherence to PRISMA checklist (Group A, 90.1%; Group C, 83.1%; p?=?0.003) and compliance to AMSTAR scale (Group A, 85.0%; Group C, 74.6%; p?=?0.002), following the PRISMA endorsement from the nine GH journals.\n\n Explicit referencing of PRISMA in manuscript was not associated with increase in quality of reporting and methodological quality (Group A vs.\n\n B, p?=?0.651, p?=?0.900, respectively).\n\n Adherence to PRISMA checklist, and the compliance with AMSTAR were significantly higher in journals endorsing PRISMA compared to those not (Groups A+B vs.\n\n D; p?=?0.003 and p?=?0.016, respectively).\n\n\nConclusion\nThe endorsement of PRISMA resulted in increase of both quality of reporting and methodological quality.\n\n It is advised that an increasing number of medical journals include PRISMA in the instructions for authors.\n\n\n","id":"PMC3873291","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Public Library of

and meta-analyses published in nursing journals: a cross-sectional study","abstract":"Objective\nSystematic reviews (SRs) often poorly report key information, thereby diminishing their usefulness.\n\n Previous studies evaluated published SRs and determined that they failed to meet explicit criteria or characteristics.\n\n The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement was recommended as a reporting guideline for SR and meta-analysis (MA), but previous studies showed that adherence to the statement was not high for SRs published in different medical fields.\n\n Thus, the aims of this study are twofold: (1) to investigate the number of nursing journals that have required or recommended the use of the PRISMA statement for reporting SR, and (2) to examine the adherence of SRs and/or meta-analyses to the PRISMA statement published in nursing journals.\n\n\nDesign\nA cross-sectional study.\n\n\nMethods\nNursing journals listed in the ISI journal citation report were divided into 2 groups based on the recommendation of PRISMA statement in their Instruction for Authors.\n\n SRs and meta-analyses published in 2014 were searched in 3 databases.\n\n 37 SRs and meta-analyses were randomly selected in each group.\n\n The adherence of each item to the PRISMA was examined and summarised using descriptive statistics.\n\n The quality of the SRs was assessed by Assessing the Methodological Quality of Systematic Reviews.\n\n The differences between the 2 groups were compared using the Mann-Whitney U test.\n\n\nResults\nOut of 107 nursing journals, 30 (28.0%) recommended or required authors to follow the PRISMA statement when they submit SRs or meta-analyses.\n\n The median rates of adherence to the PRISMA statement for reviews published in journals with and without PRISMA endorsement were 64.9% (IQR: 17.692.3%) and 73.0% (IQR: 59.594.6%), respectively.\n\n No significant difference was observed in any of the items between the 2 groups.\n\n\nConclusions\nThe median adherence of SRs and meta-analyses in nursing journals to PRISMA is low at 64.9% and 73.0%, respectively.\n\n Nonetheless, the adherence level of nursing journals to the PRISMA statement does not significantly vary whether they endorse or recommend such a guideline.\n\n\n","id":"PMC5306529","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"BMJ Publishing

Items of Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses) Statement was published to help authors improve how they report systematic reviews.\n\n It is unknown how many journals mention PRISMA in their instructions to authors, or whether stronger journal language regarding use of PRISMA improves author compliance.\n\n\nMethodology/Principal Findings\nAn Internet-based investigation examined the extent to which 146 leading medical journals have incorporated the PRISMA Statement into their instructions to authors.\n\n Results were analyzed using descriptive statistics.\n\n Also, systematic reviews published in the leading anesthesiology journals and the QUOROM (QUality Of Reporting Of Meta-analyses) Statement were used to explore the hypothesis that indicating compliance with the QUOROM Statement in the manuscript is associated with improved compliance with the reporting guideline.\n\n In a sample of 146 journals publishing systematic reviews, the PRISMA Statement was referred to in the instructions to authors for 27% (40/146) of journals; more often in general and internal medicine journals (7/14; 50%) than in specialty medicine journals (33/132; 25%).\n\n In the second part of the study, 13 systematic reviews published in the leading anesthesiology journals in 2008 were included for appraisal.\n\n Mention of the QUOROM Statement in the manuscript was associated with higher compliance with the QUOROM checklist (P?=?0.022).\n\n\nConclusions/Significance\nMost of the leading medical journals used ambiguous language regarding what was expected of authors.\n\n Further improvement on quality of reporting of systematic reviews may entail journals clearly informing authors of their requirements.\n\n Stronger directions, such as requiring an indication of adherence to a research quality of reporting statement in the manuscript, may improve reporting and utility of systematic reviews.\n\n\n","id":"PMC3217994","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Public

unemployment in people with mental illness or mental health issues: position paper and future directions","abstract":"Background\nAs yet, little is known about the effects of mental health stigma on sustainable employment.\n\n This is surprising, as mental health stigma is common, and because people with severe and common mental disorders are 7 and 3 times more likely to be unemployed, respectively, than people with no disorders.\n\n As the global lifetime prevalence of mental disorders is 29%, the high unemployment rates of people with these health problems constitute an important and urgent public health inequality problem that needs to be addressed.\n\n\nMain text\nThe aim of this position paper is to illustrate the assumption that stigma contributes to the unemployment of people with mental illness and mental health issues with evidence from recent scientific studies on four problem areas, and to provide directions for future research.\n\n These four problem areas indicate that: (1) employers and line managers hold negative attitudes towards people with mental illness or mental health issues, which decreases the chances of people with these health problems being hired or supported; (2) both the disclosure and non-disclosure of mental illness or mental health issues can lead to job loss; (3) anticipated discrimination, self-stigma and the Why Try effect can lead to insufficient motivation and effort to keep or find employment and can result in unemployment; and (4) stigma is a barrier to seeking healthcare, which can lead to untreated and worsened health conditions and subsequently to adverse occupational outcomes (e.\n\ng.\n\n sick leave, job loss).\n\n\nConclusions\nThe paper concludes that stigma in the work context is a considerable and complex problem, and that there is an important knowledge gap especially regarding the long-term effects of stigma on unemployment.\n\n To prevent and decrease adverse occupational outcomes in people with mental illness or mental health issues there is an urgent need for high quality and longitudinal research on stigma related consequences for employment.\n\n In addition, more validated measures specifically for the employment setting, as well as destigmatizing intervention studies are needed.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7171845","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"BioMed

approach","abstract":"Background\nMental health problems are prevalent and costly in working populations.\n\n Workplace interventions to address common mental health problems have evolved relatively independently along three main threads or disciplinary traditions: medicine, public health, and psychology.\n\n In this Debate piece, we argue that these three threads need to be integrated to optimise the prevention of mental health problems in working populations.\n\n\nDiscussion\nTo realise the greatest population mental health benefits, workplace mental health intervention needs to comprehensively 1) protect mental health by reducing workrelated risk factors for mental health problems; 2) promote mental health by developing the positive aspects of work as well as worker strengths and positive capacities; and 3) address mental health problems among working people regardless of cause.\n\n We outline the evidence supporting such an integrated intervention approach and consider the research agenda and policy developments needed to move towards this goal, and propose the notion of integrated workplace mental health literacy.\n\n\nSummary\nAn integrated approach to workplace mental health combines the strengths of medicine, public health, and psychology, and has the potential to optimise both the prevention and management of mental health problems in the workplace.\n\n\n","id":"PMC4024273","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"BioMed Central","authors":[{"firstname":"Anthony

managers' confidence to support the mental health of workers","abstract":"Background\nIn recognition of the important role managers play in the well-being of the staff they supervise, many workplaces are implementing specialised training for leaders to help them better understand and support the mental health needs of their staff.\n\n This training can be delivered through face-to-face or online training sessions.\n\n Evaluation of such programs have found positive results for each format when compared to a control group, but to date, face-to-face and online manager mental health training have not been compared with one another.\n\n\nAims\nThis study brings together results from two trials evaluating the same program content, each employing a different mode of content delivery.\n\n Both types of training aimed to change managers' confidence to better support the mental health needs of the staff they supervise.\n\n\nMethods\nUtilising data derived from two previously conducted trials, mean change in manager confidence from baseline at both post-intervention and follow-up were examined for each method of content delivery.\n\n An identical way of measuring confidence was used in each study.\n\n\nResults\nManagers' confidence improved from baseline with both methods of training.\n\n A greater change was observed with face-to-face training than for online, although both methods had sustained improvement over time.\n\n Analyses indicate that at follow-up, improvements in confidence were significant for both face-to-face (t18?=?5.99; P?&lt;?.\n\n001) and online training (t39?=?3.85; P?&lt;?.\n\n001).\n\n Analyses focused on managers who fully completed either type of training indicated very similar impacts for face-to-face and online training.\n\n\nConclusions\nBoth face-to-face and online delivery of manager mental health training can significantly improve managers confidence in supporting the mental health needs of their staff.\n\n This change is sustained over various follow-up periods.\n\n However, lower retention rates common in online training reduce the relative effect of this method of delivery.\n\n\n","id":"PMC6926278","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Elsevier","authors":[{"firstname":"Aimée","surname":"Gayed","email":"a.gayed@unsw.edu.au","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Leona","surname":"Tan","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Anthony

at the workplace: a systematic review","abstract":"Background\nThe majority of people experiencing mental-health problems do not seek help, and the stigma of mental illness is considered a major barrier to seeking appropriate treatment.\n\n More targeted interventions (e.\n\ng.\n\n at the workplace) seem to be a promising and necessary supplement to public campaigns, but little is known about their effectiveness.\n\n The aim of this systematic review is to provide an overview of the evidence on the effectiveness of interventions targeting the stigma of mental illness at the workplace.\n\n\nMethods\nSixteen studies were included after the literature review.\n\n The effectiveness of anti-stigma interventions at the workplace was assessed by examining changes in: (1) knowledge of mental disorders and their treatment and recognition of signs/symptoms of mental illness, (2) attitudes towards people with mental-health problems, and (3) supportive behavior.\n\n\nResults\nThe results indicate that anti-stigma interventions at the workplace can lead to improved employee knowledge and supportive behavior towards people with mental-health problems.\n\n The effects of interventions on employees attitudes were mixed, but generally positive.\n\n The quality of evidence varied across studies.\n\n\nConclusions\nThis highlights the need for more rigorous, higher-quality evaluations conducted with more diverse samples of the working population.\n\n Future research should explore to what extent changes in employees knowledge, attitudes,

Health Promotion and Intervention in Occupational Settings: Protocol for a Pilot Study of the MENTUPP Intervention","abstract":"Depression and anxiety are the most prevalent mental health difficulties in the EU, causing immense suffering and costing the global economy EUR 1 trillion each year in lost productivity.\n Employees in construction, health and information and communications technology have an elevated risk of mental health difficulties.\n Most mental health interventions for the workplace have been targeted at larger companies and small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are often overlooked despite most people being employed in SMEs.\n The MENTUPP intervention aims to improve mental health and wellbeing and reduce depression, anxiety, and suicidal behaviour.\n The MENTUPP project involves the development, implementation, and evaluation of a multilevel intervention targeting both clinical and non-clinical mental health issues and combating the stigma of mental (ill-)health, with a specific focus on SMEs.\n The intervention is underpinned by a framework of how to create a mentally healthy workplace by employing an integrated approach and has been informed by several systematic reviews designed to understand organisational mental health interventions and a consultation survey with key experts in the area.\n The intervention is facilitated through the MENTUPP Hub, an online platform that presents interactive psychoeducational materials, toolkits, and links to additional resources in an accessible and user-friendly manner.\n This paper presents the pilot study protocol for delivering the MENTUPP intervention in eight European countries and Australia.\n Each intervention country will aim to recruit at least 23 participants in 13 SMEs in one of the three high-risk sectors.\n The central aim of the pilot study will be to examine the feasibility, acceptability, and uptake of the MENTUPP intervention across the target SMEs.\n The findings will contribute to devising the protocol for a cluster randomised controlled trial (cRCT) of the MENTUPP intervention.\n Findings from this study will also be used to inform the optimisation phase of the MENTUPP intervention which will aim to improve the materials and the implementation of the intervention as well as enhancing the evaluation strategy which will be employed for the cRCT.\n","id":"PMC8775639","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"MDPI","authors":[{"firstname":"Ella","surname":"Arensman","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Cliodhna","surname":"OConnor","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Caleb","surname":"Leduc","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Eve","surname":"Griffin","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Eve","surname":"Griffin","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Grace","surname":"Cully","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Grace","surname":"Cully","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Doireann","surname":"Ní

in substantial economic costs to the workplace through lost productivity.\n\n The internet offers an unparalleled opportunity for the large scale, cost-effective delivery of mental health awareness and destigmatisation programs in the workplace.\n\n However, to date high quality assessments of the effectiveness of such workplace programs have been confined to health professional settings.\n\n The current study reports the effectiveness of Mental Health Guru (MH-Guru), a two-module online mental health workplace induction program.\n\n\nMethods\nA total of 507 employees from a large multi-departmental government workplace were randomised to a 2-week online depression and anxiety educational program (Mental Health Guru; MH-Guru), or a Wait List Control condition.\n\n Participants completed online surveys at baseline, 1 week post-intervention and at 6-month follow-up.\n\n Primary outcome measures included depression and anxiety literacy, personal stigma about depression and anxiety, and help seeking intentions for anxiety and depression at post-test.\n\n Secondary measures included help-seeking attitudes and self-reported help seeking behaviour.\n\n Satisfaction measures were also collected.\n\n\nResults\nDropout at post intervention was 26.7% and 21.0% for the MH-Guru and Control conditions respectively.\n\n Relative to Control, MH-Guru participants showed significantly greater improvements in depression and anxiety literacy at post intervention.\n\n Between group standardized effect sizes at post-test and 6-months were 0.78 and 0.81 for depression literacy and 0.80 and 0.79 for anxiety literacy.\n\n Compared to the Control participants, the MH-Guru group also showed significantly greater reductions in depression and anxiety personal stigma.\n\n Between group effect sizes in stigma for depression were ? 0.56 and ? 0.47 at post-test and 6-months respectively and ? 0.42 at both time points for anxiety.\n\n The MH-Guru intervention was not associated with a differentially greater increase in anxiety or depression help-seeking intentions or improvement in help seeking attitudes compared to the Control group.\n\n However, self-reported help-seeking behaviour was significantly greater in the MH-Guru group at post-test.\n\n In addition, the MH-Guru group showed greater intentions to seek help for depression from the Internet at 6-month follow-up.\n\n Satisfaction items suggested that the program was acceptable to employees.\n\n\nConclusions\nBrief online programs such as MH-Guru have the potential to play an important role in increasing mental health awareness and decreasing stigmatizing attitudes in the workplace, and by extension the general community.\n\n\n","id":"PMC6096203","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Elsevier","authors":[{"firstname":"Kathleen

However, those services are often underused, which, to a great extent, can be attributed to fear of stigmatization.\n\n Nevertheless, so far only a few workplace interventions have specifically targeted stigma, and evidence on their effectiveness is limited.\n\n\nObjective\nThe objective of this study was to develop and evaluate a digital game-based training program for managers to promote employee mental health and reduce mental illness stigma at work.\n\n\nMethods\nWe describe the empirical development of Leadership Training in Mental Health Promotion (LMHP), a digital game-based training program for leaders.\n\n A 1-group pre-post design and a 3-month follow-up were used for training evaluation.\n\n We applied multilevel growth models to investigate change over time in the dependent variables knowledge, attitudes, self-efficacy, and intentions to promote employee mental health in 48 managers of a global enterprise in the United Kingdom.\n\n Participants were mainly male (44/48, 92%) and ranged in age from 32 to 58 (mean 46.0, SD 7.2) years.\n\n\nResults\nWe found a positive impact of the Web-based training program on managers knowledge of mental health and mental illness (P&lt;.\n\n001), on attitudes toward people with mental health problems (P&lt;.\n\n01), and on their self-efficacy to deal with mental health situations at work (P&lt;.\n\n001), with the exception of intentions to promote employee mental health, which was initially high.\n\n\nConclusions\nResults provide first evidence of the effectiveness of LMHP to positively affect managers skills to promote employee mental health at work.\n\n Furthermore, the high rate of participation in LMHP (48/54, 89%) supports the use of digital game-based interventions to increase user engagement and

develop prejudices and discriminatory attitudes towards people with mental health problems in a very similar way to the rest of the population.\n The main objective of this project was to design, implement and evaluate two awareness-raising interventions respectively tailored to reduce stigmatising beliefs and attitudes towards persons with a mental health diagnosis among primary care (PC) and mental health (MH) professionals.\n These interventions were developed by Obertament, the Catalan alliance against stigma and discrimination in mental health.\n Activists from this organisation with lived experience of mental health diagnosis carried out awareness-raising interventions in PC and MH health centres.\n The Targeted, Local, Credible, Continuous Contact (TLC3) methodology was adapted to the Catalan healthcare context.\n The efficacy of these interventions was evaluated using two prospective double-blind cluster-randomised-controlled trials.\n Stigmatizing beliefs and behaviours were measured with the Opening Minds Stigma Scale for Health Care Providers in PC centres and with the Beliefs and Attitudes towards Mental Health Service users rights in MH centres.\n Reductions in both PC and MH professionals stigmatising beliefs and attitudes were found in the 1-month follow-up, although a rebound effect at the 3-month follow up was detected.\n This emphasizes the importance of the continuity of the presence of anti-stigma activities and messages.\n Attrition rates were high, which can hamper the reliability of the results.\n Further follow-up studies should

A Randomized Controlled Trial with a Six-Month and Two-Year Follow-Up","abstract":"Background\nAccording to a recent report from the European Brain Council and the European Colleague of Neuropsychopharmacology the one year prevalence of some kind of mental disorder is around 27% among the adult population in Europe.\n\n Research has shown a lack of mental health literacy in the population in general and it is thus important to find ways to improve the public's knowledge and skills to provide first hand support to people with mental disorders.\n\n Mental Health First Aid (MHFA) is a training program that has shown positive changes in knowledge and helping behavior.\n\n This study investigates if MHFA training in a Swedish context provides a sustained improvement in knowledge about mental disorders, a better ability to be helpful in contacts with people who are ill and if it changes attitudes in a positive direction.\n\n\nMethods and Findings\nThe introduction of the training program was made in accordance with the constructor's instructions.\n\n Participants were mainly public sector employees from a county in the west of Sweden.\n\n The study was a randomized controlled trial with an experiment group (n?=?199) and a control group (n?=?207) placed on a waiting list during a 6-month follow-up.\n\n A two-year follow-up was conducted for participants (n?=?155) from both the intervention and waiting list group who had completed the training and during the follow-up been in contact with persons with mental disorders.\n\n The intervention group improved in knowledge as well as in confidence in providing help for someone in need.\n\n The two-year follow-up showed that the improvements were to a great extent maintained.\n\n\nConclusions\nMental Health First Aid might raise the level of awareness of mental disorders and have an influence on the number of people who can receive professional treatment for their problems.\n\n\n","id":"PMC4071003","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Public Library of

Health and Proactive Psychological Protection in Public Safety Personnel","abstract":"Public safety personnel (PSP; e.\ng.\n, communications officials, corrections workers, firefighters, paramedics, and police officers) are at risk of developing mental health problems due to experiencing potentially psychologically traumatic events during their career.\n Research examining evidence-based treatments for psychological injuries resulting from operational duties (also known as operational stress injuries) has not yielded robust results that would indicate ongoing interventions as the best solution for managing PSP mental health injuries; as such, proactive psychological interventions designed to bolster resilience are being considered potentially beneficial for mitigating the impact of occupational stress on PSP.\n Despite the growing popularity of resilience programs, most are delivered in a single session after an event deemed particularly problematic with no follow-up.\n Longer interventions may better support sustained resiliency, mitigate the impact of operational stress, and increase positive PSP workplace outcomes.\n The current article introduces the Before Operational Stress (BOS) program, which was designed for delivery early in a PSP career to enhance self-awareness and healthy relationships.\n The year-long program is derived from cognitive behavior therapy and group therapeutic techniques to meet program objectives.\n The current BOS program evaluation demonstrated small, statistically significant improvements in symptoms of PTSD, quality of life, stigma, and perceived social support from baseline (Time 1) to 6 months (Time 4).\n There were also non-significant improvements observed in symptoms of depression, anxiety, stress, alcohol use, as well as in emotional regulation and resilience.\n Qualitative results indicated participants positively perceived the BOS program, with participants reporting specific improvements in self-awareness, avoidant behaviors, and relationships with family and colleagues.\n The BOS program content (e.\ng.\n, functional disconnection and functional reconnection) and processes (e.\ng.\n, psychoeducation within a supportive learning structure; mutually empowering group interactions) appear unique relative to other PSP resilience programs, with promising initial results in support of PSP mental health.\n

training (eLearning plus face-to-face course delivery), implemented in an Australian public sector workplace, were more effective than a control intervention at 1-year and 2-year follow-up, and whether blended MHFA training was more effective than eLearning alone.\n\n\nMaterial and methods\nAustralian public servants (n = 608 at baseline) were randomly assigned to complete an eLearning MHFA course, a blended MHFA course or Red Cross eLearning Provide First Aid (PFA) (the control) and completed online questionnaires pre- and post-training and one and two years later (n = 289, n = 272, n = 243 at post, 1- and 2-year follow-up respectively).\n\n The questionnaires were based on vignettes describing a person with depression or post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).\n\n Primary

psychological distress.\n\n\nResults\nAt 1-year follow-up, both eLearning and blended courses produced greater improvements than PFA training in knowledge, confidence and intentions to help a person with depression or PTSD, beliefs about dangerousness and desire for social distance.\n\n At 2-year follow-up, some of these improvements were maintained, particularly those relating to knowledge and

among males in the Australian construction industry.\n The program delivers early intervention training and support to construction workers.\n This mixed-methods study aimed to (1) examine the effectiveness of training for MATES connectors and (2) examine the barriers, motivations and pathways to help-seeking and help-offering for both MATES connectors and clients.\n A total of 104 volunteers completed a short survey before and after connector training sessions.\n Quantitative data analysis showed significant increases in connectors self-reported suicide awareness, and willingness to offer help to workmates and seek help themselves.\n For the qualitative component, 27 connectors and clients participated in focus groups and individual interviews.\n Thematic analysis identified six themes from the connectors data: awareness, skills and confidence; removing stigma; making a difference; simplicity of the model; understanding the industry; and visibility, camaraderie and passion.\n For clients, three key themes emerged: barriers and pathways to help-seeking; speaking the same language; and flow-on effects.\n The results provide evidence for the effectiveness of connector training and indicate that MATESs peer support model is enabling workers to overcome traditional barriers and attitudes to seeking and offering help.\n","id":"PMC6720173","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"MDPI","authors":[{"firstname":"Victoria","surname":"Ross","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Neil","surname":"Caton","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Jorgen","surname":"Gullestrup","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jorgen","surname":"Gullestrup","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Kairi","surname":"Kõlves","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"}]}]},{"doi":"10.5463/sra.v1i1.20","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Self

either participate immediately in a course or to be wait-listed for 5 months before undertaking the training.\n\n The participants were employees in two large government departments in Canberra, Australia, where the courses were conducted during participants' work time.\n\n Data were analyzed according to an intention-to-treat approach.\n\n\nResults\nThe trial found a number of benefits from this training course, including greater confidence in providing help to others, greater likelihood of advising people to seek professional help, improved concordance with health professionals about

A Randomized Controlled Trial with a Six-Month and Two-Year Follow-Up","abstract":"Background\nAccording to a recent report from the European Brain Council and the European Colleague of Neuropsychopharmacology the one year prevalence of some kind of mental disorder is around 27% among the adult population in Europe.\n\n Research has shown a lack of mental health literacy in the population in general and it is thus important to find ways to improve the public's knowledge and skills to provide first hand support to people with mental disorders.\n\n Mental Health First Aid (MHFA) is a training program that has shown positive changes in knowledge and helping behavior.\n\n This study investigates if MHFA training in a Swedish context provides a sustained improvement in knowledge about mental disorders, a better ability to be helpful in contacts with people who are ill and if it changes attitudes in a positive direction.\n\n\nMethods and Findings\nThe introduction of the training program was made in accordance with the constructor's instructions.\n\n Participants were mainly public sector employees from a county in the west of Sweden.\n\n The study was a randomized controlled trial with an experiment group (n?=?199) and a control group (n?=?207) placed on a waiting list during a 6-month follow-up.\n\n A two-year follow-up was conducted for participants (n?=?155) from both the intervention and waiting list group who had completed the training and during the follow-up been in contact with persons with mental disorders.\n\n The intervention group improved in knowledge as well as in confidence in providing help for someone in need.\n\n The two-year follow-up showed that the improvements were to a great extent maintained.\n\n\nConclusions\nMental Health First Aid might raise the level of awareness of mental disorders and have an influence on the number of people who can receive professional treatment for their problems.\n\n\n","id":"PMC4071003","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Public Library of

comparison of Australia and Japan","abstract":"Background\nSurveys of the public in a number of countries have shown poor recognition of mental disorders and beliefs about treatment that often diverge from those of health professionals.\n\n This lack of mental health literacy can limit the optimal use of treatment services.\n\n Australia and Japan are countries with very different mental health care systems, with Japan emphasising hospital care and Australia more oriented to community care.\n\n Japan is also more collectivist and Australia more individualist in values.\n\n These differences might influence recognition of disorders and beliefs about treatment in the two countries.\n\n\nMethods\nSurveys of the public were carried out in each country using as similar a methodology as feasible.\n\n In both countries, household interviews were carried out concerning beliefs in relation to one of four case vignettes, describing either depression, depression with suicidal thoughts, early schizophrenia or chronic schizophrenia.\n\n In Australia, the survey involved a national sample of 3998 adults aged 18 years or over.\n\n In Japan, the survey involved 2000 adults aged between 20 and 69 from 25 regional sites spread across the country.\n\n\nResults\nThe Japanese public were found to be more reluctant to use psychiatric labels, particularly for the depression cases.\n\n The Japanese were also more reluctant to discuss mental disorders with others outside the family.\n\n They had a strong belief in counsellors, but not in GPs.\n\n They generally believe in the benefits of treatment, but are not optimistic about full recovery.\n\n By contrast, Australians used psychiatric labels more often, particularly 'depression'.\n\n They were also more positive about the benefits of seeking professional help, but had a strong preference for lifestyle interventions and tended to be negative about some psychiatric medications.\n\n Australians were positive about both counsellors and GPs.\n\n Psychiatric hospitalization and ECT were seen negatively in both countries.\n\n\nConclusion\nThere are some major differences between Australia and Japan in recognition of disorders and beliefs about treatment.\n\n Some of these may relate to the different health care systems, but the increasing openness about mental health in Australia is also likely to be an explanatory factor.\n\n\n","id":"PMC1177951","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"BioMed Central","authors":[{"firstname":"Anthony

to provide initial assistance to students who are developing mental health problems.\n\n To improve the skills of teachers in this area, a Mental Health First Aid training course was modified to be suitable for high school teachers and evaluated in a cluster randomized trial.\n\n\nMethods\nThe trial was carried out with teachers in South Australian high schools.\n\n Teachers at 7 schools received training and those at another 7 were wait-listed for future training.\n\n The effects of the training on teachers were evaluated using questionnaires pre- and post-training and at 6 months follow-up.\n\n The questionnaires assessed mental health knowledge, stigmatizing attitudes, confidence in providing help to others, help actually provided, school policy and procedures, and teacher mental health.\n\n The indirect effects on students were evaluated using questionnaires at pre-training and at follow-up which assessed any mental health help and information received from school staff, and also the mental health of the student.\n\n\nResults\nThe training increased teachers' knowledge, changed beliefs about treatment to be more like those of mental health professionals, reduced some aspects of stigma, and increased confidence in providing help to students and colleagues.\n\n There was an indirect effect on students, who reported receiving more mental health information from school staff.\n\n Most of the changes found were sustained 6 months after training.\n\n However, no effects were found on teachers' individual support towards students with mental

is useful for members of the public to have some skills in how to assist people developing mental disorders.\n\n A Mental Health First Aid course has been developed to provide these skills.\n\n Two randomized controlled trials of this course have shown positive effects on participants' knowledge, attitudes and behavior.\n\n However, these trials have provided limited data on participants' subsequent experiences in providing first aid.\n\n To remedy this, a study was carried out gathering stories from participants in one of the trials, 1921 months post-training.\n\n\nMethods\nFormer course participants were contacted and sent a questionnaire either by post or via the internet.\n\n Responses were received from 94 out of the 131 trainees who were contacted.\n\n The questionnaire asked about whether the participant had experienced a post-training situation where someone appeared to have a mental health problem and, if so, asked questions about that experience.\n\n\nResults\nPost-training experiences were reported by 78% of respondents.\n\n Five key points emerged from the qualitative data: (1) the majority of respondents had had some direct experience of a situation where mental health issues were salient and the course enabled them to take steps that led to better effects than otherwise might have been the case; (2) positive effects were experienced in terms of increased empathy and confidence, as well as being better able to handle crises; (3) the positive effects were experienced by a wide range of people with varied expectations and needs; (4) there was no evidence of people over-reaching themselves because of over-confidence and (5) those who attended were able to identify quite specific benefits and many thought the course not only very useful, but were keen to see it repeated and extended.\n\n\nConclusion\nThe qualitative data confirm that most members of the public who receive Mental Health First Aid training subsequently provide support to people with mental health problems and that this support generally has positive effects.\n\n\n","id":"PMC1308824","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"BioMed Central","authors":[{"firstname":"Anthony

Aid (MHFA) training on attitudes to people with mental illness and on knowledge about mental disorders.\n\n Our hypotheses were that at the end of the training participants would have increased knowledge of mental disorders and their treatments, and decreased negative attitudes towards people with mental disorders.\n\n\nMethods\nRespondents were 114 participants in two-day MHFA training workshops for the Vietnamese community in Melbourne conducted by two qualified MHFA trainers.\n\n Participants completed the research questionnaire prior to the commencement of the training (pre-test) and at its completion (post-test).\n\n The questionnaires assessed negative attitudes towards people with mental illness (as described in four vignettes), ability to recognise the mental disorders described in the vignettes, and knowledge about how to assist someone with one of these disorders.\n\n Responses to open-ended questions were content analysed and coded.\n\n To evaluate the effect of the training, answers to the structured questions and to the coded open-ended questions given at pre- and post-test were compared using McNemar tests for dichotomous values and Wilcoxon tests for other scores.\n\n\nResults\nBetween pre- and post-test there was significant improvement in recognition of mental disorders; more targeted and appropriate mental health first aid responses, and reduction in inappropriate first aid responses; and negative attitudes to the people described in the vignettes declined significantly on many items of the stigma scale.\n\n\nConclusion\nA two-day, MHFA training course for general members of the Vietnamese community in Melbourne demonstrated significant reductions in stigmatising attitudes, improved knowledge of mental disorders and improved knowledge about appropriate forms of assistance to give to people in the community with mental disorder.\n\n There is sufficient evidence to scale up to a population level program for the Vietnamese community, and a need for longitudinal evaluation of such a scaled up program.\n\n\n","id":"PMC2745360","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"BioMed

with greater impact in rural communities.\n\n This paper reports on a project, Coach the Coach, in which Australian rural football clubs were the setting and football coaches the leaders in providing greater mental health awareness and capacity to support early help seeking behaviour among young males experiencing mental health difficulties, especially depression.\n\n Coaches and other football club leaders were provided with Mental Health First Aid (MHFA) training.\n\n\nMethod\nPre-post measures of the ability of those club leaders undertaking mental health training to recognise depression and schizophrenia and of their knowledge of evidence supported treatment options, and confidence in responding to mental health difficulties were obtained using a questionnaire.\n\n This was supplemented by focus group interviews.\n\n Pre-post questionnaire data from players in participating football clubs was used to investigate attitudes to depression, treatment options and ability to recognise depression from a clinical scenario.\n\n Key project stakeholders were also interviewed.\n\n\nResults\nClub leaders (n = 36) who were trained in MHFA and club players (n = 275) who were not trained, participated in this evaluation.\n\n More than 50% of club leaders who undertook the training showed increased capacity to recognise mental illness and 66% reported increased confidence to respond to mental health difficulties in others.\n\n They reported that this training built upon their existing skills, fulfilled their perceived social responsibilities and empowered them.\n\n Indirect benefit to club players from this approach seemed limited as minimal changes in attitudes were reported by players.\n\n Key stakeholders regarded the project as valuable.\n\n\nConclusions\nRural football clubs appear to be appropriate social structures to promote rural mental health awareness.\n\n Club leaders, including many coaches, benefit from MHFA training, reporting increased skills and confidence.\n\n Benefit to club players from this approach was less obvious.\n\n However, the generally positive findings of this study suggest further research in this area is desirable.\n\n\n","id":"PMC2889859","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"BioMed

Only six studies had tested their intervention against a control condition, two of which had used random allocation. Most frequently used interventions were lectures providing theoretical information. Many studies also used interactive methods (N = 9), discussed case studies (N = 8) or used role plays (N = 5). Three studies reported that they had used clinical practice and supervision. Results of these studies were mixed. No or little effects were found for brief training interventions (e.g. 1 h to 1 day). Longer training interventions with more sophisticated didactic methods produced statistically significant changes in validated stigma questionnaires. These results have to be interpreted with caution due to risk of bias. Methods for cultural adaptation of interventions were rarely documented.\nConclusions\nMore rigorous trials are needed in LMICs to test interventions that target discriminatory behaviours in relationship with patients. Cultural adaptation of stigma interventions and structural/institutional factors should be more explicitly addressed in such trials.\nIntroduction\nIn low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), the discrepancy between the high prevalence rates of mental disorders on the one hand, and limited availability of mental health services on the other hand, is well documented (Kessler et al.,; WHO,). As a response to this 'treatment gap' (Saxena et al.,), the World Health Organisation (WHO) launched the mental health Gap Action Programme (mhGAP, WHO,) which aims at scaling up services for mental, neurological and substance use disorders, particularly in LMICs. Integrating mental health into primary health care (PHC) is a key component of the mhGAP programme. By integrating mental health into PHC, people in need of treatment can access services easily and be transferred to specialised care if necessary (Funk et al.,). Additionally, the mhGAP programme supports training community health workers in taking on limited tasks in the care of people with mental illness, such as case detection, referral to PHC and providing psychosocial support (Keynejad et al.,).\nThis task-sharing approach (Patel,), in which care of people with mental illness is transferred from specialists to also involve primary care and community health workers, has been increasingly implemented in many LMICs over the past decade. WHO has developed an Intervention Guide (IG) for mental, neurological and substance use disorders in non-specialised health settings (WHO,) in order to support this task-sharing process. A recent systematic review compiled evidence on the practical implementation of the WHO mhGAP-IG in LMICs and showed promising results (Keynejad et al.,). Despite these efforts to enhance provision of mental health care in LMICs, and increasing evidence showing their positive results, many people with mental illness in LMICs still do not receive adequate treatment.\nMental health-related stigma is a key barrier to mental health care (Saxena et al.,). 'Stigma' can be conceptualised in terms of knowledge (i.e. ignorance or misinformation), attitude (i.e. prejudice) and behaviour (i.e. discrimination, violence, hostility and human rights abuses) (Thornicroft,). A systematic review revealed stigmatising beliefs, attitudes and discriminatory behaviours among primary and specialised health care professionals in both high-income countries (HICs) and LMICs (Henderson et al.,). Thus, even if people with mental illness overcome barriers and seek help in PHC, they are still at risk of being confronted with stigmatising beliefs, negative attitudes and discrimination, which hinders their right to adequate care.\nEmpirical evidence on how to reduce stigma in specific populations (e.g. health care workers) is generally scarce, as most studies merely assess stigma but do not test interventions to actually address it (Evans-Lacko et al.,). Studies in the general population showed that interventions containing social contact and first-person narratives were more effective than others (Mehta et al.,), a finding that could not be confirmed for health professionals (Henderson et al.,). Evidence from LMICs is particularly limited (Henderson et al.,; Mehta et al.,), especially when it comes to evidence on effective interventions, on how best to target key groups such as healthcare staff, or on how to culturally adapt interventions to local contexts (Semrau et al.,).\nStigma can be addressed in specific interventions with PHC staff, but ideally it is incorporated into training as an integral part of health and mental health education. In LMICs, in the context of implementing the mhGAP, professional health staff in primary care as well as lay community mental health workers is increasingly trained in the detection and evidence-based treatment of mental disorders. Stigma would ideally be integrated into these training sessions, but evidence is still lacking on how to address stigma in these settings. In a systematic review, Mehta et al. reviewed interventions to reduce mental health-related stigma among different populations. This review revealed three interventions targeting health professionals in LMICs, hence evidence is limited.\nPrevious systematic reviews also showed that outcome assessments to quantify the effectiveness of stigma interventions remain an empirical challenge. While knowledge and attitudes can be measured using questionnaires, discriminatory behaviours are more difficult to assess. In the systematic review by Henderson et al. among health care staff, little evidence was found on behavioural outcomes of stigma interventions, and none of these studies were conducted in LMICs. This lack of evidence might be explained by the fact that behavioural outcomes are ideally measured by asking patients about their experiences with health professionals, and such data are more difficult to collect than assessments of knowledge and attitudes. And finally, stigma is most likely shaped by culture (Yang et al.,; Yang et al.,). Systematic reviews show that cultural adaptation of psychological interventions increases their effectiveness (e.g. Harper Shehadeh et al.,), but this has not yet been tested for stigma interventions.\nIn summary, it is most relevant to better understand how mental health-related stigma can be addressed in trainings with health workers in the context of task-sharing approaches in LMICs. Previous reviews have not answered this question. The current study aims to close this gap by providing evidence on interventions for reducing mental health-related stigma among PHC workers in LMICs, with a primary focus on attitudes and behaviours. It therefore covers a small intersection of studies that were included in previous reviews (Henderson et al.,; Mehta et al.,; Semrau et al.,). A new search was run to also include studies that have been published since these previous reviews. Furthermore, by using a 'magnifying glass strategy', a closer look is taken on the content and didactic methods used in stigma interventions for PHC staff in LMICs, and on the cultural adaptation of such interventions. With this approach, the current review aims to highlight future directions for designing effective interventions, thereby contributing to enhancing the quality of mental health care in primary care settings in LMICs.\nData collection, extraction and analysis\nPreferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) diagram with a systematic search and selection process.\nThis study was listed in the PROSPERO register for systematic reviews (registration number CRD42017065436). Data collection included two different strategies. First, the existing systematic reviews on either stigma among PHC staff (Henderson et al.,; Mehta et al.,; Semrau et al.,) or training of PHC staff in LMICs (Liu et al.,; Keynejad et al.,) were searched for studies that met the inclusion criteria of the current review. Second, a new search was done, covering the time since the previous reviews, i.e. January 2013 to May 2017. The new search was run on 6 May 2017 and covered the following databases: PsycINFO, MEDLINE (Ovid), CINAHL, Social Sciences Citation Index and Cochrane (only Trials). Five search concepts were combined in order to capture relevant literature: stigma (e.g. stigma, discrimination or stereotype); mental health (e.g. depression, anxiety or schizophrenia); intervention (e.g. randomised controlled trial, evaluation or pre-post); PHC staff (e.g. general practitioners or health care workers) and LMICs classified according to the World Bank, using their names (e.g. Afghanistan) and population adjectives (e.g. Afghan). The search strategies were adapted from the previous reviews. The complete search strategy (only Medline) can be accessed in the online Supplementary Material. The PRISMA diagram showing the data collection process is given in Fig. 1. \nInclusion and exclusion criteria were defined along the participants, interventions, comparators and outcomes (PICO) approach. Participants in stigma interventions were PHC staff in LMICs (including non-professionals). The intervention had to be a mental health-related training programme addressing PHC workers' knowledge, attitudes and behaviours in terms of professional skills. Studies were excluded if they trained or evaluated knowledge and behaviour/skills only, without an attitudinal (stigma-related) component, or if they did not include a pre-training assessment. Accordingly, outcomes had to include an attitudinal assessment, aside from knowledge and/or skills. Both qualitative and quantitative studies were included, and no comparator was defined.\nThe included full-texts were introduced to the qualitative data analysis software MAXQDA (version 12.3.3). A coding system was developed including the following categories: stigma intervention content (e.g. theory, diagnostic skills, relationship skills), didactic methods (e.g. lecture, role plays, contact with patients), the mental disorder the intervention focused on (e.g. depression, psychosis), whether the intervention was culturally adapted, the type of outcome measure (e.g. validated or non-validated questionnaire, qualitative interviews, behavioural observation) and primary outcomes. The analysis of outcomes focused only on attitudes and behaviour, not on knowledge. Outcome measures regarding knowledge are very diverse and would provide results that are hardly comparable, and knowledge was not the main focus of the current review. Two raters coded the full-texts independently and discussed possible differences until finding an agreement. Additionally, we used a category system to critically appraise the methodological quality of the included studies considering the following five criteria: control group, random allocation, random sequence generation, allocation concealment and incomplete data. A meta-analysis was originally planned but could not be calculated for the reasons given below.\nResults\nSummary of included studies describing training with PHC workers\nReference	Country	Target population	N	Intervention: content (duration)	Design	Measure(s)	Main results (descriptive analysis)	 	Abayomi et al.

The studies were from 11 different countries and included a broad range of participants, such as nurses, general practitioners (GPs) or community mental health workers. Sample sizes ranged from lower than N  =  30 to N &gt; 200, with seven studies having sample sizes of N &gt; 100. Most studies (N  =  11) covered mental disorders in general, but some studies addressed one particular disorder, such as depression (N  =  4) and schizophrenia (N  =  2). \nThe majority of interventions (N  =  15) provided theoretical information, such as symptoms, prevalence and aetiology of mental disorders, relationship between the mental and physical health or social consequences of mental disorders. In seven studies, stigma was explicitly addressed in this theoretical introduction. As an example, Ucok et al. described their intervention as follows: 'the slide presentation lasted approximately 45 minutes and included current information on the course of schizophrenia and its treatment, the impact of stigma on schizophrenia, and description of GPs' roles' (p. 440).\nThe majority of the studies (N  =  11) covered the treatment of mental disorders, describing a variety of interventions, such as treatment guidelines, medication, counselling, referral to specialists, psychological first aid, problem-solving or interpersonal therapy. Of those studies, four reported that they had explicitly addressed the relationship with patients, e.g. promoting communication skills. As an example, Bradshaw et al. described that their community volunteers' education programme included 'examining interactions which may increase or reduce stress for the patient' (p. 100). A great number of studies (N  =  11) aimed at improving participants' diagnostic skills. Some interventions covered mental health policy (N  =  3), mental health promotion in communities and psychosocial interventions (N  =  3) and stress management (N  =  2).\nWith regards to didactic methods, the vast majority of studies provided lectures (N  =  12). Additionally, many studies used interactive methods (N  =  9), discussed case studies (N  =  8) and used role plays (N  =  5). Some interventions handed out written material (N  =  5) or used multimedia as a didactic method (N  =  3). Only three studies reported that they had used clinical practice and supervision as an intervention, and in one study, a patient told his recovery story to participants. The amount of information provided on the content and didactic methods used in interventions varied greatly. One study published the intervention manual online (Armstrong et al.,), whereas other studies provided only minimal information.\nFour studies reported that they had adapted their interventions or measures to the specific cultural context, but the descriptions remained rather vague. As an example, Bradshaw et al. reported that 'attempts were made to ensure that course materials were culturally appropriate to a South African community' (p. 99). Outcomes of these interventions were most often measured using non-validated questionnaires (N  =  11) or validated questionnaires (N  =  6). Additionally, two studies used qualitative interviews for measuring outcomes, one study used interviews with patients and direct observation of health workers' skills, and two studies measured behavioural intentions.\nWith regards to risk of bias, the quality of the included studies varied greatly, but no study showed low risk of bias (the full risk of bias assessment is available in the online Supplementary Material). Only six studies compared their intervention with a control condition (Shirazi et al.,; Sadik et al.,; Alexander et al.,; Li et al.,; Vesel et al.,; Hofmann-Broussard et al.,), two of which used random allocation. Four studies applied quasi-experimental designs, e.g. testing an intervention in one district and using another district as a control group. All studies had administered self-reported outcome measures; thus, no blinding of outcome assessment was done. Many studies reported high drop-out rates, but only one study used intention-to-treat analysis for dealing with missing data. No meta-analysis could be calculated, for the following reasons: of the six studies that had compared their intervention with a control condition, two studies published no or incomplete data (Shirazi et al.,; Alexander et al.,), two studies presented outcome measures that could not be used in meta-analysis (Sadik et al.,; Vesel et al.,) and one study compared two different didactic methods (Li et al.,).\nThe descriptive analysis of the outcomes is displayed in Table 1. Most studies found some kind of positive effects of their intervention on attitudes of PHC staff towards people with mental illness, but some of these effects were rather small, e.g. statistically significant change in the percentage of positive responses to single items with binary response format (Chinnayya et al.,; Ucok et al.,; Armstrong et al.,). Some studies reported positive outcomes but did not present results of their statistical analyses (Shirazi et al.,; Cui et al.,). No or little effects were found from short training interventions, e.g. a 1-h training on depression screening (Alexander et al.,) or a one-session stigma intervention for general practitioners (Ucok et al.,).\nDifferences regarding types of mental disorders emerged, although inconsistently. Armstrong et al. found a change in attitudes towards people with depression but not towards people with psychosis, whereas Hofmann-Broussard et al. found a stronger effect on attitudes towards psychosis than depression. Two studies compared different curriculums or didactic methods (Shirazi et al.,; Li et al.,), but only one found significant group differences (Li et al.,). Several studies showed a statistically significant change in total scores or subscales of questionnaires (da Silva Cais et al.,; Wang et al.,; Li et al.,; Li et al.,; Hofmann-Broussard et al.,), but these results must be interpreted with caution due to risk of bias.\nFew studies assessed behavioural outcomes alongside attitudes. In one study (Sadik et al.,), psychiatrists evaluated the job skills of trained and untrained PHC staff. Evaluators were blinded to participants' group assignment. In addition, patients were interviewed. The study showed differences between the study groups. And two studies (Li et al.,; Li et al.,) applied the Reported and Intended Behaviour Scale (Evans-Lacko et al.,) to assess behavioural discrimination. Li et al. found a significant group x time interaction, indicating a difference between the two didactic methods tested in the study (see Table 1).\nDiscussion\nThis systematic review looked at interventions to reduce stigma among a variety of PHC workers (e.g. general practitioners, nurses, community health workers or volunteers) in LMICs. A total of 18 studies were included. The quality of included studies varied greatly, with a high number of studies showing a high risk of bias. Six studies (33%) have tested their intervention against a control condition, and only two studies (11%) had used random allocation. Moreover, a large number of studies reported high numbers of incomplete data but did not provide any information on how they dealt with missing values. From the present state of the literature, no meaningful conclusions can be drawn on the effectiveness of stigma interventions, key ingredients or target populations within health care. In the following, we aim to highlight suggestions on how to design future studies, in order to enhance the amount and the quality of evidence.\nAs reported in a previous systematic review on stigma interventions with PHC staff (Henderson et al.,), all included studies measured outcomes by assessing knowledge and attitudes, with only a few studies measuring behavioural outcomes. Accordingly, providing theoretical information through lectures was the most frequent intervention, and more practical interventions targeting discriminatory behaviours, such as role plays or clinical practice under supervision, were rarely used. Studies testing such practical interventions are needed to target communication skills and relationship with patients. The protocol for such a study has been published recently (Kohrt et al.,).\nTypes of attitudinal outcome measures varied greatly, ranging from single items with binary response format to validated stigma questionnaires. Items with binary response format do not allow for more complex statistical procedures such as principal component analysis, inferential statistics, multiple imputation of missing values or inclusion of the results in meta-analyses. Moreover, the large diversity of questionnaires used across studies makes it difficult to obtain results, since the underlying constructs of these measures may vary. Consensus is needed on how to measure stigma in order to assess the efficiency of stigma interventions in the future.\nHaving said that, such a consensus should be inclusive for cross-cultural variations in how stigma is assessed and how interventions are designed (Yang et al.,). Several studies reported cultural adaptation of questionnaires, but without using standardised methods for ensuring their validity and reliability, e.g. measurement invariance testing (e.g. Byrne,) or cognitive interviewing. Furthermore, few of the included studies have made an attempt to culturally adapt their interventions. The importance of culturally adapting psychotherapeutic interventions has increasingly been stressed (Chowdhary et al.,). It is most likely that stigma interventions require similar procedures for cultural adaptation, since how stigma is experienced varies across cultures (Yang et al.,; Yang et al.,). Aside from culture, structural and institutional factors may affect how stigma materialises in PHC, e.g. whether a country has a mental health policy, the amount of financial and human resources allocated for mental health, how the mental health system is composed and the level of training of health workers. Taking into account such structural and institutional factors in future studies would enhance their comparability.\nLimitations\nThis review has several limitations. First, we relied on previous reviews for the time before 2013. Second, included studies were published in English, with one exception. Full-text screening in other languages was done where necessary, but no specific search engines such as Scielo were used, and we did not include grey literature. Third, we did not look at outcomes of the interventions in terms of knowledge. Measuring knowledge in the field of mental health is a broad topic, and summarising this evidence would have been beyond the scope of the current review, due to its main focus on attitudes and behaviour.\nConclusions\nThis systematic review provides pathways for future research in stigma interventions for PHC staff. More practical interventions should be implemented and tested in LMICs using more rigorous methods with regards to research design, outcome measures, statistical analysis and dealing with missing data. Moreover, consensus is needed on how to measure stigma, alongside cultural adaptation of both assessment instruments and interventions. The global mental health 'treatment gap' and the integration of mental health into PHC requires evidence-based interventions for addressing stigma, in order to increase access to treatment and provide high-quality care to people suffering from mental disorders worldwide.\nSupple&gt;Supplementary material\nFinancial support\nBAK is supported by the US National Institute of Mental Health (grants K01MH104310 and R21MH111280).

Describe concepts of mental health and beliefs about determinants of mental health and illness among women involved with a PHC project in rural Maharashtra, India; 2. Identify perceived mental health problems in this community, specifically depression, suicide and violence, their perceived causes, and existing and potential community strategies to respond to them and; 3. Investigate the impact of the PHC program on individual and community factors associated with mental health\nMethod\nWe undertook qualitative in-depth interviews with 32 women associated with the PHC project regarding: their concepts of mental health and its determinants; suicide, depression and violence; and the perceived impact of the PHC project on the determinants of mental health.\n\n The interviews were taped, transcribed, translated and thematically analysed.\n\n\nResults\nMental health and illness were understood by these women to be the product of cultural and socio-economic factors.\n\n Mental health was commonly conceptualised as an absence of stress and the commonest stressors were conflict with husbands and mother-in-laws, domestic violence and poverty.\n\n Links between empowerment of women through income generation and education, reduction of discrimination based on caste and sex, and promotion of individual and community mental health were recognised.\n\n However, mental health problems such as suicide and violence were well-described by participants.\n\n\nConclusion\nWhile it is essential that affordable, accessible, appropriate treatments and systems of referral and care are available for people with mental illness in developing country settings, the promotion of mental health by addressing its determinants is another potential strategy for reducing the burden of mental illness for individuals and communities in these settings.\n\n\n","id":"PMC2222163","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"BioMed

Australian social workers on competence in delivering brief cognitive behavioural strategies: A randomised controlled trial","abstract":"Background\nBroad community access to high quality evidence-based primary mental health care is an ongoing challenge around the world.\n\n In Australia one approach has been to broaden access to care by funding psychologists and other allied health care professionals to deliver brief psychological treatments to general practitioners' patients.\n\n To date, there has been a scarcity of studies assessing the efficacy of social worker delivered psychological strategies.\n\n This study aims to build the evidence base by evaluating the impact of a brief educational intervention on social workers' competence in delivering cognitive behavioural strategies (strategies derived from cognitive behavioural therapy).\n\n\nMethods\nA randomised controlled trial design was undertaken with baseline and one-week follow-up measurement of both objective and self-perceived competence.\n\n Simulated consultations with standardised depressed patients were recorded on videotape and objective competence was assessed by blinded reviewers using the Cognitive Therapy Scale.\n\n Questionnaires completed by participants were used to measure self-perceived competence.\n\n The training intervention was a 15 hour face-to-face course involving presentations, video example consultations, written materials and rehearsal of skills in pairs.\n\n\nResults\n40 Melbourne-based (Australia) social workers enrolled and were randomised and 9 of these withdrew from the study before the pre training simulated consultation.\n\n 30 of the remaining 31 social workers (97%) completed all phases of the intervention and evaluation protocol (16 from intervention and 14 from control group).\n\n The intervention group showed significantly greater improvements than the control group in objective competence (mean improvement of 14.2 (7.38-21.02) on the 66 point Cognitive Therapy Scale) and in subjective confidence (mean improvement of 1.28 (0.84-1.72) on a 5 point Likert scale).\n\n On average, the intervention group improved from below to above the base competency threshold on the Cognitive Therapy Scale whilst the control group remained below.\n\n\nConclusions\nSocial workers can attain significant improvements in competency in delivering cognitive behavioural strategies from undertaking brief face to face training.\n\n This is relevant in the context of health reforms that involve social worker delivery of evidence based psychological care.\n\n Further research is required to assess how these improvements in competence translate into performance in practice and clinical outcomes for patients.\n\n\n","id":"PMC2991305","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"BioMed

disorders in developing countries: a cluster randomized controlled trial of a collaborative stepped care intervention in Goa, India","abstract":"Background and Objective\nCommon mental disorders (CMD) are a leading global burden of disease.\n\n Up to 30% of primary care attenders suffer from these disorders but most do not receive evidence-based drug or psychological treatments.\n\n There are no trials of interventions which attempt to integrate these treatments into routine primary care in developing countries.\n\n The aims of this trial (the MANAS Project) are to evaluate the clinical and cost-effectiveness of a collaborative stepped-care intervention for the treatment of CMD in India.\n\n\nStudy Design\nA cluster randomized controlled trial will be implemented in the state of Goa, on the west coast of India.\n\n Twenty-four primary care facilities, 12 from the government sector and 12 from the private sector, will be enrolled in two consecutive phases.\n\n For each sector, facilities will be randomly allocated within strata defined by urban/rural location, population size and presence of a visiting psychiatrist.\n\n Facilities will be randomly allocated to receive the collaborative stepped care intervention or the enhanced usual care control intervention.\n\n Both arms share two components of the intervention, viz.\n\n, routine screening, and in the government clinics provision of antidepressants.\n\n In addition, the collaborative stepped care arm also provides a range of psychosocial treatments delivered by a specially trained Health Counselor, and supervision by a visiting Psychiatrist.\n\n A total of 3600 primary care attenders who are detected to suffer from a CMD based on a validated screening questionnaire will be recruited.\n\n The primary outcome is the proportion of subjects who recover from an ICD10 defined CMD at baseline by 6 months.\n\n Additional endpoints at 2 and 12 months will assess the speed and sustainability of achieving the primary outcomes.\n\n Other outcomes will include recovery from ICD10 defined depression and incidence of ICD-10 among individuals who were sub-threshold cases at baseline.\n\n Economic and disability outcomes will be assessed to estimate incremental cost-effectiveness ratios.\n\n\nImplications\nThis will be the first trial of the effectiveness of a complex intervention aiming to integrate efficacious treatments for CMD into routine primary care in a developing country.\n\n If effective, its findings will have relevance to policy makers who wish to scale up treatments for CMD in primary care across the world, but mostly in those countries where specialist mental health services are few.\n\n\nStudy Registration\nThe MANAS project is registered through the National

Aid (MHFA) training on attitudes to people with mental illness and on knowledge about mental disorders.\n\n Our hypotheses were that at the end of the training participants would have increased knowledge of mental disorders and their treatments, and decreased negative attitudes towards people with mental disorders.\n\n\nMethods\nRespondents were 114 participants in two-day MHFA training workshops for the Vietnamese community in Melbourne conducted by two qualified MHFA trainers.\n\n Participants completed the research questionnaire prior to the commencement of the training (pre-test) and at its completion (post-test).\n\n The questionnaires assessed negative attitudes towards people with mental illness (as described in four vignettes), ability to recognise the mental disorders described in the vignettes, and knowledge about how to assist someone with one of these disorders.\n\n Responses to open-ended questions were content analysed and coded.\n\n To evaluate the effect of the training, answers to the structured questions and to the coded open-ended questions given at pre- and post-test were compared using McNemar tests for dichotomous values and Wilcoxon tests for other scores.\n\n\nResults\nBetween pre- and post-test there was significant improvement in recognition of mental disorders; more targeted and appropriate mental health first aid responses, and reduction in inappropriate first aid responses; and negative attitudes to the people described in the vignettes declined significantly on many items of the stigma scale.\n\n\nConclusion\nA two-day, MHFA training course for general members of the Vietnamese community in Melbourne demonstrated significant reductions in stigmatising attitudes, improved knowledge of mental disorders and improved knowledge about appropriate forms of assistance to give to people in the community with mental disorder.\n\n There is sufficient evidence to scale up to a population level program for the Vietnamese community, and a need for longitudinal evaluation of such a scaled up program.\n\n\n","id":"PMC2745360","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"BioMed

increasing individual risk of developing major depressive disorder.\n\n An alternative strategy to professional treatment of subthreshold depression is population promotion of effective self-help interventions that can be easily applied by an individual without professional guidance.\n\n The evidence for self-help interventions for depressive symptoms is reviewed in the present work, with the aim of identifying promising interventions that could inform future health promotion campaigns or stimulate further research.\n\n\nMethods\nA literature search for randomised controlled trials investigating self-help interventions for depressive disorders or depressive symptoms was performed using PubMed, PsycINFO and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews.\n\n Reference lists and citations of included studies were also checked.\n\n Studies were grouped into those involving participants with depressive disorders or a high level of depressive symptoms, or non-clinically depressed participants not selected for depression.\n\n A number of exclusion criteria were applied, including trials with small sample sizes and where the intervention was adjunctive to antidepressants or psychotherapy.\n\n\nResults\nThe majority of interventions searched had no relevant evidence to review.\n\n Of the 38 interventions reviewed, the ones with the best evidence of efficacy in depressive disorders were S-adenosylmethionine, St John's wort, bibliotherapy, computerised interventions, distraction, relaxation training, exercise, pleasant activities, sleep deprivation, and light therapy.\n\n A number of other interventions showed promise but had received less research attention.\n\n Research in non-clinical samples indicated immediate beneficial effects on depressed mood for distraction, exercise, humour, music, negative air ionisation, and singing; while potential for helpful longer-term effects was found for autogenic training, light therapy, omega 3 fatty acids, pets, and prayer.\n\n Many of the trials were poor quality and may not generalise to self-help without professional guidance.\n\n\nConclusion\nA number of self-help interventions have promising evidence for reducing subthreshold depressive symptoms.\n\n Other forms of evidence such as expert consensus may be more appropriate for interventions that are not feasible to evaluate in randomised controlled trials.\n\n There needs to be evaluation of whether promotion to the public of effective self-help strategies for subthreshold depressive symptoms could delay or prevent onset of depressive illness, reduce functional impairment, and prevent progression to other undesirable outcomes such as harmful use of substances.\n\n\n","id":"PMC2542367","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"BioMed Central","authors":[{"firstname":"Amy

health related quality of life (HRQL) in lower-middle income countries.\n\n This study aimed to investigate HRQL among individuals with and without diabetes in Bangladesh.\n\n\nMethods\nThe analysis is based on data of a case-control study, including 591 patients with type 2 diabetes (cases) who attended an outpatient unit of a hospital in Dhaka and 591 age -and sex-matched individuals without diabetes (controls).\n\n Information about socio-demographic characteristics, health conditions, and HRQL were assessed in a structured interview.\n\n HRQL was measured with the EuroQol (EQ) visual analogue scale (VAS) and the EQ five-dimensional (5D) descriptive system.\n\n The association between diabetes status and quality of life was examined using multiple linear and logistic regression models.\n\n\nResults\nMean EQ-VAS score of patients with diabetes was 11.5 points lower (95 %-CI: ?13.5, ?9.6) compared to controls without diabetes.\n\n Patients with diabetes were more likely to report problems in all EQ-5D dimensions than controls, with the largest effect observed in the dimensions self-care (OR?=?5.9; 95 %-CI: 2.9, 11.8) and mobility (OR?=?4.5; 95 %-CI: 3.0, ?6.6).\n\n In patients with diabetes, male gender, high education, and high-income were associated with higher VAS score and diabetes duration and foot ulcer associated with lower VAS scores.\n\n Other diabetes-related complications were not significantly associated with HRQL.\n\n\nConclusions\nOur findings suggest that the impact of diabetes on HRQL in the Bangladeshi population is much higher than what is known from western populations and that unlike in western populations comorbidities/complications are not the driving factor for this effect.\n\n\n","id":"PMC5022158","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"BioMed

affecting the functioning of the heart or blood vessels and is one of the leading causes of death globally.\n\n Like other countries, CVD prevalence is also rising among the adults in Bangladesh.\n\n Epidemiological studies have shown not only a high CVD prevalence but also a significant increase in its prevalence in Bangladesh in the last few decades.\n\n To have a better understanding of the current CVD prevalence scenario, we conducted this systematic review and meta-analysis.\n\n Our objective was to assess the prevalence of CVD among the Bangladeshi adult population using evidence from the published scientific literature.\n\n\nMethods\nElectronic databases such as MEDLINE, Embase and PubMed were searched.\n\n We also manually checked the references of all relevant publications that describe the prevalence of CVD in Bangladeshi adults.\n\n To pool the CVD prevalence, we used random-effects meta-analysis.\n\n We assessed heterogeneity using both the formal tests and the subgroup analyses.\n\n We also assessed study quality and examined publication bias.\n\n\nResults\nWe retrieved 755 potentially relevant papers through searches of electronic and gray literature, of which only 13 met inclusion criteria after the screening and were included in this review.\n\n Of the studies that met inclusion criteria, three were carried out in rural populations, five in both urban and rural populations and two in strictly urban populations.\n\n Male and female participation in the studies was almost equal.\n\n The weighted pooled prevalence of CVD was 5.0%, regardless of the types of CVD, gender and geographical location of the study participants.\n\n There was also a high heterogeneity in the observed CVD prevalence.\n\n Weighted pooled prevalence of overall CVD in the Bangladeshi population was higher in urban areas (8%) compared to rural areas (2%).\n\n However, no such difference was observed in terms of gender (3% for both males and females).\n\n The highest reported prevalence (21%) was for heart disease, while the lowest reported prevalence (1%) was for stroke.\n\n Sources of heterogeneity were often unexplained.\n\n The criteria used to assess study quality were fulfilled by only a few studies, and adequate sample size criteria was missed by almost all of them.\n\n In addition, there was evidence of small-study effects.\n\n\nConclusion\nA high CVD prevalence along with an upward trend was observed in Bangladeshi adults.\n\n Proper strategies are required for primary prevention of CVD so that a further increase can be alleviated and the

exemplified in the variety of interpretations of the concept across authors.\n\n The aim of this paper is to suggest a conceptualisation of access to health care describing broad dimensions and determinants that integrate demand and supply-side-factors and enabling the operationalisation of access to health care all along the process of obtaining care and benefiting from the services.\n\n\nMethods\nA synthesis of the published literature on the conceptualisation of access has been performed.\n\n The most cited frameworks served as a basis to develop a revised conceptual framework.\n\n\nResults\nHere, we view access as the opportunity to identify healthcare needs, to seek healthcare services, to reach, to obtain or use health care services, and to actually have a need for services fulfilled.\n\n We conceptualise five dimensions of accessibility: 1) Approachability; 2) Acceptability; 3) Availability and accommodation; 4) Affordability; 5) Appropriateness.\n\n In this framework, five corresponding abilities of populations interact with the dimensions of accessibility to generate access.\n\n Five corollary dimensions of abilities include: 1) Ability to

for cardiovascular disease (CVD).\n\n In rural South Asia, hypertension continues to be a significant public health issue with sub-optimal BP control rates.\n\n The goal of the trial is to compare a multicomponent intervention (MCI) to usual care to evaluate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of the MCI for lowering BP among adults with hypertension in rural communities in Bangladesh, Pakistan and Sri Lanka.\n\n\nMethods/design\nThis study is a stratified, cluster randomized controlled trial with a qualitative component for evaluation of processes and stakeholder feedback.\n\n The MCI has five components: (1) home health education by government community health workers (CHWs), (2) BP monitoring and stepped-up referral to a trained general practitioner using a checklist, (3) training public and private providers in management of hypertension and using a checklist, (4) designating hypertension triage counter and hypertension care coordinators in government clinics and (5) a financing model to compensate for additional health services and provide subsidies to low income individuals with poorly controlled hypertension.\n\n Usual care will comprise existing services in the community without any additional training.\n\n\nDiscussion\nThe study will provide evidence of the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of MCI strategies for BP control compared to usual care in the rural public health infrastructure in South Asian countries.\n\n If shown to be successful, MCI may be a long-term sustainable strategy for tackling the rising rates of CVD in low resourced

Early strategic planning and groundwork for evolving and established challenges are crucial to assemble resources and react in an appropriate timely manner.\n\n This article, therefore, focuses on the public perception of comparative lockdown scenario analysis and how they may affect the sustainable development goals (SDGs) and the strategic management regime of COVID-19 pandemic in Bangladesh socio-economically as well as the implications of the withdrawal of partial lockdown plan.\n\n Scenario-based public perceptions were collected via a purposive sampling survey method through a questionnaire.\n\n Datasets were analysed through a set of statistical techniques including classical test theory, principal component analysis, hierarchical cluster analysis, Pearsons correlation matrix and linear regression analysis.\n\n There were good associations among the lockdown scenarios and response strategies to be formulated.\n\n Scenario 1 describes how the death and infection rate will increase if the Bangladesh Government withdraws the existing partial lockdown.\n\n Scenario 2 outlines that limited peoples movement will enable low-level community transmission of COVID-19 with the infection and death rate will increase slowly (r?=?0.540, p?&lt;?0.01).\n\n Moreover, there will be less supply of necessities of daily use with a price hike (r?=?0.680, p?&lt;?0.01).\n\n In scenario 3, full lockdown will reduce community transmission and death from COVID-19 (r?=?0.545, p?&lt;?0.01).\n\n However, along with the other problems gender discrimination and gender-based violence will increase rapidly (r?=?0.661, p?&lt;?0.01).\n\n Due to full lockdown, the formal and informal business, economy, and education sector will be hampered severely (R?=?0.695).\n\n Subsequently, there was a strong association between the loss of livelihood and the unemployment rate which will increase due to business shutdown (p?&lt;?0.01).\n\n This will lead to the severe sufferings of poor and vulnerable communities in both urban and rural areas (p?&lt;?0.01).\n\n All these will further aggravate the humanitarian needs of the most vulnerable groups in the country in the coming months to be followed which will undoubtedly affect the Bangladesh targets to achieve the SDGs of 2030 and other development plans that need to be adjusted.\n\n From our analysis, it was apparent that maintaining partial lockdown with business and economic activities with social distancing and public health guidelines is the best strategy to maintain.\n\n However, as the government withdrew the partial lockdown, inclusive and transparent risk communication towards the public should be followed.\n\n Recovery and strengthening of the health sector, economy, industry, agriculture, and food security should be focused on under the new normal standard of life following health guidelines and social distancing.\n\n Proper response plans and strategic management are necessary for the sustainability of the nation.\n\n\nGraphic abstract\nid='Par2'>\n\nElectronic supplementary material\nThe online version of this article (10.1007/s10668-020-00867-y) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7368637","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Springer Netherlands","authors":[{"firstname":"Mashura","surname":"Shammi","email":"mashura926@juniv.edu","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Md.","surname":"Bodrud-Doza","email":"bodrud.d@brac.net","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Md.","surname":"Bodrud-Doza","email":"bodrud.d@brac.net","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Abu Reza Md.

improve mental well-being among an Asian working population","abstract":"Background\nMental health issues pose a serious concern in the workplace for the huge productivity loss and financial burden associated with it.\n\n Unlike the traditional fixing-what-is-wrong approach, positive psychology offers a less-stigmatized way to promote mental health.\n\n Psychological capital, a concept originated from positive psychology, has been proven effective in improving mental well-being and work performance.\n\n However, little evidence exists for its implementation among Asian working population or its cost-benefit for organizations adopting such promotion strategy.\n\n The current study is designed to assess the protective effects of a web-based psychology capital intervention among Hong Kong working population on individuals mental health and work performance, as well as organizations return-on-investment.\n\n\nMethods/Design\nA two-arm randomized controlled trial design will be adopted.\n\n Eligible working adults will be randomly allocated to either the intervention group or the waiting-list control group, with 177 participants in each arm.\n\n The intervention, which consists of four web-based training sessions, each targeting one of the psychological capital components (hope, efficacy, optimism and resilience), will be implemented over a 4-week period.\n\n On-line surveys will assess the participants in each group at baseline, intervention completion, 1 and 3 months after the completion.\n\n The primary outcome is individuals psychological capital level; secondary outcomes include individuals well-being, depressive symptoms, work engagement and productivity.\n\n Return-on-investment will be calculated from the employers perspective based on productivity gain, savings in medical expenditure, as well as operation and time costs.\n\n Analysis will follow the intention-to-treat principle.\n\n\nDiscussion\nThis is the first experimental study that explores the applicability of psychological capital development among Asian population.\n\n Through investigating changes in individuals work productivity from absenteeism and presenteeism, this will be one of the few studies that quantify productivity gains from any type of mental health promotion.\n\n By demonstrating effectiveness in improving mental well-being and a positive return-on-investment rate, the study may help convince more uptake of similar positive psychology interventions at workplace in Asia and elsewhere.\n\n\nTrail Registration\nNumber (assigned by Centre

through web-based self-help: study protocol for a randomized controlled trial","abstract":"Background\nSuicidal thoughts are common in the general population, causing significant disability.\n\n However, a substantial number of people struggling with suicidality do not access appropriate services.\n\n Online self-help may help overcome barriers to help-seeking.\n\n This study aims to examine the effectiveness of an online self-help program targeted at reducing suicidal thoughts compared with an attention-matched control condition in the Australian adult population.\n\n This trial is based on a Dutch self-help program, which was found to be effective in reducing suicidal thoughts.\n\n\nMethods/Design\nA total of 570 community-dwelling adults (18 to 65 years old) with suicidal thoughts will be recruited via various media and randomly assigned to the 6-week online program aimed at reducing suicidal thoughts or a 6-week attention-matched control program.\n\n Primary outcome measure is the severity of suicidal thoughts.\n\n Secondary outcome measures include suicide plans, capacity to cope with suicidal thoughts, reasons for living, symptoms of depression, hopelessness, anxiety/worry, rumination, panic, perceived burdensomeness and thwarted belongingness, acquired capability, alcohol consumption, insomnia, and various cost-effectiveness measures.\n\n\nDiscussion\nAlthough the original Dutch trial found web-based self-help to be effective in reducing suicidal thoughts, randomized controlled trials (RCT) of online programs for suicidal thoughts are rare.\n\n The present study extends previous research by running the first English language RCT of this sort.\n\n As a result of the original study, the current RCT includes refinements to the design, including greater levels of participant anonymity and longer follow-up periods.\n\n Limitations of this trial include the potential for high drop-out and the inability to ascertain

individuals with depression in Thailand: a randomised controlled trial","abstract":"Background\nThe prevalence of depression is increasing markedly in Thailand.\n\n One way of helping people with depression is to increase their resilience; good resilience is associated with positive outcomes in depression.\n\n The purpose of this study was to examine the effectiveness of a self-help manual on the resilience levels of individuals with depression living in the community in Chiang Mai Province in northern Thailand.\n\n\nMethods\nFifty-six participants with a diagnosis of moderate depression were assigned randomly to either an intervention (n = 27) or control (n = 29) group by means of independent random allocation, using computer generated random numbers.\n\n Fifty-four completed the study (two were excluded shortly after baseline data collection), so an available case analysis was undertaken.\n\n The intervention group were given a self-help manual and continued to receive standard care and treatment, while the control group continued to receive standard care and treatment.\n\n Both groups were also given a short weekly telephone call from a researcher.\n\n Participants were assessed at three time points: baseline (Week 0), immediate post-test (Week 8), and follow-up (Week 12).\n\n Data were collected between October 2007 and April 2008.\nResults\nThe findings showed statistically significant differences between the intervention and the control group, and within the intervention group, in their resilience levels.\n\n Simple main effects analyses of group within time showed a significant difference between both groups at follow-up (p = 0.001), with the intervention group having a higher resilience score than the control group.\n\n Simple main effect of time within the intervention group showed a significant increase in resilience scores from baseline to post-test time points (p &lt; 0.001), from baseline to follow-up (p &lt; 0.001), but not from post-test to follow-up (p = 0.298).\n\n\nConclusions\nThe findings provide preliminary evidence supporting the use of bibliotherapy for increasing resilience in people with moderate depression in a Thai context.\n\n Bibliotherapy is straightforward to use, and an easily accessible addition to the standard approach to promoting recovery.\n\n It is incorporated readily as an adjunct to the work of mental health nurses and other professionals in promoting resilience and enhancing recovery in people with moderate depression in the community.\n\n\nTrial

contemporary psychological treatment.\n\n\nObjective\nThis study investigated the efficacy of the Chinese version of the My Trauma Recovery (CMTR) website.\n\n\nMethods\nIn an urban context, 90 survivors of different trauma types were recruited via Internet advertisements and allocated to a randomized controlled trial (RCT) with a waiting list control condition.\n\n In addition, in a rural context, 93 survivors mainly of the 2008 Sichuan earthquake were recruited in-person for a parallel RCT in which the website intervention was conducted in a counseling center and guided by volunteers.\n\n Assessment was completed online on a professional Chinese survey website.\n\n The primary outcome measure was the Post-traumatic Diagnostic Scale (PDS); secondary outcome measures were Symptom Checklist 90-Depression (SCL-D), Trauma Coping Self-Efficacy Scale (CSE), Post-traumatic Cognitive Changes (PCC), and Social Functioning Impairment (SFI) questionnaires adopted from the My Trauma Recovery website.\n\n\nResults\nFor the urban sample, findings indicated a significant group×time interaction in post-traumatic symptom severity (F\n1,88=7.65, P=.\n\n007).\n\n CMTR reduced post-traumatic symptoms significantly with high effect size after one month of treatment (F\n1,45=15.13, Cohens d=0.81, P&lt;.\n\n001) and the reduction was sustained over a 3-month follow-up (F\n1,45=17.29, Cohens d=0.87, P&lt;.\n\n001).\n\n In the rural sample, the group×time interaction was also significant in post-traumatic symptom severity (F\n1,91=5.35, P=.\n\n02).\n\n Post-traumatic symptoms decreased significantly after treatment (F\n1,48=43.97, Cohens d=1.34, P&lt;.\n\n001) and during the follow-up period (F\n1,48=24.22, Cohens d=0.99, P&lt;.\n\n001).\n\n

treatment groups reduced scores on the BDI-II (p&lt;0.001) and PHQ-9 (p&lt;0.001) compared to the delayed treatment group but did not differ from each other.\n\n Within group effect sizes on the BDI-II were 1.27 and 1.20 for the clinician- and technician-assisted groups respectively, and on the PHQ-9, were 1.54 and 1.60 respectively.\n\n At 4-month follow-up participants in the technician group had made further improvements and had significantly lower scores on the PHQ-9 than those in the clinician group.\n\n A total of approximately 60 minutes of clinician or technician time was required per participant during the 8-week treatment program.\n\n\nConclusions\nBoth clinician- and technician-assisted treatment resulted in large effect sizes and clinically significant improvements comparable to those associated with face-to-face treatment, while a delayed treatment control group did not improve.\n\n These results provide support for large scale trials to determine the clinical effectiveness and acceptability of technician-assisted iCBT programs for depression.\n\n This form of treatment has potential to increase the capacity of existing mental health services.\n\n\nTrial

realist synthesis of randomised control trials involving use of community health workers for delivering child health interventions in low and middle income countries","abstract":"Background\nA key constraint to saturating coverage of interventions for reducing the burden of childhood illnesses in Low and Middle Income Countries (LMIC) is the lack of human resources.\n\n Community health workers (CHW) are potentially important actors in bridging this gap.\n\n Evidence exists on effectiveness of CHW in management of some childhood illnesses (IMCI).\n\n However, we need to know how and when this comes to be.\n\n We examine evidence from randomized control trials (RCT) on CHW interventions in IMCI in LMIC from a realist perspective with the aim to see if they can yield insight into the working of the interventions, when examined from a different perspective.\n\n\nMethods\nThe realist approach involves educing the mechanisms through which an intervention produced an outcome in a particular context.\n\n 'Mechanisms' are reactions, triggered by the interaction of the intervention and a certain context, which lead to change.\n\n These are often only implicit and are actually hypothesized by the reviewer.\n\n This review is limited to unravelling these from the RCTs; it is thus a hypothesis generating exercise.\n\n\nResults\nInterventions to improve CHW performance included 'Skills based training of CHW', 'Supervision and referral support from public health services', 'Positioning of CHW in the community'.\n\n When interventions were applied in context of CHW programs embedded in local health services, with beneficiaries who valued services and had unmet needs, the interventions worked if following mechanisms were triggered: anticipation of being valued by the community; perception of improvement in social status; sense of relatedness with beneficiaries and public services; increase in self esteem; sense of self efficacy and enactive mastery of tasks; sense of credibility, legitimacy and assurance that there was a system for back-up support.\n\n Studies also showed that if context differed, even with similar interventions, negative mechanisms could be triggered, compromising CHW performance.\n\n\nConclusion\nThe aim of this review was to explore if RCTs could yield insight into the working of the interventions, when examined from a different, a realist perspective.\n\n We found that RCTs did yield some insight, but the hypotheses generated were very general and not well refined.\n\n These hypotheses need to be tested and refined in further studies.\n\n\n","id":"PMC2964693","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"BioMed Central","authors":[{"firstname":"Sumit

service delivery: protocol for a cluster randomised quasi-experimental investigation of staff-focused values interventions","abstract":"Background\nThere is growing acceptance that optimal service provision for individuals with severe and recurrent mental illness requires a complementary focus on medical recovery (i.\n\ne.\n\n, symptom management and general functioning) and personal recovery (i.\n\ne.\n\n, having a life worth living).\n\n Despite significant research attention and policy-level support, the translation of this vision of healthcare into changed workplace practice continues to elude.\n\n Over the past decade, evidence-based training interventions that seek to enhance the knowledge, attitudes, and skills of staff working in the mental health field have been implemented as a primary redress strategy.\n\n However, a large body of multi-disciplinary research indicates disappointing rates of training transfer.\n\n There is an absence of empirical research that investigates the importance of worker-motivation in the uptake of desired workplace change initiatives.\n\n Autonomy is acknowledged as important to human effectiveness and as a correlate of workplace variables like productivity, and wellbeing.\n\n To our knowledge, there have been no studies that investigate purposeful and structured use of values-based interventions to facilitate increased autonomy as a means of promoting enhanced implementation of workplace change.\n\n\nMethods\nThis study involves 200 mental health workers across 22 worksites within five community-managed organisations in three Australian states.\n\n It involves cluster-randomisation of participants within organisation, by work site, to the experimental (values) condition, or the control (implementation).\n\n Both conditions receive two days of training focusing on an evidence-based framework of mental health service delivery.\n\n The experimental group receives a third day of values-focused intervention and 12 months of values-focused coaching.\n\n Well-validated self-report measures are used to explore variables related to values concordance, autonomy, and self-reported implementation success.\n\n Audits of work files and staff work samples are reviewed for each condition to determine the impact of implementation.\n\n Self-determination theory and theories of organisational change are used to interpret the data.\n\n\nDiscussion\nThe research adds to the current knowledge base related to worker motivation and uptake of workplace practice.\n\n It describes a structured protocol that aims to enhance worker autonomy for imposed workplace practices.\n\n The research will inform how best to measure and conceptualise transfer.\n\n These findings will apply particularly to contexts where individuals are not volunteers in requisite change processes.\n\n\nTrial registration\nACTRN:

determinants of research utilization by nurses: a systematic review update","abstract":"Background\nInterventions that have a better than random chance of increasing nurses' use of research are important to the delivery of quality patient care.\n\n However, few reports exist of successful research utilization in nursing interventions.\n\n Systematic identification and evaluation of individual characteristics associated with and predicting research utilization may inform the development of research utilization interventions.\n\n\nObjective\nTo update the evidence published in a previous systematic review on individual characteristics influencing research utilization by nurses.\n\n\nMethods\nAs part of a larger systematic review on research utilization instruments, 12 online bibliographic databases were searched.\n\n Hand searching of specialized journals and an ancestry search was also conducted.\n\n Randomized controlled trials, clinical trials, and observational study designs examining the association between individual characteristics and nurses' use of research were eligible for inclusion.\n\n Studies were limited to those published in the English, Danish, Swedish, and Norwegian languages.\n\n A vote counting approach to data synthesis was taken.\n\n\nResults\nA total of 42,770 titles were identified, of which 501 were retrieved.\n\n Of these 501 articles, 45 satisfied our inclusion criteria.\n\n Articles assessed research utilization in general (n = 39) or kinds of research utilization (n = 6) using self-report survey measures.\n\n Individual nurse characteristics were classified according to six categories: beliefs and attitudes, involvement in research activities, information seeking, education, professional characteristics, and socio-demographic/socio-economic characteristics.\n\n A seventh category, critical thinking, emerged in studies examining kinds of research utilization.\n\n Positive relationships, at statistically significant levels, for general research utilization were found in four categories: beliefs and attitudes, information seeking, education, and professional characteristics.\n\n The only characteristic assessed in a sufficient number of studies and with consistent findings for the kinds of research utilization was attitude towards research; this characteristic had a positive association with instrumental and overall research utilization.\n\n\nConclusions\nThis review reinforced conclusions in the previous review with respect to positive relationships between general research utilization

Attitudes and Practices by Health Workers toward Patients with HIV/AIDS in Nigeria","abstract":"Background\nNigeria has an estimated 3.6 million people with HIV/AIDS and is home to one out of every 11 people with HIV/AIDS worldwide.\n\n This study is the first population-based assessment of discrimination against people living with HIV/AIDS in the health sector of a country.\n\n The purpose of this study was to characterize the nature and extent of discriminatory practices and attitudes in the health sector and indicate possible contributing factors and intervention strategies.\n\n The study involved a cross-sectional survey of 1,021 Nigerian health-care professionals (including 324 physicians, 541 nurses, and 133 midwives identified by profession) in 111 health-care facilities in four Nigerian states.\n\n\nMethods and Findings\nFifty-four percent of the health-care professionals (550/1,021) were sampled from public tertiary care facilities.\n\n Nine percent of professionals reported refusing to care for an HIV/AIDS patient, and 9% indicated that they had refused an HIV/AIDS patient admission to a hospital.\n\n Fifty-nine percent agreed that people with HIV/AIDS should be on a separate ward, and 40% believed a person's HIV status could be determined by his or her appearance.\n\n Ninety-one percent agreed that staff and health-care professionals should be informed when a patient is HIV-positive so they can protect themselves.\n\n Forty percent believed that health-care professionals with HIV/AIDS should not be allowed to work in any area of health-care that requires patient contact.\n\n Twenty percent agreed that many with HIV/AIDS behaved immorally and deserve the disease.\n\n Basic materials needed for treatment and prevention of HIV were not adequately available.\n\n Twelve percent agreed that treatment of opportunistic infections in HIV/AIDS patients wastes resources, and 8% indicated that treating someone with HIV/AIDS is a waste of precious resources.\n\n Providers who reported working in facilities that did not always practice universal precautions were more likely to favor restrictive policies toward people with HIV/AIDS.\n\n Providers who reported less adequate training in HIV treatment and ethics were also more likely to report negative attitudes toward patients with HIV/AIDS.\n\n There was no consistent pattern of differences in negative attitudes and practices across the different health specialties surveyed.\n\n\nConclusion\nWhile most health-care professionals surveyed reported being in compliance with their ethical obligations despite the lack of resources, discriminatory behavior and attitudes toward patients with HIV/AIDS exist among a significant proportion of health-care professionals in the surveyed states.\n\n Inadequate education about HIV/AIDS and a lack of protective and treatment materials appear to contribute to these practices and attitudes.\n\n\n","id":"PMC1176239","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Public Library of

purpose was to inform development and implementation of a comprehensive district plan to integrate mental health into primary care.\n\n\nMethods\nA situation analysis tool was developed for the study, drawing on existing tools and expert consensus.\n\n Cross-sectional information obtained was largely in the public domain in all five districts.\n\n\nResults\nThe PRIME study districts face substantial contextual and health system challenges many of which are common across sites.\n\n Reliable information on existing treatment coverage for mental disorders was unavailable.\n\n Particularly in the low-income countries, many health service organisational requirements for mental health care were absent, including specialist mental health professionals to support the service and reliable supplies of medication.\n\n Across all sites, community mental health literacy was low and there were no models of multi-sectoral working or collaborations with traditional or religious healers.\n\n Nonetheless health system opportunities were apparent.\n\n In each district there was potential to apply existing models of care for tuberculosis and HIV or non-communicable disorders, which have established mechanisms for detection of drop-out from care, outreach and adherence support.\n\n The extensive networks of community-based health workers and volunteers in most districts provide further opportunities to expand mental health care.\n\n\nConclusions\nThe low level of baseline health system preparedness across sites underlines that interventions at the levels of health care organisation, health facility and community will all be essential for sustainable delivery of quality mental health care integrated into primary care.\n\n\n","id":"PMC3928234","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Public Library of

Uganda","abstract":"Three-quarters of the global mental health burden exists in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), yet the lack of mental health services in resource-poor settings is striking.\n Task-sharing (also, task-shifting), where mental health care is provided by non-specialists, has been proposed to improve access to mental health care in LMICs.\n This multi-site qualitative study investigates the acceptability and feasibility of task-sharing mental health care in LMICs by examining perceptions of primary care service providers (physicians, nurses, and community health workers), community members, and service users in one district in each of the five countries participating in the PRogramme for Improving Mental health carE (PRIME): Ethiopia, India, Nepal, South Africa, and Uganda.\n Thirty-six focus group discussions and 164 in-depth interviews were conducted at the pre-implementation stage between February and October 2012 with the objective of developing district level plans to integrate mental health care into primary care.\n Perceptions of the acceptability and feasibility of task-sharing were evaluated first at the district level in each country through open-coding and then at the cross-country level through a secondary analysis of emergent themes.\n We found that task-sharing mental health services is perceived to be acceptable and feasible in these LMICs as long as key conditions are met: 1) increased numbers of human resources and better access to medications; 2) ongoing structured supportive supervision at the community and primary care-levels; and 3) adequate training and compensation for health workers involved in task-sharing.\n Taking into account the socio-cultural context is fundamental for identifying local personnel who can assist in detection of mental illness and facilitate treatment and care as well as training, supervision, and service delivery.\n By recognizing the systemic challenges and sociocultural nuances that may influence task-sharing mental health care, locally-situated interventions could be more easily planned to provide appropriate and acceptable mental health care in LMICs.\n","id":"PMC4167946","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Pergamon","authors":[{"firstname":"Emily","surname":"Mendenhall","email":"em1061@georgetown.edu","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Mary

With an algorithm comprising two screening questions (1. presence of heart-mind problems and 2. function impairment due to heart-mind problems) to determine who should receive the full PHQ-9, the number of patients requiring administration of the PHQ-9 could be reduced by 50 %, PHQ-9 false positives would be reduced by 18 %, and 88 % of patients with depression would be correctly identified.\n\n\nConclusion\nCombining idioms of distress with a transculturally-translated depression screener increases efficiency and maintains accuracy for high levels of detection.\n\n The algorithm reduces the time needed for primary healthcare staff to verbally administer the tool for patients with limited literacy.\n\n The burden of false positives is comparable to rates in high-income countries and is a limitation for universal primary care screening.\n\n\nElectronic supplementary material\nThe online version of this article (doi:10.1186/s12888-016-0768-y) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.\n\n\n","id":"PMC4782581","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"BioMed Central","authors":[{"firstname":"Brandon A.","surname":"Kohrt","email":"brandon.kohrt@duke.edu","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Nagendra P.","surname":"Luitel","email":"luitelnp@gmail.com","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Prakash","surname":"Acharya","email":"pacharya07@gmail.com","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Prakash","surname":"Acharya","email":"pacharya07@gmail.com","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Mark J.

challenges in developing progression criteria for internal pilot studies","abstract":"Objectives\nDesigning studies with an internal pilot phase may optimise the use of pilot work to inform more efficient randomised controlled trials (RCTs).\n\n Careful selection of preagreed decision or progression criteria at the juncture between the internal pilot and main trial phases provides a valuable opportunity to evaluate the likely success of the main trial and optimise its design or, if necessary, to make the decision not to proceed with the main trial.\n\n Guidance on the appropriate selection and application of progression criteria is, however, lacking.\n\n This paper outlines the key issues to consider in the optimal development and review of operational progression criteria for RCTs with an internal pilot phase.\n\n\nDesign\nA structured literature review and exploration of stakeholders' opinions at a Medical Research Council (MRC) Hubs for Trials Methodology Research workshop.\n\n Key stakeholders included triallists, methodologists, statisticians and funders.\n\n\nResults\nThere is considerable variation in the use of progression criteria for RCTs with an internal pilot phase, although 3 common issues predominate: trial recruitment, protocol adherence and outcome data.\n\n Detailed and systematic reporting around the decision-making process for stopping, amending or proceeding to a main trial is uncommon, which may hamper understanding in the research community about the appropriate and optimal use of RCTs with an internal pilot phase.\n\n 10 top tips for the development, use and reporting of progression criteria for internal pilot studies are presented.\n\n\nConclusions\nSystematic and transparent reporting of the design, results and evaluation of internal pilot trials in the literature should be encouraged in order to facilitate understanding in the research community and to inform future

program for community health workers in India: impact on knowledge and attitudes","abstract":"Background\nUnmet needs for mental health treatment in low income countries are pervasive.\n\n If mental health is to be effectively integrated into primary health care in low income countries like India then grass-roots workers need to acquire relevant knowledge and skills to be able to recognise, refer and support people experiencing mental disorders in their own communities.\n\n This study aims to provide a mental health training intervention to community health workers in Bangalore Rural District, Karnataka, India, and to evaluate the impact of this training on mental health literacy.\n\n\nMethods\nA pre-test post-test study design was undertaken with assessment of mental health literacy at three time points; baseline, completion of the training, and three month follow-up.\n\n Mental health literacy was assessed using the interviewer-administered Mental Health Literacy Survey.\n\n The training intervention was a four day course based on a facilitator's manual developed specifically for community health workers in India.\n\n\nResults\n70 community health workers from Doddaballapur, Bangalore Rural District were recuited for the study.\n\n The training course improved participants' ability to recognize a mental disorder in a vignette, and reduced participants' faith in unhelpful and potentially harmful pharmacological interventions.\n\n There was evidence of a minor reduction in stigmatizing attitudes, and it was unclear if the training resulted in a change in participants' faith in recovery following treatment.\n\n\nConclusion\nThe findings from this study indicate that the training course demonstrated potential to be an effective way to improve some aspects of mental health literacy, and highlights strategies for strengthening the training course.\n\n\n","id":"PMC3169476","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"BioMed

health care in Doddaballapur Taluk, Bangalore Rural district, Karnataka","abstract":"Background\nSpecialist mental health care is out of reach for most Indians.\n\n The World Health Organisation has called for the integration of mental health into primary health care as a key strategy in closing the treatment gap.\n\n However, few studies in India have examined medical practitioners mental health-related knowledge and attitudes.\n\n This study examined these facets of service provision amongst doctors providing primary health care in a rural area of Karnataka is Southern India.\n\n\nMethods\nA mental health knowledge and attitudes questionnaire was self- administered by participants.\n\n The questionnaire consisted of four sections; 1) basic demographics and practice information, 2) training in mental health, 3) knowledge of mental health, and self-perceived competence in providing mental health care, and 4) attitudes towards mental health.\n\n Data was analysed quantitatively, primarily using descriptive statistics.\n\n\nResults\nThis study recruited 46 participants.\n\n The majority of participants (69.6%) felt competent in providing mental health services to their patients.\n\n However, there was a substantial level of endorsement for several statements that reflected negative attitudes.\n\n Almost one third of participants (28.0%) had not received any training in providing mental health care.\n\n Whilst three-quarters of participants correctly identified depression (76.1%) and psychosis (76.1%) in a vignette, fewer were able to name three common signs and symptoms of depression (50.0%) and psychosis (28.3%).\n\n\nConclusions\nIntegrating mental health into primary health care requires evidence-based up-skilling programs.\n\n Doctors in this study desired such training and would benefit from it, with a focus on both depth of knowledge and uncovering stigmatising attitudes towards people with mental health problems.\n\n\n","id":"PMC3499292","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"BioMed

China","abstract":"Background\nStigma and discrimination are widely experienced by people with mental illness, even in healthcare settings.\n\n The purposes of this study were to assess mental health stigma among community mental health staff in Guangzhou, China and in doing so also to assess the psychometric properties of the Reported and Intended Behaviour Scale (RIBS) - Chinese version.\n\n\nMethods\nA cross-sectional survey was undertaken among 214 community mental health staff in Guangzhou from September to November, 2013. The Mental Health Knowledge Schedule (MAKS) and RIBS were administered together with the Mental Illness: Clinicians Attitudes Scale (MICA) to evaluate staff stigma from the perspective of knowledge, attitudes and behaviour.\n\n\nResults\nThe total scores of RIBS, MAKS and MICA were (11.97?±?3.41), (16.80?±?5.39) and (51.69?±?6.94) respectively.\n\n Female staff members were more willing to contact people with mental illness than males (t(212)?=??2.85,P?=?0.005) and had more knowledge about mental illness (t(212)?=??2.28,P?=?0.024).\n\n The Chinese version of RIBS had good internal consistency (alpha?=?0.82), test-retest reliability (r?=?0.68,P?&lt;?0.001) and adequate convergent validity, as indicated by a significant negative correlation with the Chinese version of MICA(r?=??0.43, P?&lt;?0.001).\n\n\nConclusions\nOur results show relatively high levels of stigma toward people with mental illness among community mental health staff in Guangzhou, China.\n\n There are slightly gender differences in discriminatory behaviours and stigma related knowledge of mental illness among community mental health staff, with female staff in general less stigmatising.\n\n Accordingly, anti-stigma programmes should be established among healthcare staff.\n\n In addition, the Chinese version of RIBS is a reliable, valid and acceptable measure which can be used to assess the willingness of participants to contact people with mental illness in future anti-stigma campaigns.\n\n\n","id":"PMC4149249","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"BioMed

measures among Western samples, it is unclear whether negative attitudes can be automatically activated in individuals from non-Western countries.\n This study attempted to validate results from Western samples with Chinese college students.\n We first examined the three-component model of implicit stigma (negative cognition, negative affect, and discriminatory tendencies) toward mental illness with the Single Category Implicit Association Test (SC-IAT).\n We also explored the relationship between explicit and implicit stigma among 56 Chinese university college students.\n In the three separate SC-IATs and the combined SC-IAT, automatic associations between mental illness and negative descriptors were stronger relative to those with positive descriptors and the implicit effect of cognitive and affective SC-IATs were significant.\n Explicit and implicit measures of stigma toward mental illness were unrelated.\n In our sample, women's overall attitudes toward mental illness were more negative than men's were, but no gender differences were found for explicit measures.\n These findings suggested that implicit stigma toward mental illness exists in Chinese students, and provide some support for the three-component model of implicit stigma toward mental illness.\n Future studies that focus on automatic components of stigmatization and stigma-reduction in China are warranted.\n","id":"PMC3461029","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Public Library of

important public health issue, and interventions aimed at reducing exposure to stigma and discrimination can improve the lives of people with mental health problems.\n\n Social contact has long been considered to be one of the most effective strategies for improving inter-group relations.\n\n For this study, we assess the impact of a population level social contact intervention among people with and without mental health problems.\n\n\nMethods\nThis study investigated the impact of social contact and whether presence of specific facilitating factors (equal status, common goals, cooperation and friendship potential): (1) improves intended stigmatising behaviour; (2) increases future willingness to disclose a mental health problem; and (3) promotes behaviours associated with anti-stigma campaign engagement.\n\n Two mass participation social contact programmes within Englands Time to Change campaign were evaluated via a 2-part questionnaire.\n\n 403 participants completed initial

events facilitated meaningful intergroup social contact between individuals with and without mental health problems.\n\n Presence of facilitating conditions predicted improved stigma-related behavioural intentions and subsequent campaign engagement 46 weeks following social contact.\n\n Contact, however, was not predictive of future willingness to disclose mental health problems.\n\n\nConclusions\nFindings emphasise the importance of facilitating conditions to promote positive social contact between individuals and also suggest that social contact interventions can work on a mass level.\n\n Future research should investigate this type of large scale intervention among broader and more representative populations.\n\n\n","id":"PMC3461459","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"BioMed

Students","abstract":"Although some research has examined negative automatic aspects of attitudes toward mental illness via relatively indirect measures among Western samples, it is unclear whether negative attitudes can be automatically activated in individuals from non-Western countries.\n This study attempted to validate results from Western samples with Chinese college students.\n We first examined the three-component model of implicit stigma (negative cognition, negative affect, and discriminatory tendencies) toward mental illness with the Single Category Implicit Association Test (SC-IAT).\n We also explored the relationship between explicit and implicit stigma among 56 Chinese university college students.\n In the three separate SC-IATs and the combined SC-IAT, automatic associations between mental illness and negative descriptors were stronger relative to those with positive descriptors and the implicit effect of cognitive and affective SC-IATs were significant.\n Explicit and implicit measures of stigma toward mental illness were unrelated.\n In our sample, women's overall attitudes toward mental illness were more negative than men's were, but no gender differences were found for explicit measures.\n These findings suggested that implicit stigma toward mental illness exists in Chinese students, and provide some support for the three-component model of implicit stigma toward mental illness.\n Future studies that focus on automatic components of stigmatization and stigma-reduction in China are warranted.\n","id":"PMC3461029","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Public Library of

schizophrenia, bipolar disorders and autism in France","abstract":"Background\nIn order to support evidence-based policies for reduction of stigma, a better understanding of its components: ignorance (knowledge), prejudice (attitude) and discrimination (behaviour) is necessary.\n\n This study explores public perceptions and quantifies stigma for three chronic mental disorders: autism, schizophrenia and bipolar disorders in France.\n\n\nMethods\nSurvey of 1000 adults selected from an established market research panel.\n\n The 21-item questionnaire explored knowledge, attitudes and behaviours toward each disorder.\n\n\nResults\nAlthough 95% respondents recognized the names of each disorder fewer than 70% could report specific characteristics and only 33% considered that publically available information was adequate; most respondents identified the media as their main resource.\n\n Labeling of conditions in a negative way was frequent (61%) when referring to mental disorders in general, but fell significantly (18%) when linked to an individual with a disorder.\n\n Individuals with schizophrenia are assumed to be dangerous; 65% respondents would engage in social distancing from such an individual, versus 29% for bipolar disorders and 7% for autism (p?&lt;?0.001).\n\n In contrast to other disorders, discrimination against schizophrenia was only partly attenuated in those with familiarity with mental disorders (through personal or family illness).\n\n\nConclusion\nThis first population-based survey in France shows that attitudes towards bipolar disorders and autism are less prejudicial than towards schizophrenia.\n\n However, most public attitudes and behaviours towards different disorders appear to be based on assumptions rather than knowledge or evidence suggesting a generic information or anti-stigma programme is unlikely to be effective.\n\n\n","id":"PMC3532222","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"BioMed

workers to deliver mental health care: Stakeholder perceptions from the PRIME district sites in Ethiopia, India, Nepal, South Africa, and Uganda","abstract":"Three-quarters of the global mental health burden exists in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), yet the lack of mental health services in resource-poor settings is striking.\n Task-sharing (also, task-shifting), where mental health care is provided by non-specialists, has been proposed to improve access to mental health care in LMICs.\n This multi-site qualitative study investigates the acceptability and feasibility of task-sharing mental health care in LMICs by examining perceptions of primary care service providers (physicians, nurses, and community health workers), community members, and service users in one district in each of the five countries participating in the PRogramme for Improving Mental health carE (PRIME): Ethiopia, India, Nepal, South Africa, and Uganda.\n Thirty-six focus group discussions and 164 in-depth interviews were conducted at the pre-implementation stage between February and October 2012 with the objective of developing district level plans to integrate mental health care into primary care.\n Perceptions of the acceptability and feasibility of task-sharing were evaluated first at the district level in each country through open-coding and then at the cross-country level through a secondary analysis of emergent themes.\n We found that task-sharing mental health services is perceived to be acceptable and feasible in these LMICs as long as key conditions are met: 1) increased numbers of human resources and better access to medications; 2) ongoing structured supportive supervision at the community and primary care-levels; and 3) adequate training and compensation for health workers involved in task-sharing.\n Taking into account the socio-cultural context is fundamental for identifying local personnel who can assist in detection of mental illness and facilitate treatment and care as well as training, supervision, and service delivery.\n By recognizing the systemic challenges and sociocultural nuances that may influence task-sharing mental health care, locally-situated interventions could be more easily planned to provide appropriate and acceptable mental health care in LMICs.\n","id":"PMC4167946","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Pergamon","authors":[{"firstname":"Emily","surname":"Mendenhall","email":"em1061@georgetown.edu","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Mary

China","abstract":"Background\nStigma and discrimination are widely experienced by people with mental illness, even in healthcare settings.\n\n The purposes of this study were to assess mental health stigma among community mental health staff in Guangzhou, China and in doing so also to assess the psychometric properties of the Reported and Intended Behaviour Scale (RIBS) - Chinese version.\n\n\nMethods\nA cross-sectional survey was undertaken among 214 community mental health staff in Guangzhou from September to November, 2013. The Mental Health Knowledge Schedule (MAKS) and RIBS were administered together with the Mental Illness: Clinicians Attitudes Scale (MICA) to evaluate staff stigma from the perspective of knowledge, attitudes and behaviour.\n\n\nResults\nThe total scores of RIBS, MAKS and MICA were (11.97?±?3.41), (16.80?±?5.39) and (51.69?±?6.94) respectively.\n\n Female staff members were more willing to contact people with mental illness than males (t(212)?=??2.85,P?=?0.005) and had more knowledge about mental illness (t(212)?=??2.28,P?=?0.024).\n\n The Chinese version of RIBS had good internal consistency (alpha?=?0.82), test-retest reliability (r?=?0.68,P?&lt;?0.001) and adequate convergent validity, as indicated by a significant negative correlation with the Chinese version of MICA(r?=??0.43, P?&lt;?0.001).\n\n\nConclusions\nOur results show relatively high levels of stigma toward people with mental illness among community mental health staff in Guangzhou, China.\n\n There are slightly gender differences in discriminatory behaviours and stigma related knowledge of mental illness among community mental health staff, with female staff in general less stigmatising.\n\n Accordingly, anti-stigma programmes should be established among healthcare staff.\n\n In addition, the Chinese version of RIBS is a reliable, valid and acceptable measure which can be used to assess the willingness of participants to contact people with mental illness in future anti-stigma campaigns.\n\n\n","id":"PMC4149249","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"BioMed

primary health care workers in three disparate regions in Kenya","abstract":"Background\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) and the Government of Kenya alike identify a well-performing health workforce as key to attaining better health.\n\n Nevertheless, the motivation and retention of health care workers (HCWs) persist as challenges.\n\n This study investigated factors influencing motivation and retention of HCWs at primary health care facilities in three different settings in Kenya - the remote area of Turkana, the relatively accessible region of Machakos, and the disadvantaged informal urban settlement of Kibera in Nairobi.\n\n\nMethods\nA cross-sectional cluster sample design was used to select 59 health facilities that yielded interviews with 404 health care workers, grouped into 10 different types of service providers.\n\n Data were collected in November 2011 using structured questionnaires and a Focus Group Discussion guide.\n\n Findings were analyzed using bivariate and multivariate methods of the associations and determinants of health worker motivation and retention.\n\n\nResults\nThe levels of education and gender factors were lowest in Turkana with female HCWs representing only 30% of the workers against a national average of 53%.\n\n A smaller proportion of HCWs in Turkana feel that they have adequate training for their jobs.\n\n Overall, 13% of the HCWs indicated that they had changed their job in the last 12 months and 20% indicated that they could leave their current job within the next two years.\n\n In terms of work environment, inadequate access to electricity, equipment, transport, housing, and the physical state of the health facility were cited as most critical, particularly in Turkana.\n\n The working environment is rated as better in private facilities.\n\n Adequate training, job security, salary, supervisor support, and manageable workload were identified as critical satisfaction factors.\n\n Family health care, salary, and terminal benefits were rated as important compensatory factors.\n\n\nConclusions\nThere are distinct motivational and retention factors that affect HCWs in the three regions.\n\n Findings and policy implications from this study point to a set of recommendations to be implemented at national and county levels.\n\n These include gender mainstreaming, development of appropriate retention schemes, competitive compensation packages, strategies for career growth, establishment of a model HRH community, and the conduct of a discrete choice experiment.\n\n\n","id":"PMC4097093","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"BioMed

remote rural areas in middle- and low-income countries: A literature review of attraction and retention","abstract":"Background\nMany countries in middle- and low-income countries today suffer from severe staff shortages and/or maldistribution of health personnel which has been aggravated more recently by the disintegration of health systems in low-income countries and by the global policy environment.\n\n One of the most damaging effects of severely weakened and under-resourced health systems is the difficulty they face in producing, recruiting, and retaining health professionals, particularly in remote areas.\n\n Low wages, poor working conditions, lack of supervision, lack of equipment and infrastructure as well as HIV and AIDS, all contribute to the flight of health care personnel from remote areas.\n\n In this global context of accelerating inequities health service policy makers and managers are searching for ways to improve the attraction and retention of staff in remote areas.\n\n But the development of appropriate strategies first requires an understanding of the factors which influence decisions to accept and/or stay in a remote post, particularly in the context of mid and low income countries (MLICS), and which strategies to improve attraction and retention are therefore likely to be successful.\n\n It is the aim of this review article to explore the links between attraction and retention factors and strategies, with a particular focus on the organisational diversity and location of decision-making.\n\n\nMethods\nThis is a narrative literature review which took an iterative approach to finding relevant literature.\n\n It focused on English-language material published between 1997 and 2007. The authors conducted Pubmed searches using a range of different search terms relating to attraction and retention of staff in remote areas.\n\n Furthermore, a number of relevant journals as well as unpublished literature were systematically searched.\n\n While the initial search included articles from high- middle- and low-income countries, the review focuses on middle- and low-income countries.\n\n About 600 papers were initially assessed and 55 eventually included in the review.\n\n\nResults\nThe authors argue that, although factors are multi-facetted and complex, strategies are usually not comprehensive and often limited to addressing a single or limited number of factors.\n\n They suggest that because of the complex interaction of factors impacting on attraction and retention, there is a strong argument to be made for bundles of interventions which include attention to living environments, working conditions and environments and development opportunities.\n\n They further explore the organisational location of decision-making related to retention issues and suggest that because promising strategies often lie beyond the scope of human resource directorates or ministries of health, planning and decision-making to improve retention requires multi-sectoral collaboration within and beyond government.\n\n The paper provides a simple framework for bringing the key decision-makers together to identify factors and develop multi-facetted comprehensive strategies.\n\n\nConclusion\nThere are no set answers to the problem of attraction and retention.\n\n It is only through learning about what works in terms of fit between problem analysis and strategy and effective navigation through the politics of implementation that any headway will be made against the almost universal challenge of staffing health service in remote rural areas.\n\n\n","id":"PMC2259330","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"BioMed Central","authors":[{"firstname":"Uta","surname":"Lehmann","email":"ulehmann@uwc.ac.za","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Marjolein","surname":"Dieleman","email":"m.dieleman@kit.nl","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Tim","surname":"Martineau","email":"T.Martineau@liv.ac.uk","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Human resources for health challenges in fragile states: evidence from Sierra Leone, South Sudan and Zimbabwe","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1186/1752-1505-8-11","date":"2014-06-04","title":"A window of opportunity for reform in post-conflict settings? The case of Human Resources for Health policies in Sierra Leone, 20022012","abstract":"Background\nIt is recognized that decisions taken in the early recovery period may affect the development of health systems.\n\n Additionally, some suggest that the immediate post-conflict period may allow for the opening of a political window of opportunity for reform.\n\n For these reasons, it is useful to reflect on the policy space that exists in this period, by what it is shaped, how decisions are made, and what are their long-term implications.\n\n Examining the policy trajectory and its determinants can be helpful to explore the specific features of the post-conflict policy-making environment.\n\n With this aim, the study looks at the development of policies on human resources for health (HRH) in Sierra Leone over the decade after the conflict (20022012).\n\n\nMethods\nMultiple sources were used to collect qualitative data on the period between 2002 and 2012: a stakeholder mapping workshop, a document review and a series of key informant interviews.\n\n The analysis draws from political economy and policy analysis tools, focusing on the drivers of reform, the processes, the contextual features, and the actors and agendas.\n\n\nFindings\nOur findings identify three stages of policy-making.\n\n At first characterized by political uncertainty, incremental policies and stop-gap measures, the context substantially changed in 2009. The launch of the Free Health Care Initiative provided to be an instrumental event and catalyst for health system, and HRH, reform.\n\n However, after the launch of the initiative, the pace of HRH decision-making again slowed down.\n\n\nConclusions\nOur study identifies the key drivers of HRH policy trajectory in Sierra Leone: (i) the political situation, at first uncertain and later on more defined; (ii) the availability of funding and the stances of agencies providing such funds; (iii) the sense of need for radical change  which is perhaps the only element related to the post-conflict setting.\n\n It also emerges that a windows of opportunity for reform did not open in the immediate post-conflict, but rather 8 years later when the Free Health Care Initiative was announced, thus making it difficult to link it directly to the features of the post-conflict policy-making environment.\n\n\n","id":"PMC4114084","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"BioMed

motivating factors.\n\n The Spearman correlation test was conducted to test the hypothesis that the level of health worker motivation is associated with level of effort by primary healthcare facilities to improve quality care and patient safety.\n\n\nResults\nThe quality care situation in health facilities was generally low, as determined by the SafeCare Essentials tool and NHIA data.\n\n The majority of facilities assessed did not have documented evidence of processes for continuous quality improvement and patient safety.\n\n Overall, staff motivation appeared low although workers in private facilities perceived better working conditions than workers in public facilities (P &lt;0.05).\n\n Significant positive associations were found between staff satisfaction levels with working conditions and the clinics effort towards quality improvement and patient safety (P &lt;0.05).\n\n\nConclusion\nAs part of efforts towards attainment of the health related MDGs in Ghana, more comprehensive staff motivation interventions should be integrated into quality improvement strategies especially in government-owned healthcare facilities where working conditions are perceived to be the worst.\n\n\n","id":"PMC3765920","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"BioMed Central","authors":[{"firstname":"Robert

As such, stigma is a global public health threat that can have consequences on the epidemiology of HIV and other health conditions. The most commonly used definition of stigma is the one articulated by Goffman in his seminal work 'Stigma: Notes on the Management of Spoiled Identity'. He defined stigma as a process through which individuals are 'disqualified from full social acceptance' due to an undesirable 'mark' or 'label'. This label can be a physical, health or behavioural attribute that is deemed 'deeply discrediting'. Half a century after Goffman's seminal work was first published, interest in stigma has grown exponentially. The study of stigma has extended beyond sociology (where it originated) to public health and, most notably, HIV epidemiology. \nThe vast majority of stigma intervention research focuses on averting discrimination (also known as enacted stigma). But people may also internalise stigma, leading to what Goffman called 'spoiled identities' or self-stigma. Self-stigma occurs when people who belong to a socially discredited group (eg, people living with HIV, people who use illicit drugs) internalise feelings of shame and worthlessness due to their socially devalued identity, or 'spoiled identity'. Although self-stigma is experienced by individuals, it is also influenced by structural and relational forces that dominate their lives, such as discrimination, social exclusion and poverty. In line with this, Livingston and Boyd define self-stigma as 'asubjective process, embedded within a socio-cultural context, which may be characterized by negative feelings (about self), maladaptive behaviour, identity transformation, or stereotype endorsement resulting from an individual's experiences, perceptions, or anticipation of negative social reactions on the basis of their [socially devalued identity or] illness'. Self-stigma is particularly dangerous because it impacts anticipated and perceived stigma, and influences affective, cognitive and mental health outcomes, as well as healthcare behaviours, which ultimately affect physical health outcomes. In short, self-stigma contributes to AIDS-related morbidity and mortality by hampering adherence to life-saving antiretroviral treatment (ART), constraining people's quality of life and spurring suicidal ideation. \nUnlike HIV-related discrimination, self-stigma remains strikingly understudied with no evidence of well-established, large-scale programmes to address it. In particular, there are two major gaps in our understanding of how to address self-stigma among people living with or affected by HIV. First, there is no synthesis of evidence on what works to address self-stigma in resource-limited settings. A recent systematic review and meta-analysis examined antistigma interventions in healthcare settings but only found eight studies reporting on self-stigma as a stand-alone outcome. Of these eight studies, three studies reported significant reductions in self-stigma, another three reported reductions in self-stigma that were not statistically significant, and two provided insufficient data for inferences about stigma reduction. While this previous review focused on interventions in healthcare settings, specialised mental health resources are scarce in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs), and interventions are often delivered by community-based organisations or peers outside of the healthcare system. In such settings, it is essential to advance our understanding on what works to address self-stigma through scalable, community-based responses.\nSecond, no systematic review has explored what works to address other sources of self-stigma experienced by people living with or affected by HIV. For example, gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men, sex workers, transgender people, people who inject drugs and incarcerated people are identified as 'key populations' who are particularly vulnerable to HIV. But a number of sociostructural risks including stigma and discrimination, poverty, punitive laws and policies, and violence also make these populations vulnerable to self-stigma related to their marginalised identities. Key populations may experience additional self-stigma due to viral hepatitis, which is highly prevalent in these groups. Similarly, people living with HIV in LMICs are also highly vulnerable to tuberculosis (TB) coinfection, and it is important to understand what works to address the resultant self-stigma. It is essential to review this body of evidence to inform culturally sensitive, scalable and sustainable service delivery models that reach the most marginalised populations disproportionately affected by HIV-related and other types of self-stigma.\nIn this review, we aim to address these gaps by identifying, synthesising and critically appraising existing evidence of interventions aiming to reduce self-stigma experienced by people living with HIV and key populations affected by HIV in LMICs. It is hoped that this review will inform much-needed programmes to address self-stigma among communities that are disproportionately marginalised.\nMethods\nReview scope\nThe scope of this review is restricted to intervention studies measuring any type of self-stigma as an outcome among people living with HIV or key populations affected by HIV (table 1).\nScope of the review\nOutcome	Internalised or self-stigma, shame, negative self-image, negative self-perception related to HIV status, other diseases that disproportionately affect people living with HIV (tuberculosis, hepatitis) or stigmatised behaviours of key populations affected by HIV (sex work, male-to-male sexual intercourse, drug use, transgender expression).	 	Population	People living with HIV, sex workers, men who have sex with men, people who use drugs, transgender people of all ages.	 	Geographical location	Low-income and middle-income countries.	 	Study design	Randomised controlled trials.Controlled clinical trials.Prospective controlled cohort studies.Retrospective controlled cohort studies if baseline exposure data were collected at time of baseline of study.Controlled before and after studies including econometric studies.Interrupted time series studies.	 	\nSearch strategy\nStudies were identified through electronic searches of bibliographic databases and grey literature sites, examining citations of retrieved studies, and contacting researchers working in the area. The larger databases were searched through OvidSP (PsycARTICLES, Embase, Global Health, Ovid MEDLINE and PsycINFO), using a sensitive search string summarised in the study protocol. Smaller databases (Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature and WHO Afro Library) incorporated a simpler, more inclusive search string also summarised in the protocol. The exact search strings used for each database are included in online supplementary file 1 for reproducibility. Key authors were contacted for unpublished and ongoing studies, as well as additional information from published papers. References listed from other reviews on HIV/AIDS stigma and other relevant studies were also screened.\nInclusion and exclusion criteria\nTo be eligible for inclusion in the review, the study had to meet all of the prespecified inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria set out in table 2. In an attempt to assess intervention effectiveness and inform potential scale-up of promising interventions, only study designs that allowed for causal inferences were included. Therefore, this systematic review included randomised controlled trials, controlled clinical trials, prospective controlled cohort studies, retrospective controlled cohort studies if baseline exposure data were collected at time of baseline of study, controlled before and after studies including econometric studies, and interrupted time series studies.\nInclusion and exclusion criteria\nInclusion criteria	Exclusion criteria	 	Study population:People living with HIV, sex workers, transpeople, men who have sex with men, people who use drugs or people in prisons.People who belong to more than one group listed above.	People whose HIV status or belonging to a key population is unknown or not specified.	 	Study design:The following designs IF they report on self-stigma as an outcome:Randomised controlled trials.Controlled clinical trials.Prospective controlled cohort studies.Retrospective controlled cohort studies if baseline exposure data were collected at time of baseline of study.Controlled before and after studies including econometric studies.Interrupted time series studies.	Qualitative studies.Observational studies that do not assess any intervention effects.Cross-sectional studies.Psychometric studies validating self-stigma measurements but not assessing intervention effects.Prevalence studies that do not assess intervention effects.	 	Outcome measureOne or more measures of self-stigma relating to HIV status or other infectious diseases among key populations, sex work, drug use, male-to-male intercourse, transgender identity or expression, incarceration.Multidimensional stigma outcome measure that differentiates between self-stigma and other types of stigma (ie, enacted stigma) when reporting intervention effects.	A multidimensional stigma outcome measure without differentiation between enacted stigma and self-stigma, making it impossible to infer intervention effects on self-stigma.	 	\nStudy selection process\nFollowing Cochrane Collaboration guidelines, search results were merged and de-duplicated. The initial screening involved examination of titles and abstracts by two review authors (JP, JIS) to remove irrelevant reports. Ten per cent of retrieved records were double-screened and yielded high inter-rater reliability (&gt;0.95). Screening of the remaining records was split between both review authors. Full-text documents were retrieved for potentially relevant reports and examined in detail for compliance with eligibility criteria (see above). Where appropriate, authors (corresponding authors and coauthors if contact information could be retrieved) were contacted with up to three follow-up emails over the course of 5 months to clarify study eligibility and request additional information or data.\nData extraction and quality appraisal\nThe data extraction form was adapted from the template and guidelines provided by Cochrane Collaboration. Each included study was independently reviewed by two or more authors (JP, JIS and MP). Quality of included studies was assessed using an adapted version of the Cambridge Quality Checklist, which rates evidence based on sampling procedures, participation rates, sample size and statistical power, measurement reliability, population involvement, and credibility of causal inferences drawn (ie, whether data are prospective, change in outcomes is analysed and a counterfactual/control is used). Following guidelines for reporting patient and public involvement in research, we adapted the checklist by additionally extracting information on the involvement of the population of interest in the research design and implementation. For randomised controlled trials, quality appraisal was further augmented with the Cochrane Risk of Bias Assessment Tool to account for potential flaws in the experimental design. A percentage score for each study was computed based on the study's total score across both appraisal tools. A detailed description of the quality assessment tool and individual study ratings is provided in online supplementary file 2.\nData synthesis\nA meta-analysis was not conducted due to heterogeneity in self-stigma measures, intervention type and study design. However, whenever possible, standardised effect sizes were calculated, allowing for comparisons in magnitude of effects across included studies. Standardised mean differences (Cohen's d) were calculated wherever sufficient data were available. For cluster-randomised controlled trials that did not account for clustering, corrections were made by multiplying SEs with the variance inflation factor as suggested by Littell and colleagues. \nLastly, a narrative synthesis was conducted following Bronfrenbrenner's ecological framework of human development, which has previously been used for examining internalised stigma among same-sex couples in the USA. For the narrative synthesis, interventions were clustered based on the highest socioecological level of risk or resilience that the intervention targeted: microsystem or individual level, mesosystem or relational level, and macrosystem or structural level. Consistency, direction and strength of effects were reported for each of these clusters.\nResults\nStudy characteristics\nOf 5877 potentially relevant titles, 20 unique studies were included in the review. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses flow diagram, including reasons for study exclusion, is provided in figure 1. Represented in the included studies are 9426 people in Uganda, Lesotho, Malawi, Ethiopia, South Africa, Swaziland, Tanzania, Kenya, Thailand, China, Vietnam, India and Nepal. Seventeen of the studies recruited people living with HIV (of which five focused specifically on pregnant women). The remaining three studies focused on young men who have sex with men, female sex workers and men who inject drugs. \nPreferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses flow diagram.\nIntervention characteristics\nInterventions were broadly grouped based on the socioecological levels of risk they aimed to target: individual, relational + individual, structural + individual, and structural level (figure 2). The following paragraphs describe the specific intervention components in more detail. Table 3 summarises which intervention components were included within individual studies and provides information on intervention dosage, with more detailed information on quality appraisal provided in online supplementary file 2.\nSocioecological levels of risk and resilience targeted within self-stigma interventions.\nCharacteristics of included studies and intervention effects\nStudy reference	Country/Setting	Population	Intervention components and description	Programme dose	Study design	Sample size	Self-stigma measure used	Additional outcomes reported	Time to follow-up	Impact on self-stigma and effect size	 	Interventions targeting only individual-level risks and resilience	 	Low et al	Western Kenya	People living with HIV (mean age: 45)	Behavioural (door-to-door HIV testing aimed to increase testing uptake in the presence of stigma).	18 months.

Health education  included information about living with HIV and treatment regimens. Behaviour change for people living with HIV or key populations  was incorporated in three studies that evaluated interventions aiming to alter behaviours that make individuals more vulnerable to acquiring or transmitting HIV. These included interventions focusing on reducing sexual risk behaviours and alcohol use, or those aiming to improve ART adherence and HIV testing uptake. Stigma coping for people living with HIV and key populations  involved psychoeducational sessions with the purpose of defining stigmatisation and discussing ways of coping with it, combined with health education. One of the studies combined stigma coping with economic strengthening. Finally, psychological support  in the form of counselling and group and individual cognitive-behavioural therapy was examined in three studies.\nRelational-level components were community-wide stigma awareness and reduction campaigns and cognitive-behavioural therapy for partners of women living with HIV. Community-wide stigma awareness and reduction interventions aimed to debunk myths around HIV and raising awareness in the general community. One study included cognitive-behavioural therapy for partners of women living with HIV, which aimed to reduce intimate partner violence, improve communication skills and anger management, and enhance health-seeking behaviours.\nAt the structural level components included social or economic empowerment approaches and ART roll-out. These additionally included individual-level components in eight studies and did not in four. In social empowerment interventions, people living with HIV or key populations were offered skills and opportunities to mobilise, assert their rights, and/or develop and implement their own antistigma interventions. Economic strengthening  interventions offered schemes for savings, housing and nutrition support, and income-generating activities. ART roll-out interventions included ART initiation for treatment-naive people living with HIV or continued ART provision for people who were already on treatment.\nOutcomes\nAll of the self-stigma measures used are listed in table 3. Self-stigma was most commonly measured through previously validated scales for HIV-related stigma, including the HIV/AIDS Stigma Instrument for People Living with HIV scale in seven studies, followed by the Internalized AIDS-Related Scale used in four studies and the Berger Scale used in two studies. Two studies measured self-stigma related to belonging to a key population, specifically self-stigma related to drug use and sex work. No studies explored self-stigma related to hepatitis, TB or other health conditions.\nAside from self-stigma outcomes, studies measured HIV-related outcomes (HIV symptoms, HIV seroconversions, ART adherence, CD4 counts, HIV knowledge, sexual and injection risks for acquiring HIV), psychological outcomes (general mental health, depression, happiness, self-esteem, self-efficacy, positive coping, avoidant coping, hopelessness, aspirations, quality of life, alcohol and drug use), relational outcomes (comfort in public interaction, enacted stigma or discrimination, HIV status disclosure, social support) and empowerment (decision-making power and future-oriented behaviour).\nIntervention effectiveness\nThis section focuses on self-stigma outcomes. Other outcomes recorded in the primary studies were not the scope of this review but are summarised in table 3.\nLess than three-quarters (14/20) of the studies reported significant reductions in self-stigma. Effect sizes were extracted or calculated wherever possible; however, five papers did not provide sufficient information and neither could these be obtained through contacting authors. Most of the interventions included multiple components. They are broadly categorised based on the socioecological levels of risk or resilience that they aimed to target: (1) interventions that only targeted individual-level risk and resilience (but not relational or structural factors); (2) interventions targeting relational and individual factors (but not structural factors); (3) interventions targeting structural and individual factors (but not relational factors); and (4) interventions targeting exclusively structural factors.\nIndividual-level interventions\nThere were five interventions operating solely at the individual level. Behavioural interventions that did not include any other components (three studies) consistently produced no significant changes in self-stigma. One intervention (n=20) focused solely on psychological support (cognitive-behavioural therapy), and it resulted in a significant reduction in self-stigma (d=-1.22, 95% CI -2.17 to 0.26). The remaining studies focused on education related to stigma (including coping) and health, and it did not result in a significant self-stigma reduction. \nInterventions operating at the relational and individual levels\nThere were three studies examining interventions operating at both the relational and individual levels. Two interventions combined stigma reduction in the broader community through awareness raising with individual-level psychoeducational components for men who inject drugs and people living with HIV. Neither of these interventions resulted in significant self-stigma reduction.\nThe remaining intervention used cognitive-behavioural therapy and health education for both women living with HIV and their male partners (separately), combined with psychological support for the women. This intervention resulted in a significant reduction in self-stigma (d=-0.48, 95% CI -0.63 to 0.33).\nInterventions operating at the structural and individual levels\nThere were eight studies examining interventions operating at both the structural and individual levels. They consistently produced significant reductions in self-stigma, irrespective of what components they included. Empowerment interventions consistently resulted in reductions in self-stigma, with standardised effect sizes of d=0.50 in two studies and d&gt;1 in the other two. All interventions that had an economic strengthening component (such as food assistance, income generation, saving promotion) also resulted in significant reductions in self-stigma, with effect sizes ranging from d=-4.60 to d=-0.02. One economic strengthening study reported a statistically significant reduction in self-stigma scores (from 1.6 to 0.05, p&lt;0.001) without sufficient statistical data to calculate the standardised effect size. One study evaluated the effects of combined ART provision with health education and reported significant reductions in self-stigma (although there was insufficient information to calculate the effect size). \nStructural-level interventions\nFour studies examined interventions at the structural level only. Specifically, all of these studies included ART provision:both initiation and continuation. They consistently resulted in reductions in self-stigma over time, with effect sizes ranging from d=-0.59 to d=-0.18. \nStudy quality\nAcross studies, time to follow-up ranged from 1 month to 3 years, with ART-based interventions typically assessed within longer timeframes. For studies with particularly short timelines, it is difficult to establish whether reductions in self-stigma are sustainable over the longer term. In addition, only 4 of 20 studies indicated that sample sizes were determined based on power calculations. Lastly, half of the included studies (10/20) reported whether and how the population of interest was engaged in the research beyond mere participation.\nThere was substantial heterogeneity in the quality of included studies, with quality scores ranging from 30% to 78%. Half of the included studies (10/20) were randomised controlled trials. As a standard, the impact of ART provision on self-stigma was assessed within prospective cohort studies, as withholding life-saving treatment from people living with HIV would be ethically unacceptable. Overall study quality was rated as medium to high for studies evaluating pure behavioural interventions, ART provision, relational interventions and economic strengthening. In contrast, quality of evidence was limited by small sample sizes for stigma-related education, stand-alone psychological therapy and social empowerment interventions; hence, further studies are needed for more conclusive and robust inferences.\nDiscussion\nThis is the first systematic review of interventions aiming to reduce self-stigma among people living with HIV or affected by HIV. We identified a wide range of interventions that aimed to address individual, relational and structural risk and resilience factors. Despite the nascent state of the literature, several consistent findings offer direction for policy and programming.\nWhat worked?\nWe found considerable evidence in support of structural interventions or interventions aiming to mitigate structural risks, within methodologically strong studies. These approaches included economic strengthening, social empowerment and ART roll-out. ART initiation consistently resulted in reductions in self-stigma, which is in line with systematic review-level evidence indicating that improvements in HIV-related health outcomes can drive reductions in self-stigma. Therefore, a cyclical relationship between self-stigma and ART use is likely, whereby ART uptake reduces self-stigma but persistent self-stigma compromises ART adherence. \nStructural interventions that focused on empowerment and/or economic strengthening components consistently appeared to be effective in reducing self-stigma. They additionally included individual-level components such as health and/or stigma education, ART support or counselling, making it difficult to identify the 'active' component of the intervention in the absence of multiarm factorial designs. Yet it may be worth noting that interventions combining structural-level and individual-level components had stronger effects on stigma reductions than structural-only interventions (the latter were all ART-provision interventions). This is in line with recent epidemiological and theoretical work which suggests that self-stigma is shaped by factors operating both at the individual (mental health) and structural (poverty) levels. The broader literature on mental health also points to the role of structural-level risks in psychological distress. For example, a recent meta-analysis found that income inequality at the national level was associated with higher risk of depression, with a pooled risk ratio of 1.19 (95% CI 1.07 to 1.31). The authors 'propose an ecological framework with mechanisms operating at the national level (the neo-material hypothesis), neighbourhood level (the social capital and the social comparison hypotheses) and individual level (psychological stress and social defeat hypotheses) to explain this association'. Similar pathways are plausible in the production of self-stigma among people living with or affected by HIV, and more research on multilevel interventions is needed.\nHigh variability in the content of these interventions limits inferences for programme implementation. For example, economic strengthening interventions ranged from food assistance to financial literacy, while empowerment interventions included autonomy, community activism, and people living with HIV designing and implementing stigma reduction interventions. More research is essential to unpack which empowerment and economic strengthening interventions are suitable under what circumstances and for whom. For example, multiarm trials and mediation analyses could help identify active intervention components and mechanisms of effect. Despite these nuances, we found a reasonable amount of consistent and robust evidence suggesting that interventions that effectively buffer against structural risks and enhance individual-level resilience are likely to have a substantial impact on reducing self-stigma.\nCognitive-behavioural therapy appeared to be the only effective intervention at the individual level and at the relational and individual levels combined. At the solely individual level, one study offered cognitive-behavioural therapy to a small sample of people living with HIV. At the relational and individual levels, one study combined cognitive-behavioural therapy with health education for a large sample of both women living with HIV and their male partners (separately), in addition to psychological support for the women. Providing cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) to both women living with HIV and their partners, with a focus on anger management for the partners, may have produced self-stigma both directly by improving the women's mental health, and indirectly by reducing emotional and physical violence victimisation. \nBoth of the CBT studies scored highly on quality assessment, with the individual-level one having a small sample size (n=20). Given the scarcity of research on the effectiveness of CBT to reduce self-stigma, more research on this is needed to inform decisions about scale-up. For example, more research is needed to evaluate effectiveness of CBT when delivered by trained lay professionals and online counselling services, which might address shortages in clinical psychologists in many resource-limited settings.\nWhat did not work, or had insufficient evidence in support of it?\nIt is also important to highlight what did not appear to be effective. However, it should also be noted that for studies that did not report on sample size calculations, there is a high risk of type II error, making it difficult to establish whether they were truly ineffective or simply underpowered to detect changes in self-stigma.\nAll interventions focusing solely on individual-level risk and resilience factors, except for CBT, appeared to be ineffective. Specifically, all three behavioural interventions that aimed to change individuals' healthcare behaviours (HIV risks, HIV testing and ART adherence) and did not include any other components consistently produced no significant changes in self-stigma. Two of these studies were well powered, rendering type II error highly unlikely. Evidence suggests that self-stigma acts as a barrier to HIV testing, status disclosure and ART adherence. In light of this, behavioural interventions that result in short-term HIV risk reduction may not be sustainable if they fail to address self-stigma.\nLikewise, studies focusing solely on education related to stigma and/or health did not result in significant self-stigma reductions. This applies to both interventions aiming to raise awareness among individuals who have internalised stigma and among the broader community, suggesting that neither individual-level nor community-level knowledge around HIV and stigma is sufficient to combat self-stigma. These findings are in line with systematic review-level evidence of interventions to reduce self-stigma among people living with mental health difficulties, which suggest that psychoeducational interventions are largely ineffective for reducing self-stigma. \nKnowledge gaps and recommendations for research\nThis systematic review found that more than a quarter of examined interventions were ineffective in reducing self-stigma. This points to the complexity in achieving impact on self-stigma reductions and highlights the need for rigorous evaluations when implementing.\nNotable gaps in the evidence base were identified and more research is urgently needed to address them. First, the vast majority of research focused on general populations of people living with HIV or pregnant women living with HIV. Of the three studies focusing on key populations, only one effectively reduced self-stigma. Only one study focusing on young people was identified, despite evidence of high levels of self-stigma in this group. The study aimed to reduce self-stigma among young men who have sex with men in Thailand but did not result in significant reductions in self-stigma. The intervention focused on behaviour change through motivational interviewing:it resulted in significant reductions in sexual risk behaviour, and no changes in adherence, alcohol and drug use, and general mental health.\nNone of the studies reported on intersectional stigmas, which occurs when different types of stigma are compounded due to belonging to more than one marginalised social group. Evidence suggests that intersectional self-stigma is common among people living with HIV and affected by HIV, but it remains unknown how to address this issue and support people with intersecting vulnerabilities. Intervention research on this is clearly needed. None of the studies examined self-stigma related to TB, viral hepatitis or other infectious diseases that are common among people living with or affected by HIV. South Africa's current National Strategic Plan for HIV, TB and sexually transmitted infections recognises both HIV-related and TB-related self-stigma as major public health concerns. As such, it aims to halve both HIV-related and TB-related self-stigma by 2022. Evidence is urgently needed to inform ambitious goals such as this one.\nOnly half of the studies reported on community engagement in the intervention design or research process (online supplementary file 2), despite increasing calls for this by the British Medical Journal Patient and Public Partnership initiative and others. Failure to report on community engagement in the research process does not necessarily mean that the researchers did not engage with the community. But without reporting on this, it is impossible to infer whether and to what extent this happened. While examining this in detail was not within the scope of the review, findings suggest a need for more accountability on this within academic publishing. For example, standard reporting guidelines on community engagement would allow for more transparency and clarity on whether and how this occurs in practice. \nLimitations\nA few limitations of this systematic review should be noted. First, it is possible that more studies with null effects on self-stigma exist but remain unpublished due to the file drawer problem. However, by specifically screening grey literature data and contacting key authors in this research field, we were able to identify two (yet) unpublished studies. Second, due to the heterogeneity of interventions and outcomes, we were not able to conduct a meta-analysis. However, whenever possible, standardised effect sizes were calculated and presented in a summary table to allow readers to compare effects between studies. Lastly, while no language restrictions were enforced, all searches were conducted in English and we did not identify any documents in other languages.\nConclusions\nThis systematic review provides an unprecedented overview of evidence on interventions aiming to reduce self-stigma among people living with and affected by HIV in LMICs. Findings suggest that interventions aiming to buffer against structural stressors hold promise for reducing self-stigma. In particular, interventions focusing on social empowerment, economic strengthening and ART scale-up may substantially reduce self-stigma among individuals living with or affected by HIV. We found little evidence in support of individual-level interventions such as those focusing on health behaviour change, individuals coping with stigma or awareness raising. The only individual-level intervention that appeared to be effective (within a limited number of studies) was cognitive-behavioural therapy. More research is urgently needed to understand what works among key populations affected by HIV and young people, as well as what approaches might help reduce intersectional self-stigma.\nHandling editor: Seye Abimbola\nTwitter: New #systematicreview by @PantelichMarija et al. identifies what works to address self #stigma among people living with and affected by #HIV in resource-limited settings.\nContributors: MP conceptualised the study with input from SM.

systematic review and meta-synthesis","abstract":"Introduction\nAdherence to HIV antiretroviral therapy (ART) is a critical determinant of HIV-1 RNA viral suppression and health outcomes.\n\n It is generally accepted that HIV-related stigma is correlated with factors that may undermine ART adherence, but its relationship with ART adherence itself is not well established.\n\n We therefore undertook this review to systematically assess the relationship between HIV-related stigma and ART adherence.\n\n\nMethods\nWe searched nine electronic databases for published and unpublished literature, with no language restrictions.\n\n First we screened the titles and abstracts for studies that potentially contained data on ART adherence.\n\n Then we reviewed the full text of these studies to identify articles that reported data on the relationship between ART adherence and either HIV-related stigma or serostatus disclosure.\n\n We used the method of meta-synthesis to summarize the findings from the qualitative studies.\n\n\nResults\nOur search protocol yielded 14,854 initial records.\n\n After eliminating duplicates and screening the titles and abstracts, we retrieved the full text of 960 journal articles, dissertations and unpublished conference abstracts for review.\n\n We included 75 studies conducted among 26,715 HIV-positive persons living in 32 countries worldwide, with less representation of work from Eastern Europe and Central Asia.\n\n Among the 34 qualitative studies, our meta-synthesis identified five distinct third-order labels through an inductive process that we categorized as themes and organized in a conceptual model spanning intrapersonal, interpersonal and structural levels.\n\n HIV-related stigma undermined ART adherence by compromising general psychological processes, such as adaptive coping and social support.\n\n We also identified psychological processes specific to HIV-positive persons driven by predominant stigmatizing attitudes and which undermined adherence, such as internalized stigma and concealment.\n\n Adaptive coping and social support were critical determinants of participants ability to overcome the structural and economic barriers associated with poverty in order to successfully adhere to ART.\n\n Among the 41 quantitative studies, 24 of 33 cross-sectional studies (71%) reported a positive finding between HIV stigma and ART non-adherence, while 6 of 7 longitudinal studies (86%) reported a null finding (Pearson's ?\n2=7.7; p=0.005).\n\n\nConclusions\nWe found that HIV-related stigma compromised participants abilities to successfully adhere to ART.\n\n Interventions to reduce stigma should target multiple levels of influence (intrapersonal, interpersonal and structural) in order to have maximum effectiveness on improving ART adherence.\n\n\n","id":"PMC3833107","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"International AIDS Society","authors":[{"firstname":"Ingrid

practitioners within the HIV treatment as prevention trial communities in rural South Africa (ANRS 12249 TasP trial)","abstract":"id='P2'>The ANRS 12249 Treatment-as-Prevention (TasP) cluster-randomized trial in rural South Africa uses a test and treat approach.\n Home-based testing services and antiretroviral treatment initiation satellite clinics were implemented in every cluster as part of the trial.\n A social science research agenda was nested within TasP with the aim of understanding the social, economic and contextual factors that affect individuals, households, communities and health systems with respect to TasP.\n Considering the rural nature of the trial setting, we sought to understand community perceptions and experiences of the TasP Trial interventions as seen through the eyes of traditional health practitioners (THPs).\n A qualitative study design was adopted using four repeat focus group discussions conducted with nine THPs, combined with community walks and photo-voice techniques, over a period of 18 months.\n A descriptive, interpretive and explanatory approach to analysis was adopted.\n Findings indicate that THPs engaged with the home-based testing services and HIV clinics established for TasP.\n Specifically, home-based testing services were perceived as relatively successful in increasing access to HIV testing.\n A major gap observed by THPs was linkage to HIV clinics.\n Most of their clients, and some of the THPs themselves, found it difficult to use HIV clinics due to fear of labelling, stigma and discrimination, and the ensuing personal implications of unsolicited disclosure.\n On the one hand, a growing number of patients diagnosed with HIV have found sanctuary with THPs as alternatives to clinics.\n On the other hand, THPs in turn have been struggling to channel patients suspected of HIV into clinics through referrals.\n Therefore, acceptability of the TasP test and treat approach by THPs is a major boost to the intervention, but further success can be achieved through strengthened ties with communities to combat stigma and effectively link patients into HIV care, including partnerships with THPs themselves.\n","id":"PMC5096678","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Health Systems

life (HRQoL).\n\n Weight bias internalization (WBI) is prevalent in this population and strongly associated with psychopathology and health status.\n\n However, the psychological mechanisms underlying the relationship between WBI and the physical and mental dimensions of HRQoL remain to be clarified.\n\n\nMethods\nid='Par2'>A preoperative sample of patients with obesity (N?=?246; women?=?75.2%; Mage?=?32.07) completed validated measures as part of a routine preoperative psychological assessment to assess their WBI, self-esteem, anxiety symptoms, depressive symptoms, and HRQoL.\n\n\nResults\nid='Par3'>After controlling for the effects of gender, age, and BMI, WBI was linked to poorer physical and mental HRQoL through low self-esteem and increased psychological distress, including anxiety and depressive symptoms.\n\n\nConclusion\nid='Par4'>In pre-bariatric surgery patients with obesity, high WBI may predict impairments in mental and physical HRQoL by lowering self-esteem, and further increasing anxiety and depressive symptoms.\n\n Interventions targeting WBI may be an important aspect to consider in the clinical treatment of pre-bariatric surgery patients.\n\n Further longitudinal studies are warranted to determine causality.\n\n\nGraphical abstract\nid='Par5'>\n\n","id":"PMC9613576","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Springer

identification of effective interventions to reduce stigma and discrimination that can be integrated into national responses is crucial to the success of the global AIDS response.\n\n\nMethods\nWe conducted a systematic review of studies and reports that assessed the effectiveness of interventions to reduce HIV stigma and discrimination between 1 January 2002 and 1 March 2013. Databases searched for peer-reviewed articles included PubMed, Scopus, EBSCO Host CINAHL Plus, Psycinfo, Ovid, Sociofile and Popline.\n\n Reports were obtained from the www.\n\nHIVAIDSClearinghouse.\n\neu, USAID Development Experience Clearinghouse, UNESCO HIV and AIDS Education Clearinghouse, Google, WHO and UNAIDS.\n\n Ancestry searches for articles included in the systematic review were also conducted.\n\n Studies of any design that sought to reduce stigma as a primary or secondary objective and included pre- and post-intervention measures of stigma were included.\n\n\nResults\nOf 2368 peer-reviewed articles and reports identified, 48 were included in our review representing 14 different target populations in 28 countries.\n\n The majority of interventions utilized two or more strategies to reduce stigma and discrimination, and ten included structural or biomedical components.\n\n However, most interventions targeted a single socio-ecological level and a single domain of stigma.\n\n Outcome measures lacked uniformity and validity, making both interpretation and comparison of study results difficult.\n\n While the majority of studies were effective at reducing the aspects of stigma they measured, none assessed the influence of stigma or discrimination reduction on HIV-related health outcomes.\n\n\nConclusions\nOur review revealed considerable progress in the stigma-reduction field.\n\n However, critical challenges and gaps remain which are impeding the identification of effective stigma-reduction strategies that can be implemented by national governments on a larger scale.\n\n The development, validation, and consistent use of globally relevant scales of stigma and discrimination are a critical next step for advancing the field of research in this area.\n\n Studies comparing the effectiveness of different stigma-reduction strategies and studies assessing the influence of stigma reduction on key behavioural and biomedical outcomes are also needed to maximize biomedical prevention efforts.\n\n\n","id":"PMC3833106","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"International AIDS Society","authors":[{"firstname":"Anne L","surname":"Stangl","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jennifer K","surname":"Lloyd","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Laura M","surname":"Brady","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Claire E","surname":"Holland","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Stefan","surname":"Baral","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}],"References depth 2":[{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"The influence of AIDS stigma and discrimination and social cohesion on HIV testing and willingness to disclose HIV in rural KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"When do HIV-infected women disclose their HIV status to their male partner and why?

to prevent abuse of adolescents in South Africa: study protocol for a randomised controlled trial","abstract":"Background\nAn estimated one billion children experience child abuse each year, with the highest rates in low- and middle-income countries.\n\n The Sinovuyo Teen programme is part of Parenting for Lifelong Health, a WHO/UNICEF initiative to develop and test violence-prevention programmes for implementation in low-resource contexts.\n\n The objectives of this parenting support programme are to prevent the abuse of adolescents, improve parenting and reduce adolescent behavioural problems.\n\n This trial aims to evaluate the effectiveness of Sinovuyo Teen compared to an attention-control group of a water hygiene programme.\n\n\nMethods/Design\nThis is a pragmatic cluster randomised controlled trial, with stratified randomisation of 37 settlements (rural and peri-urban) with 40 study clusters in the Eastern Cape of South Africa.\n\n Settlements receive either a 14-session parenting support programme or a 1-day water hygiene programme.\n\n The primary outcomes are child abuse and parenting practices, and secondary outcomes include adolescent behavioural problems, mental health and social support.\n\n Concurrent process evaluation and qualitative research are conducted.\n\n Outcomes are reported by both primary caregivers and adolescents.\n\n Brief follow-up measures are collected immediately after the intervention, and full follow-up measures collected at 38 months post-intervention.\n\n A 1524-month follow-up is planned, but this will depend on the financial and practical feasibility given delays related to high levels of ongoing civil and political violence in the research sites.\n\n\nDiscussion\nThis is the first known trial of a parenting programme to prevent abuse of adolescents in a low- or middle-income country.\n\n The study will also examine potential mediating pathways and moderating factors.\n\n\nTrial

child abuse amongst adolescents in low- and middle-income countries: A pre-post trial in South Africa","abstract":"Background\nNo known studies have tested the effectiveness of child abuse prevention programmes for adolescents in low- or middle-income countries.\n\n Parenting for Lifelong Health (http://tiny.\n\ncc/whoPLH) is a collaborative project to develop and rigorously test abuse-prevention parenting programmes for free use in low-resource contexts.\n\n Research aims of this first pre-post trial in South Africa were: i) to identify indicative effects of the programme on child abuse and related outcomes; ii) to investigate programme safety for testing in a future randomised trial, and iii) to identify potential adaptations.\n\n\nMethods\nTwo hundred thirty participants (adolescents and their primary caregivers) were recruited from schools, welfare services and community-sampling in rural, high-poverty South Africa (no exclusion criteria).\n\n All participated in a 12-week parenting programme, implemented by local NGO childcare workers to ensure real-world external validity.\n\n Standardised pre-post measures with adolescents and caregivers were used, and paired t-tests were conducted for primary outcomes: abuse (physical, emotional abuse and neglect), adolescent behaviour problems and parenting (positive and involved parenting, poor monitoring and inconsistent discipline), and secondary outcomes: mental health, social support and substance use.\n\n\nResults\nParticipants reported high levels of socio-economic deprivation, e.\n\ng.\n\n 60 % of adolescents had either an HIV-positive caregiver or were orphaned by AIDS, and 50 % of caregivers experienced intimate partner violence.\n\n i) indicative effects: Primary outcomes comparing pre-test and post-test assessments showed reductions reported by adolescents and caregivers in child abuse (adolescent report 63.0 % pre-test to 29.5 % post-test, caregiver report 75.5 % pre-test to 36.5 % post-test, both p?&lt;?0.001) poor monitoring/inconsistent discipline (p?&lt;?.\n\n001), adolescent delinquency/aggressive behaviour (both p?&lt;?.\n\n001), and improvements in positive/involved parenting (p?&lt;?.\n\n01 adolescent report, p?&lt;?.\n\n001 caregiver report).\n\n Secondary outcomes showed improved social support (p?&lt;?.\n\n001 adolescent and caregiver reports), reduced parental and adolescent depression (both p?&lt;?.\n\n001), parenting stress (p?&lt;?.\n\n001 caregiver report) and caregiver substance use (p?&lt;?.\n\n002 caregiver report).\n\n There were no changes in adolescent substance use.\n\n No negative effects were detected.\n\n ii) Programme acceptability and attendance was high.\n\n There was unanticipated programme diffusion within some study villages, with families initiating parenting groups in churches, and diffusion through school assemblies and religious sermons.\n\n iii) potential adaptations identified included the need to strengthen components on adolescent substance use and to consider how to support spontaneous programme diffusion with fidelity.\n\n\nConclusions\nThe programme showed no signs of harm and initial evidence of reductions in child abuse and improved caregiver and adolescent outcomes.\n\n It showed high acceptability and unexpected community-level diffusion.\n\n Findings indicate needs for adaptations, and suitability for the next research step of more rigorous testing in randomised trials, using cluster randomization to allow for diffusion effects.\n\n\n","id":"PMC5137206","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"BioMed

Scale for South African Adolescents Living with HIV (ALHIV-SS)","abstract":"id='Par1'>Sub-Saharan Africa is home to 90 % of the worlds adolescents living with HIV (ALHIV).\n HIV-stigma and the resultant fear of being identified as HIV-positive can compromise the survival of these youth by undermining anti-retroviral treatment initiation and adherence.\n To date, no HIV-stigma measures have been validated for use with ALHIV in Sub-Saharan Africa.\n This paper reports on a two-stage study in the Eastern Cape, South Africa.\n Firstly, we conducted a cross-cultural adaptation of an HIV stigma scale, previously used with US ALHIV.\n One-on-one semi-structured cognitive interviews were conducted with 9 urban and rural ALHIV.\n Three main themes emerged: 1) participants spoke about experiences of HIV stigma specific to a Southern African context, such as anticipating stigma from community members due to punishment from God or ancestors; 2) participants responses uncovered discrepancies between what the items intended to capture and how they understood them and 3) participants interpretation of wording uncovered redundant items.\n Items were revised or removed in consultation with participants.\n Secondly, we psychometrically assessed and validated this adapted ALHIV stigma scale (ALHIV-SS).\n We used total population sampling in 53 public healthcare facilities with community tracing.\n 721 ALHIV who were fully aware of their status were identified and interviewed for the psychometric assessment.\n Confirmatory factor analysis confirmed a 3-factor structure of enacted, anticipated and internalized stigma.\n The removal of 3 items resulted in a significant improvement in model fit (Chi\n2\n(df)?=?189.83 (33), p?&lt;?.\n001) and the restricted model fitted the data well (RMSEA?=?.\n017; CFI/TLI?=?.\n985/.\n980; SRMR?=?.\n032).\n Standardized factor loadings of indicators onto the latent variable were acceptable for all three measures (.\n41.\n96).\n Concurrent criterion validity confirmed hypothesized relationships.\n Enacted stigma was associated with higher AIDS symptomatology (r?=?.\n146, p?&lt;?.\n01) and depression (r?=?.\n092, p?&lt;?.\n01).\n Internalized stigma was correlated with higher depression (r?=?.\n340, p?&lt;?.\n01), higher AIDS symptomatology (r?=?.\n228, p?&lt;?.\n01) and low social support (r?=??.\n265, p?&lt;?.\n01).\n Anticipated stigma was associated with higher depression (r?=?.\n203, p?&lt;?.\n01) and lower social support (r?=??.\n142, p?&lt;?.\n01).\n The resulting ALHIV-SS has 10 items capturing all three HIV stigma mechanisms experienced by ALHIV.\n ALHIV-SS will be valuable for evaluating rates and types of stigma, as well as effectiveness of stigma-reduction interventions among ALHIV in Southern Africa.\n","id":"PMC5816760","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Springer

criminalized or stigmatized.\n By catering to the specific needs of each KP individual, differentiated approaches may increase service acceptability, quality and coverage, reduce costs and support KP

tuberculosis (TB) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) co-infection on perceived stigma is not well studied.\n\n The objective of this study was to assess the effect of TB/HIV co-infection on perceived stigma in selected hospitals of Oromiya region, Ethiopia.\n\n A cross sectional study was conducted from February to April, 2009 in Adama, Nekemet and Jimma Specialized hospitals.\n\n Data were collected by trained HIV counselors.\n\n A structured questionnaire which consisted of socio-demographic variables, clinical information, perceived stigma, and depression was used to collect the data\nFindings\nA total of 591 participants were included in the study of whom 124 (20.9%) were co-infected with TB/HIV.\n\n The stigma items were highly reliable (Cronbach's alpha = 0.93) and had strong inter dimension correlation.\n\n Respondents who were co-infected with TB and HIV were more likely to have perceived stigma compared to non-co-infected HIV patients, [OR = 1.4, (95% CI: 1.2, 2.0)].\n\n Non-literate individuals [OR = 1.9, (95% CI: 1.2, 3.0)] and females [OR = 1.6, (95% CI: 1.2, 2.3)] had also more perceived stigma.\n\n\nConclusions\nTB/HIV co-infected patients, non-literate individuals and females were more likely to have high perceived stigma.\n\n Behavioral Change Communication should focus on these segments of the population to rectify the high perceived stigma.\n\n\n","id":"PMC2966463","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"BioMed

of a Multi-level Intervention to Reduce Injecting and Sexual Risk Behaviors among HIV-Infected People Who Inject Drugs in Vietnam: A Four-Arm Randomized Controlled Trial","abstract":"Introduction\nInjecting drug use is a primary driver of HIV epidemics in many countries.\n\n People who inject drugs (PWID) and are HIV infected are often doubly stigmatized and many encounter difficulties reducing risk behaviors.\n\n Prevention interventions for HIV-infected PWID that provide enhanced support at the individual, family, and community level to facilitate risk-reduction are needed.\n\n\nMethods\n455 HIV-infected PWID and 355 of their HIV negative injecting network members living in 32 sub-districts in Thai Nguyen Province were enrolled.\n\n We conducted a two-stage randomization: First, sub-districts were randomized to either a community video screening and house-to-house visits or standard of care educational pamphlets.\n\n Second, within each sub-district, participants were randomized to receive either enhanced individual level post-test counseling and group support sessions or standard of care HIV testing and counseling.\n\n This resulted in four arms: 1) standard of care; 2) community level intervention; 3) individual level intervention; and 4) community plus individual intervention.\n\n Follow-up was conducted at 6, 12, 18, and 24 months.\n\n Primary outcomes were self-reported HIV injecting and sexual risk behaviors.\n\n Secondary outcomes included HIV incidence among HIV negative network members.\n\n\nResults\nFewer participants reported sharing injecting equipment and unprotected sex from baseline to 24 months in all arms (77% to 4% and 24% to 5% respectively).\n\n There were no significant differences at the 24-month visit among the 4 arms (Wald = 3.40 (3 df); p = 0.33; Wald = 6.73 (3 df); p = 0.08).\n\n There were a total of 4 HIV seroconversions over 24 months with no significant difference between intervention and control arms.\n\n\nDiscussion\nUnderstanding the mechanisms through which all arms, particularly the control arm, demonstrated both low risk behaviors and low HIV incidence has important implications for policy and prevention programming.\n\n\nTrial Registration\nClinicalTrials.\n\ngov NCT01689545\n\n","id":"PMC4444299","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Public

antiretroviral therapy (HAART) on health-related quality of life (QOL) of HIV-1 infected individuals in large prospective cohorts has not been well studied.\n\n\nObjective\nTo assess the effect of HAART on QOL by comparing HIV-infected women using HAART with HIV-infected women remaining HAART naïve in the Women's Interagency HIV Study (WIHS), a multicenter prospective cohort study begun in 1994 in the US.\n\n\nMethods\nA 1:1 matching with equivalent (? 0.1%) propensity scores for predicting HAART initiation was implemented and 458 pairs were obtained.\n\n HAART effects were assessed using pattern mixture models.\n\n The changes of nine QOL domain scores and one summary score derived from a shortened version of the MOS-HIV from initial values were used as study outcomes.\n\n\nResults\nThe background covariates of the treatment groups were well-balanced after propensity score matching.\n\n The 916 matched subjects had a mean age of 38.5 years and 42% had a history of AIDS diagnosis.\n\n The participants contributed a total of 4,292 person visits with a median follow-up time of 4 years.\n\n In the bivariate analyses with only HAART use and time as covariates, HAART was associated with short-term improvements of 4 QOL domains: role functioning, social functioning, pain and perceived health index.\n\n After adjusting for demographic, socioeconomic, biological and clinical variables, HAART had small but significant short-term improvements on changes in summary QOL (mean change: 3.25; P = 0.02), role functioning (6.99; P &lt; 0.01), social functioning (5.74; P &lt; 0.01), cognitive functioning (3.59; P = 0.03), pain (6.73; P &lt; 0.01), health perception (3.67; P = 0.03) and perceived health index (4.87; P &lt; 0.01).\n\n These QOL scores typically remained stable or declined over additional follow-up and there was no indication that HAART modified these trends.\n\n\nConclusion\nOur study demonstrated significant short-term HAART effects on most QOL domains, but additional use of HAART did not modify long-term trends.\n\n These changes could be attributed to the direct effect of HAART and indirect HAART effect mediated through clinical changes.\n\n\n","id":"PMC1459186","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"BioMed

treatment-adherent, successfully treated HIV patients and to examine the relationships between psychosocial variables.\n The sample was composed of 133 persons living with HIV, with optimal adherence to antiretroviral therapy and with no detectable viral load.\n The psychosocial profile of the cohort showed that participants had moderate levels of stress, used a wide range of strategies to adjust to their situation and perceived their social support to be good.\n As well, they evaluated their quality of life (Medical Outcome Study-HIV) as moderate.\n Quality of life in psychological domain is largely explained by perceived stress (53%).\n Quality of life in physical domain is largely dependent on discomfort reported arising from HIV-associated symptoms and treatment (39%).\n Findings suggest that treatment-adherent, successfully treated patients with HIV are still a fragile population, and that it is essential to provide interventions that reinforce their ways of coping.\n","id":"PMC2698420","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Bentham

challenge associated with the treatment of HIV.\n\n Although different adherence-supporting interventions have been reported, their long term feasibility in low income settings remains uncertain.\n\n Thus, there is a need to explore sustainable contextual adherence aids in such settings, and to test these using rigorous scientific designs.\n\n The current ubiquity of mobile phones in many resource-constrained settings, make it a contextually appropriate and relatively low cost means of supporting adherence.\n\n In India, mobile phones have wide usage and acceptability and are potentially feasible tools for enhancing adherence to medications.\n\n This paper presents the study protocol for a trial, to evaluate the influence of mobile phone reminders on adherence to first-line antiretroviral treatment in South India.\n\n\nMethods/Design\n600 treatment naïve patients eligible for first-line treatment as per the national antiretroviral treatment guidelines will be recruited into the trial at two clinics in South India.\n\n Patients will be randomized into control and intervention arms.\n\n The control arm will receive the standard of care; the intervention arm will receive the standard of care plus mobile phone reminders.\n\n Each reminder will take the form of an automated call and a picture message.\n\n Reminders will be delivered once a week, at a time chosen by the patient.\n\n Patients will be followed up for 24 months or till the primary outcome i.\n\ne.\n\n virological failure, is reached, whichever is earlier.\n\n Self-reported adherence is a secondary outcome.\n\n Analysis is by intention-to-treat.\n\n A cost-effectiveness study of the intervention will also be carried out.\n\n\nDiscussion\nStepping up telecommunications technology in resource-limited healthcare settings is a priority of the World Health Organization.\n\n The trial will evaluate if the use of mobile phone reminders can influence adherence to first-line antiretrovirals in an Indian context.\n\n\nTrial Registration\nTrial registration: ISRCTN79261738.\n","id":"PMC2858730","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"BioMed

Quantitative and qualitative studies were included that met pre-defined criteria.\n\n Antiretroviral (ARV) prophylaxis (maternal/infant) and combination antiretroviral therapy (ART) usage/registration at HIV care and treatment during pregnancy were included as outcomes.\n\n\nResults\nOf 574 references identified, 40 met the inclusion criteria.\n\n Four references were added after searching reference lists of included articles.\n\n Twenty studies were quantitative, 16 were qualitative and eight were mixed methods.\n\n Forty-one studies were conducted in Southern and East Africa, two in West Africa, none in Central Africa and one was multi-regional.\n\n The majority (n=25) were conducted before combination ART for PMTCT was emphasized in 2006. At the individual-level, poor knowledge of HIV/ART/vertical transmission, lower maternal educational level and psychological issues following HIV diagnosis were the key barriers identified.\n\n Stigma and fear of status disclosure to partners, family or community members (community-level factors) were the most frequently cited barriers overall and across time.\n\n The extent of partner/community support was another major factor impeding or facilitating the uptake of PMTCT ARVs, while cultural traditions including preferences for traditional healers and birth attendants were also common.\n\n Key health-systems issues included poor staff-client interactions, staff shortages, service accessibility and non-facility deliveries.\n\n\nConclusions\nLong-standing health-systems issues (such as staffing and service accessibility) and community-level factors (particularly stigma, fear of disclosure and lack of partner support) have not changed over time and continue to plague PMTCT programmes more than 10 years after their introduction.\n\n The potential of PMTCT programmes to virtually eliminate vertical transmission of HIV will remain elusive unless these barriers are tackled.\n\n The prominence of community-level factors in this review points to the importance of community-driven approaches to improve uptake of PMTCT interventions, although packages of solutions addressing barriers at different levels will be important.\n\n\n","id":"PMC3717402","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"International AIDS

Studies generally support male involvement to promote PMTCT, but the nature and impact of that involvement is unclear and untested.\n\n Additionally, stigma, disclosure and intimate partner violence pose significant barriers to PMTCT uptake and retention in care, suggesting that male involvement may be necessary, but not sufficient to reduce infant HIV incidence.\n\n This study expands on a successful United States President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR)-supported PMTCT couples intervention pilot study conducted in the Mpumalanga province, targeting HIV-positive pregnant women and their partners, the primary objective being to determine whether male partner involvement plus a behavioral intervention will significantly reduce infant HIV incidence.\n\n\nMethods/design\nThe study follows a cluster randomized controlled design enrolling two cohorts of HIV-positive pregnant women recruited from 12 randomly assigned Community Health Centers (CHC) (six experimental, six control).\n\n The two cohorts will consist of women attending without their male partners (n = 720) and women attending with their male partners (n = 720 couples), in order to determine whether the influence of male participation itself, or combined with a behavioral PMTCT intervention, can significantly reduce infant HIV infection ante-, peri- and postnatally.\n\n\nDiscussion\nIt is our intention to significantly increase PMTCT participation from current levels (69%) in the Mpumalanga province to between 90 and 95% through engaging women and couples in a controlled, six session ante- and postnatal risk-reducing and PMTCT promotion intervention addressing barriers to PMTCT (such as stigma, disclosure, intimate partner violence, communication, infant feeding practices and safer conception) that prevent women and men from utilizing treatment opportunities available to them and their infants.\n\n Based upon the encouraging preliminary results from our pilot study, successful CHC adoption of the program could have major public health policy implications for containing the epidemic among the most vulnerable populations in rural South Africa: HIV-positive pregnant women and their infants.\n\n\nTrial registration\nClinicalTrials.\n\ngov NCT02085356 (registration date: 10 March 2014).\n\n\nElectronic supplementary

Low- and Middle-Income Countries 20002006: A Systematic Review","abstract":"Background\nRecent reports of high HIV infection rates among men who have sex with men (MSM) from Asia, Africa, Latin America, and the former Soviet Union (FSU) suggest high levels of HIV transmission among MSM in low- and middle-income countries.\n\n To investigate the global epidemic of HIV among MSM and the relationship of MSM outbreaks to general populations, we conducted a comprehensive review of HIV studies among MSM in low- and middle-income countries and performed a meta-analysis of reported MSM and reproductive-age adult HIV prevalence data.\n\n\nMethods and Findings\nA comprehensive review of the literature was conducted using systematic methodology.\n\n Data regarding HIV prevalence and total sample size was sequestered from each of the studies that met inclusion criteria and aggregate values for each country were calculated.\n\n Pooled odds ratio (OR) estimates were stratified by factors including HIV prevalence of the country, Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS)classified level of HIV epidemic, geographic region, and whether or not injection drug users (IDUs) played a significant role in given epidemic.\n\n Pooled ORs were stratified by prevalence level; very low-prevalence countries had an overall MSM OR of 58.4 (95% CI 56.360.6); low-prevalence countries, 14.4 (95% CI 13.814.9); and medium- to high-prevalence countries, 9.6 (95% CI 9.010.2).\n\n Significant differences in ORs for HIV infection among MSM in were seen when comparing low- and middle-income countries; low-income countries had an OR of 7.8 (95% CI 7.28.4), whereas middle-income countries had an OR of 23.4 (95% CI 22.824.0).\n\n Stratifying the pooled ORs by whether the country had a substantial component of IDU spread resulted in an OR of 12.8 (95% CI 12.313.4) in countries where IDU transmission was prevalent, and 24.4 (95% CI 23.725.2) where it was not.\n\n By region, the OR for MSM in the Americas was 33.3 (95% CI 32.334.2); 18.7 (95% CI 17.719.7) for Asia; 3.8 (95% CI 3.34.3) for Africa; and 1.3 (95% CI 1.11.6) for the low- and middle-income countries of Europe.\n\n\nConclusions\nMSM have a markedly greater risk of being infected with HIV compared with general population samples from low- and middle-income countries in the Americas, Asia, and Africa.\n\n ORs for HIV infection in MSM are elevated across prevalence levels by country and decrease as general population prevalence increases, but remain 9-fold higher in mediumhigh prevalence settings.\n\n MSM from low- and middle-income countries are in urgent need of prevention and care, and appear to be both understudied and underserved.\n\n\n","id":"PMC2100144","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Public Library of

Medical Care in the United States: Data from the Medical Monitoring Project and the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System","abstract":"Background\nWith increased life expectancy for HIV-infected persons, there is concern regarding comorbid depression because of its common occurrence and association with behaviors that may facilitate HIV transmission.\n\n Our objectives were to estimate the prevalence of current depression among HIV-infected persons receiving care and assess the burden of major depression, relative to that in the general population.\n\n\nMethods and Findings\nWe used data from the Medical Monitoring Project (MMP) and the Behavioral Risk Factors Surveillance System (BRFSS).\n\n The eight-item Patient Health Questionnaire was used to identify depression.\n\n To assess the burden of major depression among HIV-infected persons receiving care, we compared the prevalence of current major depression between the MMP and BRFSS populations using stratified analyses that simultaneously controlled for gender and, in turn, each of the potentially confounding demographic factors of age, race/ethnicity, education, and income.\n\n Each unadjusted comparison was summarized as a prevalence ratio (PR), and each of the adjusted comparisons was summarized as a standardized prevalence ratio (SPR).\n\n Among HIV-infected persons receiving care, the prevalence of a current episode of major depression and other depression, respectively, was 12.4% (95% CI: 11.2, 13.7) and 13.2% (95% CI: 12.0%, 14.4%).\n\n Overall, the PR comparing the prevalence of current major depression between HIV-infected persons receiving care and the general population was 3.1. When controlling for gender and each of the factors age, race/ethnicity, and education, the SPR (3.3, 3.0, and 2.9, respectively) was similar to the PR.\n\n However, when controlling for gender and annual household income, the SPR decreased to 1.5.\nConclusions\nDepression remains a common comorbidity among HIV-infected persons.\n\n The overall excess burden among HIV-infected persons receiving care is about three-times that among the general population and is associated with differences in annual household income between the two populations.\n\n Relevant efforts are needed to reduce this burden.\n\n\n","id":"PMC3963963","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Public Library of Science","authors":[{"firstname":"Ann

2005), CinAhl (inception to June 2005), Cochrane Library (inception to June 2005), Embase (inception to June 2005), ERIC (inception to June 2005), MedLine (inception to June 2005), and NHS EED (inception to June 2005).\n\n We retrieved studies conducted in both developed and developing nation settings that examined barriers and facilitators addressing adherence.\n\n Both qualitative and

in developed nations, while the remaining 12 (two qualitative) were conducted in developing nations.\n\n Important barriers reported in both economic settings included fear of disclosure, concomitant substance abuse, forgetfulness, suspicions of treatment, regimens that are too complicated, number of pills required, decreased quality of life, work and family responsibilities, falling asleep, and access to medication.\n\n Important facilitators reported by patients in developed nation settings included having a sense of self-worth, seeing positive effects of antiretrovirals, accepting their seropositivity, understanding the need for strict adherence, making use of reminder tools, and having a simple regimen.\n\n Among 37 separate meta-analyses examining the generalizability of these findings, we found large heterogeneity.\n\n\nConclusions\nWe found that important barriers to adherence are consistent across multiple settings and countries.\n\n Research is urgently needed to determine patient-important factors for adherence in developing world settings.\n\n Clinicians should use this information to engage in open discussion with patients to promote adherence and identify

programme delivery and outcomes in resource-limited countries: a synthetic review","abstract":"Background\nTask-shifting to lay community health providers is increasingly suggested as a potential strategy to overcome the barriers to sustainable antiretroviral treatment (ART) scale-up in high-HIV-prevalence, resource-limited settings.\n\n The dearth of systematic scientific evidence on the contributory role and function of these forms of community mobilisation has rendered a formal evaluation of the published results of existing community support programmes a research priority.\n\n\nMethods\nWe reviewed the relevant published work for the period from November 2003 to December 2011 in accordance with the guidelines for a synthetic review.\n\n ISI Web of Knowledge, Science Direct, BioMed Central, OVID Medline, PubMed, Social Services Abstracts, and Sociological Abstracts and a number of relevant websites were searched.\n\n\nResults\nThe reviewed literature reported an unambiguous positive impact of community support on a wide range of aspects, including access, coverage, adherence, virological and immunological outcomes, patient retention and survival.\n\n Looking at the mechanisms through which community support can impact ART programmes, the review indicates that community support initiatives are a promising strategy to address five often cited challenges to ART scale-up, namely (1) the lack of integration of ART services into the general health system; (2) the growing need for comprehensive care, (3) patient empowerment, (4) and defaulter tracing; and (5) the crippling shortage in human resources for health.\n\n The literature indicates that by linking HIV/AIDS-care to other primary health care programmes, by providing psychosocial care in addition to the technical-medical care from nurses and doctors, by empowering patients towards self-management and by tracing defaulters, well-organised community support initiatives are a vital part of any sustainable public-sector ART programme.\n\n\nConclusions\nThe review demonstrates that community support initiatives are a potentially effective strategy to address the growing shortage of health workers, and to broaden care to accommodate the needs associated with chronic HIV/AIDS.\n\n The existing evidence suggests that community support programmes, although not necessarily cheap or easy, remain a good investment to improve coverage of communities with much needed health services, such as ART.\n\n For this reason, health policy makers, managers, and providers must acknowledge and strengthen the role of community support in the fight against HIV/AIDS.\n\n\n","id":"PMC3476429","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"BioMed

qualitative evaluation of the PALSA PLUS nurse training programme","abstract":"Background\nSouth Africa recently launched a national antiretroviral treatment programme.\n\n This has created an urgent need for nurse-training in antiretroviral treatment (ART) delivery.\n\n The PALSA PLUS programme provides guidelines and training for primary health care (PHC) nurses in the management of adult lung diseases and HIV/AIDS, including ART.\n\n A process evaluation was undertaken to document the training, explore perceptions regarding the value of the training, and compare the PALSA PLUS training approach (used at intervention sites) with the provincial training model.\n\n The evaluation was conducted alongside a randomized controlled trial measuring the effects of the PALSA PLUS nurse-training (Trial reference number ISRCTN24820584).\n\n\nMethods\nQualitative methods were utilized, including participant observation of training sessions, focus group discussions and interviews.\n\n Data were analyzed thematically.\n\n\nResults\nNurse uptake of PALSA PLUS training, with regard not only to ART specific components but also lung health, was high.\n\n The ongoing on-site training of all PHC nurses, as opposed to the once-off centralized training provided for ART nurses only at non-intervention clinics, enhanced nurses' experience of support for their work by allowing, not only for ongoing experiential learning, supervision and emotional support, but also for the ongoing managerial review of all those infrastructural and system-level changes required to facilitate health provider behaviour change and guideline implementation.\n\n The training of all PHC nurses in PALSA PLUS guideline use, as opposed to ART nurses only, was also perceived to better facilitate the integration of AIDS care within the clinic context.\n\n\nConclusion\nPALSA PLUS training successfully engaged all PHC nurses in a comprehensive approach to a range of illnesses affecting both HIV positive and negative patients.\n\n PHC nurse-training for integrated systems-based interventions should be prioritized on the ART funding agenda.\n\n Training for individual provider behaviour change is nonetheless only one aspect of the ongoing system-wide interventions required to effect lasting improvements in patient care in the context of an over-burdened and under-resourced PHC system.\n\n\n","id":"PMC2613903","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"BioMed

Prevention among Female Sex Workers in Generalized and Concentrated Epidemics","abstract":"Introduction\nSex workers have endured a high burden of HIV infection in and across HIV epidemics.\n\n A comprehensive, community empowerment-based HIV prevention intervention emphasizes sex worker organization and mobilization to address HIV risk and often includes community-led peer education, condom distribution, and other activities.\n\n Meta-analysis of such interventions suggests a potential 51% reduction in inconsistent condom use.\n\n Mathematical modeling exercises provide theoretical insight into potential impacts of the intervention on HIV incidence and burden in settings where interventions have not yet been implemented.\n\n\nMethods\nWe used a deterministic model, Goals, to project the impact on HIV infections when the community empowerment interventions were scaled up among female sex workers in Kenya, Thailand, Brazil, and Ukraine.\n\n Modeling scenarios included expansion of the comprehensive community empowerment-based HIV prevention intervention from baseline coverage over a 5-year period (565% in Kenya and Ukraine; 1070% in Thailand and Brazil), while other interventions were held at baseline levels.\n\n A second exercise increased the intervention coverage simultaneously with equitable access to ART for sex workers.\n\n Impacts on HIV outcomes among sex workers and adults are observed from 20122016 and, compared to status quo when all interventions are held constant.\n\n\nResults\nOptimistic but feasible coverage (65%70%) of the intervention demonstrated a range of impacts on HIV: 220 infections averted over 5 yrs.\n\n among sex workers in Thailand, 1,830 in Brazil, 2,220 in Ukraine, and 10,800 infections in Kenya.\n\n Impacts of the intervention for female sex workers extend to the adult population, cumulatively averting 730 infections in Thailand to 20,700 adult infections in Kenya.\n\n Impacts vary by country, influenced by HIV prevalence in risk groups, risk behaviors, intervention use, and population size.\n\n\nDiscussion\nA community empowerment approach to HIV prevention and access to universal ART for female sex workers is a promising human rights-based solution to overcoming the persistent burden of HIV among female sex workers across epidemic settings.\n\n\n","id":"PMC3916392","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Public Library of Science","authors":[{"firstname":"Andrea

HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) across the globe.\n Methods: Evaluation studies were retrieved and reviewed regarding study location, characteristics of participants, study design, intervention strategies, outcome indicators, and intervention findings.\n Results: The 28 studies spanned a broad range of intervention strategies, including coping skills, treatment and cure, cultural activities, community involvement, knowledge education, voluntary counseling and testing, peer-group support, three-layered service provision, child-directed group intervention, adult mentoring, and support group interventions.\n Regardless of study designs, all studies reported positive intervention effects, ranging from a reduction in HIV/AIDS stigma, loneliness, marginalization, distress, depression, anger, and anxiety to an increase in self-esteem, self-efficacy, coping skills, and quality of life.\n Conclusion: Although the existing studies have limitation with regard to program coverage, intensity, scope, and methodological challenges, they underscore the importance of developing community-based interventions to promote psychosocial well-being among PLWHA.\n Future studies need to employ more rigorous methodology and integrate contextual and institutional factors when implementing effective interventions.\n","id":"PMC4164241","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Routledge","authors":[{"firstname":"Liyun","surname":"Wu","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Xiaoming","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"10.1080/09540120902889926","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Economic

interventions are efficacious for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) detection, prevention, and care, but they are not broadly diffused.\n Understanding intervention adaptation and translation processes can support evidence-based intervention (EBI) diffusion processes.\n This paper provides a narrative review of a series of EBI for families affected by HIV (FAH) that were adapted across five randomized controlled trials in the US, Thailand, and South Africa over 15 years.\n The FAH interventions targeted parents living with HIV and their children or caregiver supports.\n Parents with HIV were primarily mothers infected through sexual transmission.\n The EBIs for FAH are reviewed with attention to commonalities and variations in risk environments and intervention features.\n Frameworks for common and robust intervention functions, principles, practice elements, and delivery processes are utilized to highlight commonalities and adaptations for each location, time period, and intervention delivery settings.\n Health care, housing, food, and financial security vary dramatically in each risk environment.\n Yet, all FAH face common health, mental health, transmission, and relationship challenges.\n The EBIs efficaciously addressed these common challenges and were adapted across contexts with fidelity to robust intervention principles, processes, factors, and practices.\n Intervention adaptation teams have a series of structural decision points: mainstreaming HIV with other local health priorities or not; selecting an optimal delivery site (clinics, homes, community centers); and how to translate intervention protocols to local contexts and cultures.\n Replication of interventions with fidelity must occur at the level of standardized functions and robust principles, processes, and practices, not manualized protocols.\n Adopting a continuous quality improvement paradigm will enhance rapid and global diffusion of EBI for FAH.\n","id":"PMC3120968","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Springer-Verlag","authors":[{"firstname":"Mary

is problematic in behavioral intervention trials.\n\n Postrandomization sources of bias are somewhat better known within the clinical epidemiological and trials literatures.\n\n Neglect of attention to possible research participation effects means that unintended participant behavior change stemming from artifacts of the research process has unknown potential to bias estimates of behavioral

for further analysis and they used a variety of HRQoL instruments: Medical Outcomes Study Short Form-36 or variants, Medical Outcomes Study-HIV, HIV Cost and Services Utilization Study measure, Multidimensional Quality of Life Questionnaire, HIV targeted quality of life instrument, Functional Assessment of Human Immunodeficiency Virus Infection, HIV Overview of Problems Evaluation System, EuroQol, Fanning Quality of Life scale, Health Index and PROQOL-HIV.\n\n In this review, the discussed determinants were thematically divided into socio-demographic, clinical, psychological and behavioural factors.\n\n Employment, immunological status, presence of symptoms, depression, social support and adherence to antiretroviral therapy were most frequently and consistently reported to be associated with HRQoL among people living with HIV.\n\n\nConclusions\nHRQoL among people living with HIV is influenced by several determinants.\n\n These determinants independently, but simultaneously impact perceived HRQoL.\n\n Most HRQoL instruments do not capture all key determinants.\n\n We recommend that the choice for an instrument should depend on the purpose of the HRQoL assessment.\n\n\nElectronic supplementary material\nThe online version of this article (doi:10.1186/2049-3258-72-40) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized

longitudinal observational study","abstract":"Background\nWhile studies have suggested that depression and HIV-related stigma may impede access to care, a growing body of literature also suggests that access to HIV care itself may help to decrease internalized HIV-related stigma and symptoms of depression in the general population of persons living with HIV.\n\n However, this has not been investigated in postpartum women living with HIV.\n\n Furthermore, linkage to care itself may have additional impacts on postpartum depression beyond the effects of antiretroviral therapy.\n\n We examined associations between linkage to HIV care, postpartum depression, and internalized stigma in a population with a high risk of depression: newly diagnosed HIV-positive pregnant women.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this prospective observational study, data were obtained from 135 HIV-positive women from eight antenatal clinics in the rural Nyanza Province of Kenya at their first antenatal visit (prior to testing HIV-positive for the first time) and subsequently at 6 weeks after giving birth.\n\n\nResults\nAt 6 weeks postpartum, women who had not linked to HIV care after testing positive at their first antenatal visit had higher levels of depression and internalized stigma, compared to women who had linked to care.\n\n Internalized stigma mediated the effect of linkage to care on depression.\n\n Furthermore, participants who had both linked to HIV care and initiated antiretroviral therapy reported the lowest levels of depressive symptoms.\n\n\nConclusions\nThese results provide further support for current efforts to ensure that women who are newly diagnosed with HIV during pregnancy become linked to HIV care as early as possible, with important benefits for both physical and mental health.\n\n\n","id":"PMC4261547","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"BioMed

The audit was conducted in two stages.\n Stage one describes the clinical and socio-demographic characteristics of 225 pregnant women referred to the team after screening positive for a significant

with the intent to kill themselves to the maternity staff when they first booked in for antenatal care.\n Previous PPD accounted for the largest majority of referrals (32 %) to the PMHT followed by depression (27 %) and self-harm (10 %).\n The majority of women (85 %) referred to the PMHT were engaged.\n Eight percent were so unwell at the point of referral they required an admission to the hospital.\n Attempted suicide in the subgroup of 73 women with previous PPD ranged from 2449 %.\n The findings from this audit suggest that self-harm in PPD warrants further

health-related drugs and services.\n\n We estimated the financial burden of health care for households with HIV-infected adults taking antiretroviral therapy (ART) in Côte d'Ivoire.\n\n\nMethodology/Principal Findings\nWe conducted a cross-sectional survey.\n\n After obtaining informed consent, we interviewed HIV-infected adults taking ART who had consecutively attended one of 18 HIV care facilities in Abidjan.\n\n We collected information on socioeconomic and medical characteristics.\n\n The main economic indicators were household capacity-to-pay (overall expenses minus food expenses), and health care expenditures.\n\n The primary outcome was the percentage of households confronted with catastrophic health expenditures (health expenditures were defined as catastrophic if they were greater than or equal to 40% of the capacity-to-pay).\n\n We recruited 1,190 adults.\n\n Median CD4 count was 187/mm3, median time on ART was 14 months, and 72% of subjects were women.\n\n Mean household capacity-to-pay was $213.7/month, mean health expenditures were $24.3/month, and 12.3% of households faced catastrophic health expenditures.\n\n Of the health expenditures, 75.3% were for the study subject (ARV drugs and CD4 tests, 24.6%; morbidity events diagnosis and treatment, 50.1%; transportation to HIV care centres, 25.3%) and 24.7% were for other household members.\n\n When we stratified by most recent CD4 count, morbidity events related expenses were significantly lower when subjects had higher CD4 counts.\n\n\nConclusions/Significance\nMany households in Côte d'Ivoire face catastrophic health expenditures that are not attributable to ARV drugs or routine follow-up tests.\n\n Innovative schemes should be developed to help HIV-infected patients on ART face the cost of morbidity events.\n\n\n","id":"PMC2887850","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Public Library of

Antiretroviral Therapy (ART) for HIV-Infected Pregnant and Postpartum Women","abstract":"Background\nDespite global progress in the fight to reduce maternal mortality, HIV-related maternal deaths remain persistently high, particularly in much of Africa.\n\n Lifelong antiretroviral therapy (ART) appears to be the most effective way to prevent these deaths, but the rates of three key outcomesART initiation, retention in care, and long-term ART adherenceremain low.\n\n This systematic review synthesized evidence on health systems factors affecting these outcomes in pregnant and postpartum women living with HIV.\n\n\nMethods\nSearches were conducted for studies addressing the population of interest (HIV-infected pregnant and postpartum women), the intervention of interest (ART), and the outcomes of interest (initiation, adherence, and retention).\n\n Quantitative and qualitative studies published in English since January 2008 were included.\n\n A four-stage narrative synthesis design was used to analyze findings.\n\n Review findings from 42 included studies were categorized according to five themes: 1) models of care, 2) service delivery, 3) resource constraints and governance challenges, 4) patient-health system engagement, and 5) maternal ART interventions.\n\n\nResults\nLow prioritization of maternal ART and persistent dropout along the maternal ART cascade were key findings.\n\n Service delivery barriers included poor communication and coordination among health system actors, poor clinical practices, and gaps in provider training.\n\n The few studies that assessed maternal ART interventions demonstrated the importance of multi-pronged, multi-leveled interventions.\n\n\nConclusions\nThere has been a lack of emphasis on the experiences, needs and vulnerabilities particular to HIV-infected pregnant and postpartum women.\n\n Supporting these women to successfully traverse the maternal ART cascade requires carefully designed and targeted interventions throughout the steps.\n\n Careful design of integrated service delivery models is of critical importance in this effort.\n\n Key knowledge gaps and research priorities were also identified, including definitions and indicators of adherence rates, and the importance of cumulative measures of dropout along the maternal ART cascade.\n\n\n","id":"PMC4193745","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Public Library of Science","authors":[{"firstname":"Christopher

physical, psychological, social and environmental domains was 42.5%, 40%, 51.2% and 34% respectively.\n\n PLHA who had severe personalized stigma and negative self-image had 3.4 (1.6-7.0) and 2.1 (1.0-4.1) times higher risk of severe depression respectively (p?&lt;?.\n\n001).\n\n PLHA who had severe depression had experienced 2.7(1.1-7.7) times significantly poorer QOL.\n\n\nConclusions\nSevere forms of stigma were equivalently prevalent among all the categories of PLHA.\n\n However, PLHA who had experienced severe depression had only developed poor QOL.\n\n A high level of social support was associated with a high level of QOL.\n\n\n","id":"PMC3444349","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"BioMed

and HIV in Botswana: A Population-Based Study on Gender-Specific Socioeconomic and Behavioral Correlates","abstract":"Background\nDepression is a leading contributor to the burden of disease worldwide, a critical barrier to HIV prevention and a common serious HIV co-morbidity.\n\n However, depression screening and treatment are limited in sub-Saharan Africa, and there are few population-level studies examining the prevalence and gender-specific factors associated with depression.\n\n\nMethods\nWe conducted a cross-sectional population-based study of 1849 year-old adults from five districts in Botswana with the highest prevalence of HIV-infection.\n\n We examined the prevalence of depressive symptoms, using a Hopkins Symptom Checklist for Depression (HSCL-D) score of ?1.75 to define depression, and correlates of depression using multivariate logistic regression stratified by sex.\n\n\nResults\nOf 1,268 participants surveyed, 25.3% of women and 31.4% of men had depression.\n\n Among women, lower education (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 2.07, 95% confidence interval [1.303.32]), higher income (1.77 [1.092.86]), and lack of control in sexual decision-making (2.35 [1.463.81]) were positively associated with depression.\n\n Among men, being single (1.95 [1.023.74]), living in a rural area (1.63 [1.022.65]), having frequent visits to a health provider (3.29 [1.885.74]), anticipated HIV stigma (fearing discrimination if HIV status was revealed) (2.04 [1.273.29]), and intergenerational sex (2.28 [1.174.41]) were independently associated with depression.\n\n\nDiscussion\nDepression is highly prevalent in Botswana, and its correlates are gender-specific.\n\n Our findings suggest multiple targets for screening and prevention of depression and highlight the need to integrate mental health counseling and treatment into primary health care to decrease morbidity and improve HIV management efforts.\n\n\n","id":"PMC2999532","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Public Library of

research","abstract":"Introduction\nWhile biomedical HIV prevention offers promise for preventing new HIV infections, access to and uptake of these technologies remain unacceptably low in some settings.\n\n New models for delivery of HIV prevention are clearly needed.\n\n This commentary highlights the potential of person?centred programming and research for increasing the cultural relevance, applicability and use of efficacious HIV prevention strategies.\n\n It calls for a shift in perspective within HIV prevention programmes and research, whereby people are recognized for their agency rather than assumed to be passive beneficiaries or research participants.\n\n\nDiscussion\nPerson?centred HIV prevention reorientates power dynamics so that individuals (rather than interventions) are at the centre of the response.\n\n Respecting personal choice and agency  and understanding how these are shaped by the context in which people exercise these choices  are critical dimensions of the person?centred approach.\n\n Community?based participatory research should be employed to inform and evaluate person?centred HIV prevention.\n\n We argue that community?based participatory research is an orientation rather than a method, meaning that it can be integrated within a range of research methods including randomized controlled trials.\n\n But embracing community?based participatory approaches in HIV prevention research requires a systemic shift in how this type of research is reported in high impact journals and in how research impact is conceived.\n\n Community?based organizations have a critical role to play in both person?centred HIV prevention and research.\n\n\nConclusions\n\nHIV prevention is situated at the intersection of unprecedented opportunity and crisis.\n\n Person?centred approaches to HIV prevention and research shift power dynamics, and have the potential to ensure a more sustainable response with each individual actively participating in their own care and meaningfully contributing to the production of knowledge on HIV prevention.\n\n This approach taps into the resourcefulness, resilience and knowledge of the person and their communities, to strengthen research and programmes, making them more relevant, appropriate and effective.\n\n\n","id":"PMC6193315","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"John Wiley and Sons

Cross-sectional interview data were collected from 1,076 non-HIV patients in multiple healthcare settings in Mumbai and Bengaluru, India.\n The vast majority of participants supported mandatory testing for marginalized groups and coercive family policies for PLHA, stating that they deserved their infections and didnt care about infecting others.\n Most participants did not want to be treated at the same clinic or use the same utensils as PLHA and transmission misconceptions were common.\n Multiple linear regression showed that blame, transmission misconceptions, symbolic stigma and negative feelings toward PLHA were significantly associated with both stigma and discrimination.\n The results indicate an urgent need for continued stigma reduction efforts to reduce the suffering of PLHA and barriers to prevention and treatment.\n Given the high levels of blame and endorsement of coercive policies, it is crucial that such programs are shaped within a human rights framework.\n","id":"PMC3313036","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Springer US","authors":[{"firstname":"Maria

illicit drug histories: A study of Thai nurses' attitudes","abstract":"Background\nStigma is a key barrier for the delivery of care to patients living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA).\n\n In the Asia region, the HIV/AIDS epidemic has disproportionately affected socially marginalised groups, in particular, injecting drug users.\n\n The effect of the stigmatising attitudes towards injecting drug users on perceptions of PLWHA within the health care contexts has not been thoroughly explored, and typically neglected in terms of stigma intervention.\n\n\nMethods\nSemi-structured interviews were conducted with a group of twenty Thai trainee and qualified nurses.\n\n Drawing upon the idea of 'social reciprocity', this paper examines the constructions of injecting drug users and PLWHA by a group of Thai nurses.\n\n Narratives were explored with a focus on how participants' views concerning the high-risk behaviour of injecting drug use might influence their attitudes towards PLWHA.\n\n\nResults\nThe analysis shows that active efforts were made by participants to separate their views of patients living with HIV/AIDS from injecting drug users.\n\n While the former were depicted as patients worthy of social support and inclusion, the latter were excluded on the basis that they were perceived as irresponsible 'social cheaters' who pose severe social and economic harm to the community.\n\n Absent in the narratives were references to wider socio-political and epidemiological factors related to drug use and needle sharing that expose injecting drug users to risk; these behaviours were constructed as individual choices, allowing HIV positive drug users to be blamed for their seropositive status.\n\n These attitudes could potentially have indirect negative implications on the nurses' opinions of patients living with HIV/AIDS more generally.\n\n\nConclusion\nDecreasing the stigma associated with illicit drugs might play crucial role in improving attitudes towards patients living

commercial sex and commercial blood donation  a factorial survey of medical students in China","abstract":"Background\nHIV/AIDS related stigma interferes with the provision of appropriate care and support for people living with HIV/AIDS.\n\n Currently, programs to address the stigma approach it as if it occurs in isolation, separate from the co-stigmas related to the various modes of disease transmission including injection drug use (IDU) and commercial sex (CS).\n\n In order to develop better programs to address HIV/AIDS related stigma, the inter-relationship (or 'layering') between HIV/AIDS stigma and the co-stigmas needs to be better understood.\n\n This paper describes an experimental study for disentangling the layering of HIV/AIDS related stigmas.\n\n\nMethods\nThe study used a factorial survey design.\n\n 352 medical students from Guangzhou were presented with four random vignettes each describing a hypothetical male.\n\n The vignettes were identical except for the presence of a disease diagnosis (AIDS, leukaemia, or no disease) and a co-characteristic (IDU, CS, commercial blood donation (CBD), blood transfusion or no co-characteristic).\n\n After reading each vignette, participants completed a measure of social distance that assessed the level of stigmatising attitudes.\n\n\nResults\nBivariate and multivariable analyses revealed statistically significant levels of stigma associated with AIDS, IDU, CS and CBD.\n\n The layering of stigma was explored using a recently developed technique.\n\n Strong interactions between the stigmas of AIDS and the co-characteristics were also found.\n\n AIDS was significantly less stigmatising than IDU or CS.\n\n Critically, the stigma of AIDS in combination with either the stigmas of IDU or CS was significantly less than the stigma of IDU alone or CS alone.\n\n\nConclusion\nThe findings pose several surprising challenges to conventional beliefs about HIV/AIDS related stigma and stigma interventions that have focused exclusively on the disease stigma.\n\n Contrary to the belief that having a co-stigma would add to the intensity of stigma attached to people with HIV/AIDS, the findings indicate the presence of an illness might have a moderating effect on the stigma of certain co-characteristics like IDU.\n\n The strong interdependence between the stigmas of HIV/AIDS and the co-stigmas of IDU and CS suggest that reducing the co-stigmas should be an integral part of HIV/AIDS stigma intervention within this context.\n\n\n","id":"PMC2180176","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"BioMed Central","authors":[{"firstname":"Kit

lack of knowledge on HIV and counselling skills; or high workloads and lack of staff; unavailability of HIV testing at commune level; shortage of antiretroviral drugs; and lack of operational guidelines.\n\n A negative attitude during counselling and provision of care, treating in a separate area and avoidance of providing service at all were seen by health workers as the result of fear of being infected, as well as distrust towards almost all HIV-infected patients because of the prevailing association with antisocial behaviours.\n\n Additionally, the fragmentation of the health care system into specialized vertical pillars, including a vertical programme for HIV/AIDS, is a major obstacle to providing a continuum of care.\n\n\nConclusion\nMany hospital staff were not being able to provide good care or were even unwilling to provide appropriate care for HIV-positive pregnant women The study suggests that the quality of prevention of mother-to-child transmission service could be enhanced by improving communication and other skills of health workers, providing them with greater support and enhancing their motivation.\n\n Reduction of workload would also be important.\n\n Development of a practical strategy is needed to strengthen and adapt the referral system to meet the needs of patients.\n\n\n","id":"PMC2684067","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"BioMed Central","authors":[{"firstname":"Thu Anh","surname":"Nguyen","email":"anhstat@yahoo.com","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Pauline","surname":"Oosterhoff","email":"pauline_oosterhoff@yahoo.com","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yen Ngoc","surname":"Pham","email":"yenphamngoc@gmail.com","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Anita","surname":"Hardon","email":"ahardon@xs4all.nl","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Pamela","surname":"Wright","email":"pamela.wright@mcnv.nl","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1080/09540120500356906","date":"1970-01-01","title":"HIV-disclosure in the context of vertical transmission: HIV-positive mothers in Johannesburg, South Africa","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1016/j.pec.2004.11.014","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Social consequences of HIV-positive women's participation in prevention of mother-to-child transmission programmes","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1016/S0149-7189(02)00046-0","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Stigma, HIV/AIDS and prevention of mother-to-child transmission in Zambia","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1080/09540120600971224","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Disclosure of HIV among black African men and women attending a London HIV clinic","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1080/0954012031000068353","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Disclosure of HIV infection in south India: patterns, reasons and reactions","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1089/apc.2005.19.526","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Barriers and facilitators to antiretroviral medication adherence among patients with HIV in Chennai, India: a qualitative study","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1016/j.socscimed.2008.05.032","date":"1970-01-01","title":"HIV-related stigma: adapting a theoretical framework for use in India","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Bharat S, Aggleton P, Tyrer P.
