Repurposing existing pharmaceuticals provides an immediate treatment opportunity. We assessed the efficacy of sofosbuvir and daclatasvir with ribavirin for treating patients with COVID-19.\nMethods\nThis was a single-centre, randomized controlled trial in adults with moderate COVID-19 admitted to the Ghaem Shahr Razi Hospital in Mazandaran Province, Iran. Patients were randomly assigned to 400 mg sofosbuvir, 60 mg daclatasvir and 1200 mg ribavirin (intervention group) or to standard care (control group). The primary endpoint of this study was length of hospital stay. This study is registered by IRCT.ir under the ID: IRCT20200328046886N1.\nResults\nBetween 20 March 2020 and 8 April 2020, 48 patients were recruited; 24 patients were randomly assigned to the intervention group and 24 to the control group. The median duration of hospital stay was 6 days in both groups (P = 0.398). The number of ICU admissions in the sofosbuvir/daclatasvir/ribavirin group was not significantly lower than the control group (0 versus 4, P = 0.109). There was no difference in the number of deaths between the groups (0 versus 3, P = 0.234). The cumulative incidence of recovery was higher in the sofosbuvir/daclatasvir/ribavirin arm (Gray's P = 0.033).\nConclusions\nThis randomized trial was too small to make definitive conclusions. There were trends in favour of the sofosbuvir/daclatasvir/ribavirin arm for recovery and lower death rates. However, there was an imbalance in the baseline characteristics between the arms. Larger randomized trials should be conducted to investigate this treatment further.\nIntroduction\nThe novel coronavirus (COVID-19) epidemic, which began in early December 2019 in Wuhan, China, has spread to most countries in the world and has led to a catastrophic burden on healthcare systems. The first confirmed case of the disease in Iran was reported from Qom city on 19 February 2020 and the disease has now been confirmed in all provinces of the country. According to the WHO, confirmed cases to date (29 May 2020) exceeded 146 000 in Iran, with more than 7600 deaths. Unfortunately, therapeutic options thought to be effective have been proven otherwise one by one. New options are needed urgently, but require time to develop. Repurposing existing pharmaceuticals provides an immediate treatment opportunity. Current trials include remdesivir, hydroxychloroquine, chloroquine, favipiravir, lopinavir/ritonavir and nitazoxanide; however, with the possible exception of remdesivir, these drugs have not shown efficacy in treating patients with COVID-19.\nThe once-daily combination of sofosbuvir and daclatasvir has demonstrated success as treatment for HCV. The combination has since been added to the Essential Medicines List in 2015 and has been made accessible worldwide in generic formulations. A generic fixed dose combination of sofosbuvir and daclatasvir (400/60 mg, respectively) is used to treat HCV in Iran and therefore is a pragmatic candidate for trial against COVID-19.\nSofosbuvir has a broad antiviral spectrum including other members of the Flaviviridae and Togaviridae families including yellow fever, Zika, dengue and chikungunya viruses.COVID-19 is caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), a positive-sense RNA virus. SARS-CoV-2 shares a similar replication mechanism with other RNA viruses, requiring enzymes including RNA-dependent polymerase (RdRp), main protease (Mpro), helicase and other non-structural proteins, which therefore act as attractive targets to model antiviral drugs against.In silico studies have predicted that sofosbuvir, daclatasvir and ribavirin may bind with high energy to the SARS-CoV-2 RdRp enzyme and Mpro and inhibit their function. Some in vitro studies did not find sofosbuvir or ribavirin to be effective at reducing SARS-CoV-2-induced cellular death at feasible concentrations. However, in a more recent in vitro study, the effects of sofosbuvir, daclatasvir and ribavirin in inhibiting replication of infectious SARS-CoV-2 virus particles were studied in three different cell lines. Daclatasvir was consistently able to inhibit the virus in all tested cell lines whilst sofosbuvir and ribavirin were less effective and only worked in certain cell lines.\nSofosbuvir and daclatasvir have demonstrated good safety profiles with minimal drug interactions and may be an affordable and widely available treatment option for COVID-19. We therefore conducted a randomized controlled trial in adult patients hospitalized with COVID-19 in Ghaem Shahr Razi Hospital to evaluate the efficacy and safety of sofosbuvir and daclatasvir in combination with ribavirin compared with standard care.\nMethods\nStudy design and participants\nThis study was a single-centre, randomized clinical trial to evaluate the effectiveness of sofosbuvir/daclatasvir with ribavirin against controls who received standard of care for COVID-19 at the time of the study. The study population were patients suspected of having COVID-19 who were referred to Ghaem Shahr Razi Hospital in Mazandaran Province between 20 March 2020 and 8 April 2020. Patients with initial symptoms of fever (oral temperature &gt;=37.8 C at least once before enrolment) and/or cough, shortness of breath and gastrointestinal symptoms were considered to be suspected of having COVID-19. To confirm COVID-19 infection, a positive qualitative RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 and/or features consistent with COVID-19 on a chest CT scan was required. Cases of confirmed COVID-19 in the age group of 18-80 years were included. Only patients with moderate disease on admission were included, which was defined as respiratory rate of &lt;24/min, arterial O2 saturation of &gt;94% and symptom onset &lt;=8 days prior to admission, together with compatible findings in a chest CT scan.\nPatients with multiorgan failure, active cancer, renal insufficiency (creatine clearance less than 50 mL/min/1.73 m2), anaemia (haemoglobin less than 9 g/dL), pregnant women or men with a pregnant wife, and patients treated with amiodarone, phenytoin, phenobarbital, rifabutin or carbamazepine were excluded. All patients were required to provide written informed consent prior to participation in the study.\nRandomization and masking\nOnce patients fulfilled inclusion and exclusion criteria and signed the consent form, they were randomly assigned to each treatment arm in a 1:1 ratio by block randomization and a block size of 4. Sealed envelope online software was used to randomize patients to the intervention and control groups. The study was open label and patients and managing physicians were not blind to patient allocation.\nProcedures\nAfter randomization, the intervention group received the combined single-pill once-daily regimen of sofosbuvir/daclatasvir at a dose of 400/60 mg (Sovodak, Fanavaran Rojan Mohaghegh Daru Co, Tehran, Iran) and ribavirin 600 mg twice daily. The control group received hydroxychloroquine (400 mg single dose) and lopinavir/ritonavir (400/100 mg twice daily), with or without ribavirin (600 mg twice daily), according to the national recommendation at the time of the study.\nClinical and laboratory monitoring\nDemographic, clinical, radiological and laboratory data of patients were collected at baseline.\nOutcomes\nThe primary outcome of the study was length of hospital stay. Secondary outcomes included the frequency of ICU admission, invasive mechanical ventilation, duration of ICU admission, mechanical ventilation and, finally, the frequency and time to recovery, defined as hospital discharge alive.\nStatistical analysis\nReducing the length of hospital stay by 4 days was considered to be the desired outcome of this study. At 90% power and a 4 day difference in hospitalization length between the two groups, the calculated sample size equalled 24 in each group (corrected for 10% attrition rate). The outcomes of this study were analysed in the ITT population of randomized patients.\nComparison between the two groups was performed by a Mann-Whitney U-test for continuous outcomes and Fisher's exact test for categorical outcomes. Time to recovery was compared by graphically plotting the cause-specific cumulative incidence functions (CIFs) by treatment group; difference between groups was evaluated by Gray's test for the equality of CIFs. Adjustment for baseline characteristics was carried out using Cox Proportional Hazards and competing risks regression models [see Table S1 (available as Supplementary data at JAC Online)]. A P value was considered statistically significant at the P &lt; 0.05 threshold. Statistical analysis was performed using STATA (version 16.0; StataCorp) and R software (version 3.6.3; R Foundation).\nEthics approval\nThe study protocol was approved by the institutional review board and ethics committee of Mazandaran University of Medical Sciences (approval number: IR.MAZUMS.REC.1399.019). This study is registered by IRCT.ir (ID: IRCT20200328046886N1), accessible at https://www.irct.ir/trial/46885.\nResults\nBetween 20 March 2020 and 8 April 2020, 195 patients were screened and 48 patients met the enrolment criteria and were recruited and randomized to the intervention arm (n = 24) or the control arm (n = 24, Figure 1). The median age (years) of participants in the sofosbuvir/daclatasvir group was 45 (IQR 38-69) and in the control group was 60 (IQR 48-69). A total of 18 patients were men (38%) versus 30 (63%) women (Table 1). Overall, 30 patients (63%) had existing comorbidities, which were most commonly diabetes and hypertension. The median time to admission from symptom onset was 5 days for both groups (IQR 4-5). The age, sex and baseline characteristics were generally similar between the two groups (Table 1); however, the control arm was on average 15 years older (P = 0.158) and had higher rates of diabetes (P = 0.006) and slightly higher rates of hypertension (P = 0.547). Two of the control subjects received hydroxychloroquine alone; the others received lopinavir/ritonavir either alone or in combination with hydroxychloroquine and, in one case, ribavirin. \nTrial profile. \nBaseline characteristics of patients\n	SOF/DCV/RBV (n = 24)	Control (n = 24)	P value	 	Male, n (%)	11 (46)	7 (29)	0.371	 	Age (years), median (IQR)	45 (38-69)	60 (47.5-68.5)	0.158	 	Time from symptom onset (days), median (IQR)	5 (3-5)	5 (4-7)	0.457	 	Respiratory rate (/min), median (IQR)	20 (18-22)	20 (18-22)	0.925	 	Temperature ( C), median (IQR)	37.0 (36.6-37.5)	37.5 (36.9-37.8)	0.139	 	Comorbidities, n (%)	 	 any	13 (54)	17 (71)	0.371	 	 diabetes	4 (17)	14 (58)	0.006	 	 hypertension	7 (29)	10 (42)	0.547	 	 ischaemic heart disease	4 (17)	7 (29)	0.494	 	 COPD	1 (4)	0 (0)	1.000	 	Laboratory findings on admission, median (IQR)	 	 arterial O2 saturation (%)	95 (95-95)	95 (95-96)	0.269	 	 haemoglobin (g/dL)	12 (11-13)	12 (11-13)	0.765	 	 WBCs (x109/L)	6.4 (5.2-7.7)	6.2 (5.9-9.2)	0.602	 	 AST (U/L)	26 (16-36)	26 (19-35)	0.898	 	 ALT (U/L)	21 (15-39)	24 (15-35)	0.840	 	 creatinine (mg/dL)	0.9 (0.8-0.9)	0.9 (0.8-1.1)	0.522	 	 ESR (mm/h)	47 (27-67)	61 (37-120)	0.099	 	 BUN (mg/dL)	29 (20-37)	26 (19-35)	0.339	 	 INR	1.3 (1.2-1.4)	1.3 (1.2-1.6)	0.567	 	\nSOF/DCV/RBV, sofosbuvir/daclatasvir/ribavirin; ESR, Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate; BUN, Blood Urea Nitrogen; INR, International Normalized Ratio.\nPercentages are calculated from non-missing values.\n\nP values are calculated using Fisher's exact test for categorical outcomes and Mann-Whitney U-test for continuous outcomes.\nThe median length of hospitalization in the intervention group and control group was the same (6 days). No patients in the intervention group were admitted to ICU or required invasive mechanical ventilation compared with four individuals in the control group. No patients in the intervention group died compared with three in the control group; however, these differences were not significant (Table 2). The CIF for recovery by treatment arm is shown in Figure 2. Median time to recovery was 6 days in both groups; however, the difference between the groups was significant (Gray's test P = 0.033). After adjustment for potential baseline confounders, the association between treatment group and time to recovery was not significant (Table S1). \nCumulative incidence of recovery by treatment arm.

Sofosbuvir/daclatasvir/ribavirin did not reduce the duration of hospitalization, but cumulative incidence of recovery was higher in the sofosbuvir/daclatasvir/ribavirin group compared with the control group. Fewer ICU admissions and deaths were observed in the sofosbuvir/daclatasvir/ribavirin arm; however, these differences were not significant.\nTo our knowledge, this is the first clinical trial of sofosbuvir/daclatasvir/ribavirin in COVID-19 patients; however, there are limitations to our study. The median age was higher in the control arm and there were more patients with diabetes in the control arm. In a sensitivity analysis, we adjusted our results for observed baseline imbalance; however, the interpretation of these models is limited due to the small sample size and possible error margin. Most importantly, the number of patients was not high enough to identify probable beneficial effects on survival. A larger study would be required in order to prove such an effect. We also excluded elderly subjects, who have higher mortality and might have benefited more from sofosbuvir/daclatasvir/ribavirin. It would be interesting to see the effects of sofosbuvir/daclatasvir plus/minus ribavirin in more advanced cases and in elderly patients.\nAnother limitation of our study is lack of blinding. Unfortunately, due to the urgent situation imposed by COVID-19, it was not possible to prepare a suitable placebo in time. Whilst we found clinical improvement benefits, we were not able to analyse biological markers of improvement as we did not measure viral decay nor serological inflammatory markers over time, which would both be helpful data to demonstrate effective antiviral therapy.\nIn this trial of 24 patients per arm, there was no statistically significant difference in length of hospital stay between the arms. However, the sample size could be too small to make reliable conclusions. We are also not able to clearly identify from this study whether the benefits found in terms of clinical improvement and cumulative incidence of recovery were directly from the effects of sofosbuvir or daclatasvir or ribavirin or due to a synergistic effect of the combination of all three antivirals. In vitro models have shown a synergistic effect when combining other antivirals against COVID-19. Another study in China has shown that the combination of ribavirin with lopinavir/ritonavir and interferon beta-1 together is superior to lopinavir/ritonavir alone in COVID-19.\nThere are seven more trials registered in https://www.irct.ir/ working on sofosbuvir-containing regimens in COVID-19 and various others studies around the world include ribavirin-containing regimens. We are aware that in at least five of these sofosbuvir-containing trials in Iran, data collection has finished. If the cumulative results of these trials indicate beneficial effect, it is well advised that a larger trial be performed on this subject. A large trial could identify the effects on mild, moderate and severe cases in elderly patients and the effects on survival and hospital stay.\nIf sofosbuvir/daclatasvir is proven to be effective against COVID-19, given that both are widely available in generic formulations, costing an estimated $5 per 14 day course or only $0.39 per day as a combination, sofosbuvir/daclatasvir may be an affordable and accessible treatment option for COVID-19. The promising results of this small sample warrant further trials into the effectiveness of sofosbuvir and daclatasvir for the treatment of COVID-19.\nFunding\nThis study was funded by Mazandaran University of Medical Sciences.\nTransparency declarations\nS.

Of six family members who travelled to Wuhan, five were identified as infected with the novel coronavirus.\n\n Additionally, one family member, who did not travel to Wuhan, became infected with the virus after several days of contact with four of the family members.\n\n None of the family members had contacts with Wuhan markets or animals, although two had visited a Wuhan hospital.\n\n Five family members (aged 36–66 years) presented with fever, upper or lower respiratory tract symptoms, or diarrhoea, or a combination of these 3–6 days after exposure.\n\n They presented to our hospital (The University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen) 6–10 days after symptom onset.\n\n They and one asymptomatic child (aged 10 years) had radiological ground-glass lung opacities.\n\n Older patients (aged &gt;60 years) had more systemic symptoms, extensive radiological ground-glass lung changes, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and increased C-reactive protein and lactate dehydrogenase levels.\n\n The nasopharyngeal or throat swabs of these six patients were negative for known respiratory microbes by point-of-care multiplex RT-PCR, but five patients (four adults and the child) were RT-PCR positive for genes encoding the internal RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and surface Spike protein of this novel coronavirus, which were confirmed by Sanger sequencing.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these five patients' RT-PCR amplicons and two full genomes by next-generation sequencing showed that this is a novel coronavirus, which is closest to the bat severe acute respiatory syndrome

January 2020. We analyzed data on the first 425 confirmed cases in Wuhan to determine the epidemiologic characteristics of NCIP.\n\n\nMethods\nWe collected information on demographic characteristics, exposure history, and illness timelines of laboratory-confirmed cases of NCIP that had been reported by January 22, 2020. We described characteristics of the cases and estimated the key epidemiologic time-delay distributions.\n\n In the early period of exponential growth, we estimated the epidemic doubling time and the basic reproductive number.\n\n\nResults\nAmong the first 425 patients with confirmed NCIP, the median age was 59 years and 56% were male.\n\n The majority of cases (55%) with onset before January 1, 2020, were linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, as compared with 8.6% of the subsequent cases.\n\n The mean incubation period was 5.2 days (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.1 to 7.0), with the 95th percentile of the distribution at 12.5 days.\n\n In its early stages, the epidemic doubled in size every 7.4 days.\n\n With a mean serial interval of 7.5 days (95% CI, 5.3 to 19), the basic reproductive number was estimated to be 2.2 (95% CI, 1.4 to 3.9).\n\n\nConclusions\nOn the basis of this information, there is evidence that human-to-human transmission has occurred among close contacts since the middle of December 2019.

outcomes in patients with a number of different malignancies.\n\n The objective of this study was to assess the relationship between NLR and mortality in a population of adult critically ill patients.\n\n\nMethods\nWe performed an observational cohort study of unselected intensive care unit (ICU) patients based on records in a large clinical database.\n\n We computed individual patient NLR and categorized patients by quartile of this ratio.\n\n The association of NLR quartiles and 28-day mortality was assessed using multivariable logistic regression.\n\n Secondary outcomes included mortality in the ICU, in-hospital mortality and 1-year mortality.\n\n An a priori subgroup analysis of patients with versus without sepsis was performed to assess any differences in the relationship between the NLR and outcomes in these cohorts.\n\n\nResults\nA total of 5,056 patients were included.\n\n Their 28-day mortality rate was 19%.\n\n The median age of the cohort was 65 years, and 47% were female.\n\n The median NLR for the entire cohort was 8.9 (interquartile range, 4.99 to 16.21).\n\n Following multivariable adjustments, there was a stepwise increase in mortality with increasing quartiles of NLR (first quartile: reference category; second quartile odds ratio (OR) = 1.32; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.03 to 1.71; third quartile OR = 1.43; 95% CI, 1.12 to 1.83; 4th quartile

risks of epidemics, accounting for social and non-pharmaceutical prevention interventions.\n\n\nMethods\nWe used data from Dec 31, 2019, to Jan 28, 2020, on the number of cases exported from Wuhan internationally (known days of symptom onset from Dec 25, 2019, to Jan 19, 2020) to infer the number of infections in Wuhan from Dec 1, 2019, to Jan 25, 2020. Cases exported domestically were then estimated.\n\n We forecasted the national and global spread of 2019-nCoV, accounting for the effect of the metropolitan-wide quarantine of Wuhan and surrounding cities, which began Jan 23–24, 2020. We used data on monthly flight bookings from the Official Aviation Guide and data on human mobility across more than 300 prefecture-level cities in mainland China from the Tencent database.\n\n Data on confirmed cases were obtained from the reports published by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\n Serial interval estimates were based on previous studies of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV).\n\n A susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered metapopulation model was used to simulate the epidemics across all major cities in China.\n\n The basic reproductive number was estimated using Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods and presented using the resulting posterior mean and 95% credibile interval (CrI).\n\n\nFindings\nIn our baseline scenario, we estimated that the basic reproductive number for 2019-nCoV was 2·68 (95% CrI 2·47–2·86) and that 75?815 individuals (95% CrI 37?304–130?330) have been infected in Wuhan as of Jan 25, 2020. The epidemic doubling time was 6·4 days (95% CrI 5·8–7·1).\n\n We estimated that in the baseline scenario, Chongqing, Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Shenzhen had imported 461 (95% CrI 227–805), 113 (57–193), 98 (49–168), 111 (56–191), and 80 (40–139) infections from Wuhan, respectively.\n\n If the transmissibility of 2019-nCoV were similar everywhere domestically and over time, we inferred that epidemics are already growing exponentially in multiple major cities of China with a lag time behind the Wuhan outbreak of about 1–2 weeks.\n\n\nInterpretation\nGiven that 2019-nCoV is no longer contained within Wuhan, other major Chinese cities are probably sustaining localised outbreaks.\n\n Large cities overseas with close transport links to China could also become outbreak epicentres, unless substantial public health interventions at both the population and personal levels are implemented immediately.\n\n Independent self-sustaining outbreaks in major cities globally could become inevitable because of substantial exportation of presymptomatic cases and in the absence of large-scale public health interventions.\n\n Preparedness plans and mitigation interventions should be readied for quick deployment globally.\n\n\nFunding\nHealth and Medical Research Fund (Hong Kong, China).\n\n\n","id":"PMC7159271","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Elsevier Ltd.","authors":[{"firstname":"Joseph T","surname":"Wu","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Kathy","surname":"Leung","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Gabriel M","surname":"Leung","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.3390/jcm9020419","date":"2020-02-03","title":"The Rate of Underascertainment of Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) Infection: Estimation Using Japanese Passengers Data on Evacuation Flights","abstract":"From 29 to 31 January 2020, a total of 565 Japanese citizens were evacuated from Wuhan, China on three chartered flights.\n All passengers were screened upon arrival in Japan for symptoms consistent with novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection and tested for presence of the virus.\n Assuming that the mean detection window of the virus can be informed by the mean serial interval (estimated at 7.5 days), the ascertainment rate of infection was estimated at 9.2% (95% confidence interval: 5.0, 20.0).\n This indicates that the incidence of infection in Wuhan can be estimated at 20,767 infected individuals, including those with asymptomatic and mildly symptomatic infections.\n The infection fatality risk (IFR)—the actual risk of death among all infected individuals—is therefore 0.3% to 0.6%, which may be comparable to Asian influenza pandemic of 1957–1958.","id":"PMC7074297","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"MDPI","authors":[{"firstname":"Hiroshi","surname":"Nishiura","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Tetsuro","surname":"Kobayashi","email":"NULL","contributions":"5"},{"firstname":"Tetsuro","surname":"Kobayashi","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yichi","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"4"},{"firstname":"Katsuma","surname":"Hayashi","email":"NULL","contributions":"4"},{"firstname":"Takeshi","surname":"Miyama","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Ryo","surname":"Kinoshita","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Natalie M.","surname":"Linton","email":"NULL","contributions":"4"},{"firstname":"Natalie M.","surname":"Linton","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Sung-mok","surname":"Jung","email":"NULL","contributions":"5"},{"firstname":"Sung-mok","surname":"Jung","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Baoyin","surname":"Yuan","email":"NULL","contributions":"5"},{"firstname":"Baoyin","surname":"Yuan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ayako","surname":"Suzuki","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Andrei R.","surname":"Akhmetzhanov","email":"NULL","contributions":"4"}]},{"doi":"10.1056/NEJMoa2001316","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Early Transmission Dynamics in Wuhan, China, of Novel Coronavirus–Infected Pneumonia","abstract":"Background\nThe initial cases of novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV)–infected pneumonia (NCIP) occurred in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, in December 2019 and January 2020.

(SARS-CoV-2) in a simulated Singaporean population.\n\n Using this model, we estimated the cumulative number of SARS-CoV-2 infections at 80 days, after detection of 100 cases of community transmission, under three infectivity scenarios (basic reproduction number [R0] of 1·5, 2·0, or 2·5) and assuming 7·5% of infections are asymptomatic.\n\n We first ran the model assuming no intervention was in place (baseline scenario), and then assessed the effect of four intervention scenarios compared with a baseline scenario on the size and progression of the outbreak for each R0 value.\n\n These scenarios included isolation measures for infected individuals and quarantining of family members (hereafter referred to as quarantine); quarantine plus school closure; quarantine plus workplace distancing; and quarantine, school closure, and workplace distancing (hereafter referred to as the combined intervention).\n\n We also did sensitivity analyses by altering the asymptomatic fraction of infections (22·7%, 30·0%, 40·0%, and 50·0%) to compare outbreak sizes under the same control measures.\n\n\nFindings\nFor the baseline scenario, when R0 was 1·5, the median cumulative number of infections at day 80 was 279?000 (IQR 245?000–320?000), corresponding to 7·4% (IQR 6·5–8·5) of the resident population of Singapore.\n\n The median number of infections increased with higher infectivity: 727?000 cases (670?000–776?000) when R0 was 2·0, corresponding to 19·3% (17·8–20·6) of the Singaporean population, and 1?207?000 cases (1?164?000–1?249?000) when R0 was 2·5, corresponding to 32% (30·9–33·1) of the Singaporean population.\n\n Compared with the baseline scenario, the combined intervention was the most effective, reducing the estimated median number of infections by 99·3% (IQR 92·6–99·9) when R0 was 1·5, by 93·0% (81·5–99·7) when R0 was 2·0, and by 78·2% (59·0 ?94·4) when R0 was 2·5. Assuming increasing asymptomatic fractions up to 50·0%, up to 277 000 infections were estimated to occur at day 80 with the combined intervention relative to 1800 for the baseline at R0 of 1·5.\nInterpretation\nImplementing the combined intervention of quarantining infected individuals and their family members, workplace distancing, and school closure once community transmission has been detected could substantially reduce the number of SARS-CoV-2 infections.\n\n We therefore recommend immediate deployment of this strategy if local secondary transmission is confirmed within Singapore.\n\n However, quarantine and workplace distancing should be prioritised over school closure because at this early stage, symptomatic children have higher withdrawal rates from school than do symptomatic adults from work.\n\n At higher asymptomatic proportions, intervention effectiveness might be substantially reduced requiring the need for effective case management and treatments, and preventive measures such as vaccines.\n\n\nFunding\nSingapore Ministry of Health, Singapore Population Health Improvement Centre.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7158571","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Elsevier Ltd.","authors":[{"firstname":"Joel R","surname":"Koo","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Alex R","surname":"Cook","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Minah","surname":"Park","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Yinxiaohe","surname":"Sun","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Haoyang","surname":"Sun","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Jue Tao","surname":"Lim","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Clarence","surname":"Tam","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Borame L","surname":"Dickens","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"10.2807/1560-7917.ES.2020.25.5.2000080","date":"2020-02-06","title":"Effectiveness of airport screening at detecting travellers infected with novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV)","abstract":"We evaluated effectiveness of thermal passenger screening for 2019-nCoV infection at airport exit and entry to inform public health decision-making.\n In our baseline scenario, we estimated that 46% (95% confidence interval: 36 to 58) of infected travellers would not be detected, depending on incubation period, sensitivity of exit and entry screening, and proportion of asymptomatic cases.\n Airport screening is unlikely to detect a sufficient proportion of 2019-nCoV infected travellers to avoid entry of infected travellers.\n","id":"PMC7014668","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC)","authors":[{"firstname":"Billy J","surname":"Quilty","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Sam","surname":"Clifford","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Sam","surname":"Clifford","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"NULL","surname":"NULL","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Stefan","surname":"Flasche","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Rosalind M","surname":"Eggo","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"10.1101/2020.01.28.20019224","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Estimated effectiveness of traveller screening to prevent international spread of 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV)","abstract":"id='P1'>Traveller screening is being used to limit further global spread of 2019 novel coronavirus (nCoV) following its recent emergence.\n Here, we project the impact of different travel screening programs given remaining uncertainty around the values of key nCoV life history and epidemiological parameters.\n Even under best-case assumptions, we estimate that screening will miss more than half of infected travellers.\n Breaking down the factors leading to screening successes and failures, we find that most cases missed by screening are fundamentally undetectable, because they have not yet developed symptoms and are unaware they were exposed.\n These findings emphasize the need for measures to track travellers who become ill after being missed by a travel screening program.\n We make our model available for interactive use so stakeholders can explore scenarios of interest using the most up-to-date information.\n We hope these findings contribute to evidence-based policy to combat the spread of nCoV, and to prospective planning to mitigate future emerging pathogens.\n","id":"PMC7216848","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory","authors":[{"firstname":"Katelyn M.","surname":"Gostic","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Ana C.

Covid-19","abstract":"Background\nNo therapeutics have yet been proven effective for the treatment of severe illness caused by SARS-CoV-2.\nMethods\nWe conducted a randomized, controlled, open-label trial involving hospitalized adult patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, which causes the respiratory illness Covid-19, and an oxygen saturation (Sao2) of 94% or less while they were breathing ambient air or a ratio of the partial pressure of oxygen (Pao2) to the fraction of inspired oxygen (Fio2) of less than 300 mm Hg.\n\n Patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either lopinavir–ritonavir (400 mg and 100 mg, respectively) twice a day for 14 days, in addition to standard care, or standard care alone.\n\n The primary end point was the time to clinical improvement, defined as the time from randomization to either an improvement of two points on a seven-category ordinal scale or discharge from the hospital, whichever came first.\n\n\nResults\nA total of 199 patients with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection underwent randomization; 99 were assigned to the lopinavir–ritonavir group, and 100 to the standard-care group.\n\n Treatment with lopinavir–ritonavir was not associated with a difference from standard care in the time to clinical improvement (hazard ratio for clinical improvement, 1.24; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.90 to 1.72).\n\n Mortality at 28 days was similar in the lopinavir–ritonavir group and the standard-care group (19.2% vs.\n\n 25.0%; difference, ?5.8 percentage points; 95% CI, ?17.3 to 5.7).\n\n The percentages of patients with detectable viral RNA at various time points were similar.\n\n In a modified intention-to-treat analysis, lopinavir–ritonavir led to a median time to clinical improvement that was shorter by 1 day than that observed with standard care (hazard ratio, 1.39; 95% CI, 1.00 to 1.91).\n\n Gastrointestinal adverse events were more common in the lopinavir–ritonavir group, but serious adverse events were more common in the standard-care group.\n\n Lopinavir–ritonavir treatment was stopped early in 13 patients (13.8%) because of adverse events.\n\n\nConclusions\nIn hospitalized adult patients with severe Covid-19, no benefit was observed with lopinavir–ritonavir treatment beyond standard care.\n\n Future trials in patients with severe illness may help to confirm

Vitro Antiviral Activity and Projection of Optimized Dosing Design of Hydroxychloroquine for the Treatment of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)","abstract":"Background\nThe Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) first broke out in Wuhan (China) and subsequently spread worldwide.\n\n Chloroquine has been sporadically used in treating SARS-CoV-2 infection.\n\n Hydroxychloroquine shares the same mechanism of action as chloroquine, but its more tolerable safety profile makes it the preferred drug to treat malaria and autoimmune conditions.\n\n We propose that the immunomodulatory effect of hydroxychloroquine also may be useful in controlling the cytokine storm that occurs late-phase in critically ill SARS-CoV-2 infected patients.\n\n Currently, there is no evidence to support the use of hydroxychloroquine in SARS-CoV-2 infection.\n\n\nMethods\nThe pharmacological activity of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine was tested using SARS-CoV-2 infected Vero cells.\n\n Physiologically-based pharmacokinetic models (PBPK) were implemented for both drugs separately by integrating their in vitro data.\n\n Using the PBPK models, hydroxychloroquine concentrations in lung fluid were simulated under 5 different dosing regimens to explore the most effective regimen whilst considering the drug’s safety profile.\n\n\nResults\nHydroxychloroquine (EC50=0.72 ?M) was found to be more potent than chloroquine (EC50=5.47 ?M) in vitro.\n\n Based on PBPK models results, a loading dose of 400 mg twice daily of hydroxychloroquine sulfate given orally, followed by a maintenance dose of 200 mg given twice daily for 4 days is recommended for SARS-CoV-2 infection, as it reached three times the potency of chloroquine phosphate when given 500 mg twice daily 5 days in advance.\n\n\nConclusions\nHydroxychloroquine was found to be more potent than chloroquine to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7108130","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Oxford University

Covid-19","abstract":"Background\nNo therapeutics have yet been proven effective for the treatment of severe illness caused by SARS-CoV-2.\nMethods\nWe conducted a randomized, controlled, open-label trial involving hospitalized adult patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, which causes the respiratory illness Covid-19, and an oxygen saturation (Sao2) of 94% or less while they were breathing ambient air or a ratio of the partial pressure of oxygen (Pao2) to the fraction of inspired oxygen (Fio2) of less than 300 mm Hg.\n\n Patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either lopinavir–ritonavir (400 mg and 100 mg, respectively) twice a day for 14 days, in addition to standard care, or standard care alone.\n\n The primary end point was the time to clinical improvement, defined as the time from randomization to either an improvement of two points on a seven-category ordinal scale or discharge from the hospital, whichever came first.\n\n\nResults\nA total of 199 patients with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection underwent randomization; 99 were assigned to the lopinavir–ritonavir group, and 100 to the standard-care group.\n\n Treatment with lopinavir–ritonavir was not associated with a difference from standard care in the time to clinical improvement (hazard ratio for clinical improvement, 1.24; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.90 to 1.72).\n\n Mortality at 28 days was similar in the lopinavir–ritonavir group and the standard-care group (19.2% vs.\n\n 25.0%; difference, ?5.8 percentage points; 95% CI, ?17.3 to 5.7).\n\n The percentages of patients with detectable viral RNA at various time points were similar.\n\n In a modified intention-to-treat analysis, lopinavir–ritonavir led to a median time to clinical improvement that was shorter by 1 day than that observed with standard care (hazard ratio, 1.39; 95% CI, 1.00 to 1.91).\n\n Gastrointestinal adverse events were more common in the lopinavir–ritonavir group, but serious adverse events were more common in the standard-care group.\n\n Lopinavir–ritonavir treatment was stopped early in 13 patients (13.8%) because of adverse events.\n\n\nConclusions\nIn hospitalized adult patients with severe Covid-19, no benefit was observed with lopinavir–ritonavir treatment beyond standard care.\n\n Future trials in patients with severe illness may help to confirm or exclude the possibility of a treatment benefit.\n\n (Funded by Major Projects of National Science and Technology on New Drug Creation and Development and others; Chinese Clinical Trial Register

compassionate-use basis to patients hospitalized with Covid-19, the illness caused by infection with SARS-CoV-2. Patients were those with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection who had an oxygen saturation of 94% or less while they were breathing ambient air or who were receiving oxygen support.\n\n Patients received a 10-day course of remdesivir, consisting of 200 mg administered intravenously on day 1, followed by 100 mg daily for the remaining 9 days of treatment.\n\n This report is based on data from patients who received remdesivir during the period from January 25, 2020, through March 7, 2020, and have clinical data for at least 1 subsequent day.\n\n\nResults\nOf the 61 patients who received at least one dose of remdesivir, data from 8 could not be analyzed (including 7 patients with no post-treatment data and 1 with a dosing error).\n\n Of the 53 patients whose data were analyzed, 22 were in the United States, 22 in Europe or Canada, and 9 in Japan.\n\n At baseline, 30 patients (57%) were receiving mechanical ventilation and 4 (8%) were receiving extracorporeal membrane oxygenation.\n\n During a median follow-up of 18 days, 36 patients (68%) had an improvement in oxygen-support class, including 17 of 30 patients (57%) receiving mechanical ventilation who were extubated.\n\n A total

receptor (A129) or the STAT1 signaling molecule (STAT129) were highly susceptible to infection and disease, succumbing within 6–7 days.\n Importantly, these animals developed viscerotropic disease reminiscent of human YF, instead of the encephalitic signs typically observed in mice.\n Rapid viremic dissemination and extensive replication in visceral organs, spleen and liver, was associated with severe pathologies in these tissues and dramatically elevated MCP-1 and IL-6 levels, suggestive of a cytokine storm.\n In striking contrast, infection of A129 and STAT129 mice with the 17D-204 vaccine virus was subclinical, similar to immunization in humans.\n Although, like wild-type YFV, 17D-204 virus amplified within regional lymph nodes and seeded a serum viremia in A129 mice, infection of visceral organs was rarely established and rapidly cleared, possibly by type II IFN-dependent mechanisms.\n The ability to establish systemic infection and cause viscerotropic disease in A129 mice correlated with infectivity for A129-derived, but not WT129-derived, macrophages and dendritic cells in vitro, suggesting a role for these cells in YFV pathogenesis.\n We conclude that the ability of wild-type YFV to evade and/or disable components of the IFN-?/? response may be primate-specific such that infection of mice with a functional IFN-?/? antiviral response is attenuated.\n Consequently, subcutaneous YFV infection of A129 mice represents a biologically relevant model for studying viscerotropic infection and disease development following wild-type virus inoculation, as well as mechanisms of 17D-204 vaccine attenuation, without a requirement for adaptation of the virus.\n","id":"PMC2749449","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Public Library of Science","authors":[{"firstname":"Kathryn C.","surname":"Meier","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Christina L.","surname":"Gardner","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Mikhail V.","surname":"Khoretonenko","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"William B.","surname":"Klimstra","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Kate D.","surname":"Ryman","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Ralph S.","surname":"Baric","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ralph S.","surname":"Baric","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1007/s40264-016-0420-2","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Pharmacokinetics, Efficacy, and Safety of Hepatitis C Virus Drugs in Patients with Liver and/or Renal Impairment","abstract":"Hepatitis C virus (HCV)-infected patients often suffer from liver cirrhosis, which can be complicated by renal impairment.\n Therefore, in this review we describe the treatment possibilities in HCV patients with hepatic and renal impairment.\n Cirrhosis alters the structure of the liver, which affects drug-metabolizing enzymes and drug transporters.\n These modifications influence the plasma concentration of substrates of drugs metabolized/transported by these enzymes.\n The direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) are substrates of, for example, cytochrome P450 enzymes in the liver.\n Most DAAs are not studied in HCV-infected individuals with decompensated cirrhosis, and therefore awareness is needed when these patients are treated.\n Most DAAs are contraindicated in cirrhotic patients; however, patients with a Child-Pugh score of B or C can be treated safely with a normal dose sofosbuvir plus ledipasvir or daclatasvir, in combination with ribavirin.\n Patients with renal impairment (glomerular filtration rate [GFR] &lt;90 mL/min) or who are dependent on dialysis often tolerate ribavirin treatment poorly, even after dose adjustments.\n However, most DAAs can be used at the normal dose because DAAs are not renally excreted.\n To date, grazoprevir plus elbasvir is the preferred DAA regimen in patients with renal impairment as data are pending for sofosbuvir patients with GFR &lt;30 mL/min (as for ledipasvir and velpatasvir).\n However, sofosbuvir has been used in a small number of patients with severe renal impairment and, based on these trials, we recommend sofosbuvir 400 mg every day when no other DAA regimen is available.\n Ledipasvir and velpatasvir are not recommended in patients with severe renal impairment.\n","id":"PMC4912979","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Springer International Publishing","authors":[{"firstname":"Elise J.","surname":"Smolders","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Clara T.

Model","abstract":"Zika virus (ZIKV) is an emerging flavivirus typically causing a dengue-like febrile illness, but neurological complications, such as microcephaly in newborns, have potentially been linked to this viral infection.\n We established a panel of in vitro assays to allow the identification of ZIKV inhibitors and demonstrate that the viral polymerase inhibitor 7-deaza-2’-C-methyladenosine (7DMA) efficiently inhibits replication.\n Infection of AG129 (IFN-?/? and IFN-? receptor knock-out) mice with ZIKV resulted in acute neutrophilic encephalitis with viral antigens accumulating in neurons of the brain and spinal cord.\n Additionally, high levels of viral RNA were detected in the spleen, liver and kidney, and levels of IFN-? and IL-18 were systematically increased in serum of ZIKV-infected mice.\n Interestingly, the virus was also detected in testicles of infected mice.\n In line with its in vitro anti-ZIKV activity, 7DMA reduced viremia and delayed virus-induced morbidity and mortality in infected mice, which also validates this small animal model to assess the in vivo efficacy of novel ZIKV inhibitors.\n Since AG129 mice can generate an antibody response, and have been used in dengue vaccine studies, the model can also be used to assess the efficacy of ZIKV vaccines.\n

These features include modifications on the sugar (2? or 3? modifications, carbocyclic, acyclic, or dideoxynucleotides) or on the base.\n The goal is to identify nucleotide analogues that not only terminate RNA synthesis catalyzed by these coronavirus RdRps, but also have the potential to resist the viruses' exonuclease activity.\n We examined these nucleotide analogues for their ability to be incorporated by the RdRps in the polymerase reaction and to prevent further incorporation.\n While all 11 molecules tested displayed incorporation, 6 exhibited immediate termination of the polymerase reaction (triphosphates of Carbovir, Ganciclovir, Stavudine and Entecavir; 3?-OMe-UTP and Biotin-16-dUTP), 2 showed delayed termination (Cidofovir diphosphate and 2?-OMe-UTP), and 3 did not terminate the polymerase reaction (2?-F-dUTP, 2?–NH2–dUTP and Desthiobiotin-16-UTP).\n The coronaviruses possess an exonuclease that apparently requires a 2?-OH at the 3?-terminus of the growing RNA strand for proofreading.\n In this study, all nucleoside triphosphate analogues evaluated form Watson-Crick-like base pairs.\n The nucleotide analogues demonstrating termination either lack a 2?-OH, have a blocked 2?-OH, or show delayed termination.\n Thus, these nucleotide analogues are of interest for further investigation to evaluate whether they can evade the viral exonuclease activity.\n Prodrugs of five of these nucleotide analogues (Cidofovir, Abacavir, Valganciclovir/Ganciclovir, Stavudine and Entecavir) are FDA-approved medications for treatment of other viral infections, and their safety profiles are well established.\n After demonstrating potency in inhibiting viral replication in cell culture, candidate molecules can be rapidly evaluated as potential therapies for COVID-19.","id":"PMC7299870","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Elsevier B.V.","authors":[{"firstname":"Steffen","surname":"Jockusch","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Chuanjuan","surname":"Tao","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Xiaoxu","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Thomas K.","surname":"Anderson","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Minchen","surname":"Chien","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Shiv","surname":"Kumar","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"James J.","surname":"Russo","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Robert N.","surname":"Kirchdoerfer","email":"rnkirchdoerf@wisc.edu","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Jingyue","surname":"Ju","email":"dj222@columbia.edu","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"10.1073/pnas.1323705111","date":"1970-01-01","title":"One severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus protein complex integrates processive RNA polymerase and exonuclease activities","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1038/s41467-019-10280-3","date":"2019-05-02","title":"Structure of the SARS-CoV nsp12 polymerase bound to nsp7 and nsp8 co-factors","abstract":"id='Par1'>Recent history is punctuated by the emergence of highly pathogenic coronaviruses such as SARS- and MERS-CoV into human circulation.\n Upon infecting host cells, coronaviruses assemble a multi-subunit RNA-synthesis complex of viral non-structural proteins (nsp) responsible for the replication and transcription of the viral genome.\n Here, we present the 3.1?Å resolution structure of the SARS-CoV nsp12 polymerase bound to its essential co-factors, nsp7 and nsp8, using single particle cryo-electron microscopy.\n nsp12 possesses an architecture common to all viral polymerases as well as a large N-terminal extension containing a kinase-like fold and is bound by two nsp8 co-factors.\n This structure illuminates the assembly of the coronavirus core RNA-synthesis machinery, provides key insights into nsp12 polymerase catalysis and fidelity and acts as a template for the design of novel antiviral therapeutics.\n","id":"PMC6538669","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Nature Publishing Group UK","authors":[{"firstname":"Robert N.","surname":"Kirchdoerfer","email":"rkirchdo@scripps.edu","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Andrew B.","surname":"Ward","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Andrew B.","surname":"Ward","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.14218/JCTH.2013.004XX","date":"2013-03-15","title":"Advances in Nucleotide Antiviral Development from Scientific Discovery to Clinical Applications: Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate for Hepatitis B","abstract":"Exploration of naturally occurring chemical structures for medicinal uses has received significant interest in drug discovery and development research in the past few decades.\n None have had more success or products of greater clinical efficacy than synthetic analogs of nucleosides and nucleotides, especially as antiviral drugs.\n Nucleos(t)ide antivirals are synthetic analogs of the natural building blocks of DNA or RNA.\n This review focuses on the developmental path of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF), a prodrug of a nucleotide analog and its clinical applications as a first-line antiviral for chronic hepatitis B (CHB).\n","id":"PMC4521268","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"XIA &amp;

rich features for handling complex experimental designs and for information borrowing to overcome the problem of small sample sizes.\n Over the past decade, limma has been a popular choice for gene discovery through differential expression analyses of microarray and high-throughput PCR data.\n The package contains particularly strong facilities for reading, normalizing and exploring such data.\n Recently, the capabilities of limma have been significantly expanded in two important directions.\n First, the package can now perform both differential expression and differential splicing analyses of RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data.\n All the downstream analysis tools previously restricted to microarray data are now available for RNA-seq as well.\n These capabilities allow users to analyse both RNA-seq and microarray data with very similar pipelines.\n Second, the package is now able to go past the traditional gene-wise expression analyses in a variety of ways, analysing expression profiles in terms of co-regulated sets of genes or in terms of higher-order expression signatures.\n This provides enhanced possibilities for biological interpretation of gene expression differences.\n This article reviews the philosophy and design of the limma package, summarizing both new and historical features, with an emphasis on recent enhancements and features that have not been previously

aberrant gene expression and activates neuroprotective pathways in the YAC128 HD mouse","abstract":"Background\nid='Par1'>Huntington Disease (HD) is an incurable autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disorder driven by an expansion repeat giving rise to the mutant huntingtin protein (mHtt), which is known to disrupt a multitude of transcriptional pathways.\n\n Pridopidine, a small molecule in development for treatment of HD, has been shown to improve motor symptoms in HD patients.\n\n In HD animal models, pridopidine exerts neuroprotective effects and improves behavioral and motor functions.\n\n Pridopidine binds primarily to the sigma-1 receptor, (IC50 ~?100 nM), which mediates its neuroprotective properties, such as rescue of spine density and aberrant calcium signaling in HD neuronal cultures.\n\n Pridopidine enhances brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) secretion, which is blocked by putative sigma-1 receptor antagonist NE-100, and was shown to upregulate transcription of genes in the BDNF, glucocorticoid receptor (GR), and dopamine D1 receptor (D1R) pathways in the rat striatum.\n\n The impact of different doses of pridopidine on gene expression and transcript splicing in HD across relevant brain regions was explored, utilizing the YAC128 HD mouse model, which carries the entire human mHtt gene containing 128 CAG repeats.\n\n\nMethods\nid='Par2'>RNAseq was analyzed from striatum, cortex, and hippocampus of wild-type and YAC128 mice treated with vehicle, 10 mg/kg or 30 mg/kg pridopidine from the presymptomatic stage (1.5 months of age) until 11.5 months of age in which mice exhibit progressive disease phenotypes.\n\n\nResults\nid='Par3'>The most pronounced transcriptional effect of pridopidine at both doses was observed in the striatum with minimal effects in other regions.\n\n In addition, for the first time pridopidine was found to have a dose-dependent impact on alternative exon and junction usage, a regulatory mechanism known to be impaired in HD.\n\n In the striatum of YAC128 HD mice, pridopidine treatment initiation prior to symptomatic manifestation rescues the impaired expression of the BDNF, GR, D1R and cAMP pathways.\n\n\nConclusions\nid='Par4'>Pridopidine has broad effects on restoring transcriptomic disturbances in the striatum, particularly involving synaptic transmission and activating neuroprotective pathways that are disturbed in HD.\n\n Benefits of treatment initiation at early disease stages track with trends observed in the clinic.\n\n\nElectronic supplementary material\nThe online version of this article (10.1186/s13024-018-0259-3) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized

Enzyme kinetics indicated that this RdRp efficiently incorporates the active triphosphate form of RDV (RDV-TP) into RNA.\n Incorporation of RDV-TP at position i caused termination of RNA synthesis at position i+3. We obtained almost identical results with SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 RdRps.\n A unique property of RDV-TP is its high selectivity over incorporation of its natural nucleotide counterpart ATP.\n In this regard, the triphosphate forms of 2?-C-methylated compounds, including sofosbuvir, approved for the management of hepatitis C virus infection, and the broad-acting antivirals favipiravir and ribavirin, exhibited significant deficits.\n Furthermore, we provide evidence for the target specificity of RDV, as RDV-TP was less efficiently incorporated by the distantly related Lassa virus RdRp, and termination of RNA synthesis was not observed.\n These results collectively provide a unifying, refined mechanism of RDV-mediated RNA synthesis inhibition in coronaviruses and

Remdesivir use was not associated with a difference in time to clinical improvement (hazard ratio 1·23 [95% CI 0·87–1·75]).\n\n Although not statistically significant, patients receiving remdesivir had a numerically faster time to clinical improvement than those receiving placebo among patients with symptom duration of 10 days or less (hazard ratio 1·52 [0·95–2·43]).\n\n Adverse events were reported in 102 (66%) of 155 remdesivir recipients versus 50 (64%) of 78 placebo recipients.\n\n Remdesivir was stopped early because of adverse events in 18 (12%) patients versus four (5%) patients who stopped placebo early.\n\n\nInterpretation\nIn this study of adult patients admitted to hospital for severe COVID-19, remdesivir was not associated with statistically significant clinical benefits.\n\n However, the numerical reduction in time to clinical improvement in those treated earlier requires confirmation in larger studies.\n\n\nFunding\nChinese Academy of Medical Sciences

viral spread1,2.\n PLpro is also implicated in cleaving proteinaceous post-translational modifications on host proteins as an evasion mechanism against host antiviral immune responses3–5.\n Here we perform biochemical, structural and functional characterization of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) PLpro (SCoV2-PLpro) and outline differences with SARS-CoV PLpro (SCoV-PLpro) in regulation of host interferon and NF-?B pathways.\n SCoV2-PLpro and SCoV-PLpro share 83% sequence identity but exhibit different host substrate preferences; SCoV2-PLpro preferentially cleaves the ubiquitin-like interferon-stimulated gene 15 protein (ISG15), whereas SCoV-PLpro predominantly targets ubiquitin chains.\n The crystal structure of SCoV2-PLpro in complex with ISG15 reveals distinctive interactions with the amino-terminal ubiquitin-like domain of ISG15, highlighting the high affinity and specificity of these interactions.\n Furthermore, upon infection, SCoV2-PLpro contributes to the cleavage of ISG15 from interferon responsive factor 3 (IRF3) and attenuates type I interferon responses.\n Notably, inhibition of SCoV2-PLpro with GRL-0617 impairs the virus-induced cytopathogenic effect, maintains the antiviral interferon pathway and reduces viral replication in infected cells.\n These results highlight a potential dual therapeutic strategy in

definitive treatment for this disease.\n\n The researchers tried different treatment options which are not specific.\n\n The current study aims to identify potential small molecule inhibitors against the main protease protein of SARS-CoV-2 by the computational approach.\n\n\nMain methods\nIn this study, a virtual screening procedure employing docking of the two different datasets from the ZINC database, including 1615 FDA approved drugs and 4266 world approved drugs were used to identify new potential small molecule inhibitors for the newly released crystal structure of main protease protein of SARS-CoV-2. In the following to validate the docking result, molecular dynamics simulations were applied on selected ligands to identify the behavior and stability of them in the binding pocket of the main protease in 150 nanoseconds (ns).\n\n Furthermore, binding energy using the MMPBSA approach was also calculated.\n\n\nKey findings\nThe result indicates that simeprevir (Hepatitis C virus NS3/4A protease inhibitor) and pyronaridine (antimalarial agent) could fit well to the binding pocket of the main protease and because of some other beneficial features including broad-spectrum antiviral properties and ADME profile, they might be a promising drug candidate for repurposing to the treatment of COVID-19.\nSignificance\nSimeprevir and pyronaridine were selected by the combination of virtual screening and molecular dynamics simulation approaches as a potential candidate for treatment of COVID-19.\n","id":"PMC7413873","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Elsevier Inc.","authors":[{"firstname":"Faezeh Sadat","surname":"Hosseini","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Massoud","surname":"Amanlou","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"10.1080/07391102.2020.1813200","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Repurposing Simeprevir, Calpain Inhibitor IV and a Cathepsin F Inhibitor against SARS-CoV-2 and Insights into Their Interactions with Mpro","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1038/s41598-020-70863-9","date":"2020-07-31","title":"An integrated drug repurposing strategy for the rapid identification of potential SARS-CoV-2 viral inhibitors","abstract":"id='Par1'>The Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).\n The virus has rapidly spread in humans, causing the ongoing Coronavirus pandemic.\n Recent studies have shown that, similarly to SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 utilises the Spike glycoprotein on the envelope to recognise and bind the human receptor ACE2.

pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 remain poorly understood.\n\n We evaluate its tissue and cellular tropism in human respiratory tract, conjunctiva, and innate immune responses in comparison with other coronavirus and influenza virus to provide insights into COVID-19 pathogenesis.\n\n\nMethods\nWe isolated SARS-CoV-2 from a patient with confirmed COVID-19, and compared virus tropism and replication competence with SARS-CoV, Middle East respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and 2009 pandemic influenza H1N1 (H1N1pdm) in ex-vivo cultures of human bronchus (n=5) and lung (n=4).\n\n We assessed extrapulmonary infection using ex-vivo cultures of human conjunctiva (n=3) and in-vitro cultures of human colorectal adenocarcinoma cell lines.\n\n Innate immune responses and angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 expression were investigated in human alveolar epithelial cells and macrophages.\n\n In-vitro studies included the highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 virus (H5N1) and mock-infected cells as controls.\n\n\nFindings\nSARS-CoV-2 infected ciliated, mucus-secreting, and club cells of bronchial epithelium, type 1 pneumocytes in the lung, and the conjunctival mucosa.\n\n In the bronchus, SARS-CoV-2 replication competence was similar to MERS-CoV, and higher than SARS-CoV, but lower than H1N1pdm.\n\n In the lung, SARS-CoV-2 replication was similar to

by a newly identified coronavirus, (SARS?CoV?2).\n\n We systematically reviewed the clinical outcomes of using antiretroviral drugs for the prevention and treatment of coronaviruses and planned clinical trials.\n\n\nMethods\nThree databases were screened from inception to 30 March 2020 for studies reporting clinical outcomes of patients with SARS, MERS or COVID?19 treated with antiretrovirals.\n\n\nResults\nFrom an initial screen of 433 titles, two randomized trials and 24 observational studies provided clinical outcome data on the use of antiretroviral drugs; most studies reported outcomes using LPV/r as treatment.\n\n Of the 21 observational studies reporting treatment outcomes, there were three studies among patients with SARS, six studies among patients with MERS and 12 studies among patients with COVID?19. In one randomized trial 99 patients with severe COVID?19 illness were randomized to receive LPV/r (400/100 mg twice a day) and 100 patients to standard of care for 14 days: LPV/r was not associated with a statistically significant difference in time to clinical improvement, although LPV/r given within 12 days of symptoms was associated with shorter time to clinical improvement; 28 day mortality was numerically lower in the LPV/r group (14/99) compared to the control group (25/100), but this difference was not statistically significant.\n\n The second trial found no benefit.\n\n The certainty of the evidence for the randomized trials was low.\n\n In the observational studies 3 out of 361 patients who received LPV/r died; the certainty of evidence was very low.\n\n Three studies reported a possible protective effect of LPV/r as post?exposure prophylaxis.\n\n Again, the certainty of the evidence was very low due to uncertainty due to limited sample size.\n\n\nConclusions\nOn the basis of the available evidence it is uncertain whether LPV/r and other antiretrovirals improve clinical outcomes or prevent infection among patients at high risk of acquiring

and an oxygen saturation (Sao2) of 94% or less while they were breathing ambient air or a ratio of the partial pressure of oxygen (Pao2) to the fraction of inspired oxygen (Fio2) of less than 300 mm Hg.\n\n Patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either lopinavir–ritonavir (400 mg and 100 mg, respectively) twice a day for 14 days, in addition to standard care, or standard care alone.\n\n The primary end point was the time to clinical improvement, defined as the time from randomization to either an improvement of two points on a seven-category ordinal scale or discharge from the hospital, whichever came first.\n\n\nResults\nA total of 199 patients with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection underwent randomization; 99 were assigned to the lopinavir–ritonavir group, and 100 to the standard-care group.\n\n Treatment with lopinavir–ritonavir was not associated with a difference from standard care in the time to clinical improvement (hazard ratio for clinical improvement, 1.24; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.90 to 1.72).\n\n Mortality at 28 days was similar in the lopinavir–ritonavir group and the standard-care group (19.2% vs.\n\n 25.0%; difference, ?5.8 percentage points; 95% CI, ?17.3 to 5.7).\n\n The percentages of patients with detectable viral RNA at various time points were similar.\n\n In a modified intention-to-treat analysis, lopinavir–ritonavir led to a median time to clinical improvement that was shorter by 1 day than that observed with standard care (hazard ratio, 1.39; 95% CI, 1.00 to 1.91).\n\n Gastrointestinal adverse events were more common in the lopinavir–ritonavir group, but serious adverse events were more common in the standard-care group.\n\n Lopinavir–ritonavir treatment was stopped early in 13 patients (13.8%) because of adverse events.\n\n\nConclusions\nIn hospitalized adult patients with severe Covid-19, no benefit was observed with lopinavir–ritonavir treatment beyond standard care.\n\n

physiological small animal model that resembles COVID-19 with low mortality is lacking.\n\n\nMethods\nMolecular docking on the binding between angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) of common laboratory mammals and the receptor-binding domain of the surface spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 suggested that the golden Syrian hamster is an option.\n\n Virus challenge, contact transmission, and passive immunoprophylaxis were performed.\n\n Serial organ tissues and blood were harvested for histopathology, viral load and titre, chemokine/cytokine assay, and neutralising antibody titre.\n\n\nResults\nThe Syrian hamster could be consistently infected by SARS-CoV-2. Maximal clinical signs of rapid breathing, weight loss, histopathological changes from the initial exudative phase of diffuse alveolar damage with extensive apoptosis to the later proliferative phase of tissue repair, airway and intestinal involvement with virus nucleocapsid protein expression, high lung viral load, and spleen and lymphoid atrophy associated with marked cytokine activation were observed within the first week of virus challenge.\n\n The lung virus titre was between 105-107 TCID50/g.\n\n Challenged index hamsters consistently infected naïve contact hamsters housed within the same cage, resulting in similar pathology but not weight loss.\n\n All infected hamsters recovered and developed mean serum neutralising antibody titre ?1:427 fourteen days post-challenge.\n\n Immunoprophylaxis with early convalescent serum achieved significant decrease in lung viral load but not in lung pathology.\n\n No consistent non-synonymous adaptive mutation of the spike was found in viruses isolated from infected hamsters.\n\n\nConclusions\nBesides satisfying the Koch’s postulates, this readily available hamster model is an important tool for studying transmission, pathogenesis,

samples and serum antibody responses during infection by SARS-CoV-2: an observational cohort study","abstract":"Background\nCoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) causes severe community and nosocomial outbreaks.\n\n Comprehensive data for serial respiratory viral load and serum antibody responses from patients infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) are not yet available.\n\n Nasopharyngeal and throat swabs are usually obtained for serial viral load monitoring of respiratory infections but gathering these specimens can cause discomfort for patients and put health-care workers at risk.\n\n We aimed to ascertain the serial respiratory viral load of SARS-CoV-2 in posterior oropharyngeal (deep throat) saliva samples from patients with COVID-19, and serum antibody responses.\n\n\nMethods\nWe did a cohort study at two hospitals in Hong Kong.\n\n We included patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19. We obtained samples of blood, urine, posterior oropharyngeal saliva, and rectal swabs.\n\n Serial viral load was ascertained by reverse transcriptase quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR).\n\n Antibody levels against the SARS-CoV-2 internal nucleoprotein (NP) and surface spike protein receptor binding domain (RBD) were measured using EIA.\n\n Whole-genome sequencing was done to identify possible mutations arising during infection.\n\n\nFindings\nBetween Jan 22, 2020, and Feb 12, 2020, 30 patients were screened for inclusion, of whom 23 were included (median age 62 years [range 37–75]).\n\n The median viral load in posterior oropharyngeal saliva or other respiratory specimens at presentation was 5·2 log10 copies per mL (IQR 4·1–7·0).\n\n Salivary viral load was highest during the first week after symptom onset and subsequently declined with time (slope ?0·15, 95% CI ?0·19 to ?0·11; R2=0·71).\n\n In one patient, viral RNA was detected 25 days after symptom onset.\n\n Older age was correlated with higher viral load (Spearman's ?=0·48, 95% CI 0·074–0·75; p=0·020).\n\n For 16 patients with serum samples available 14 days or longer after symptom onset, rates of seropositivity were 94% for anti-NP IgG (n=15), 88% for anti-NP IgM (n=14), 100% for anti-RBD IgG (n=16), and 94% for anti-RBD IgM (n=15).\n\n Anti-SARS-CoV-2-NP or anti-SARS-CoV-2-RBD IgG levels correlated with virus neutralisation titre (R2&gt;0·9).\n\n No genome mutations were detected on serial samples.\n\n\nInterpretation\nPosterior oropharyngeal saliva samples are a non-invasive specimen more acceptable to patients and health-care workers.\n\n Unlike severe acute respiratory syndrome, patients with COVID-19 had the highest viral load near presentation, which could account for the fast-spreading nature of this epidemic.\n\n This finding emphasises the importance of stringent infection control and early use of potent antiviral agents, alone or in combination, for high-risk individuals.\n\n Serological assay can complement RT-qPCR for diagnosis.\n\n\nFunding\nRichard and Carol Yu, May Tam Mak Mei Yin, The Shaw Foundation Hong Kong, Michael Tong, Marina Lee, Government Consultancy

Covid-19","abstract":"Background\nNo therapeutics have yet been proven effective for the treatment of severe illness caused by SARS-CoV-2.\nMethods\nWe conducted a randomized, controlled, open-label trial involving hospitalized adult patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, which causes the respiratory illness Covid-19, and an oxygen saturation (Sao2) of 94% or less while they were breathing ambient air or a ratio of the partial pressure of oxygen (Pao2) to the fraction of inspired oxygen (Fio2) of less than 300 mm Hg.\n\n Patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either lopinavir–ritonavir (400 mg and 100 mg, respectively) twice a day for 14 days, in addition to standard care, or standard care alone.\n\n The primary end point was the time to clinical improvement, defined as the time from randomization to either an improvement of two points on a seven-category ordinal scale or discharge from the hospital, whichever came first.\n\n\nResults\nA total of 199 patients with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection underwent randomization; 99 were assigned to the lopinavir–ritonavir group, and 100 to the standard-care group.\n\n Treatment with lopinavir–ritonavir was not associated with a difference from standard care in the time to clinical improvement (hazard ratio for clinical improvement, 1.24; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.90 to 1.72).\n\n Mortality at 28 days was similar in the lopinavir–ritonavir group and the standard-care group (19.2% vs.\n\n 25.0%; difference, ?5.8 percentage points; 95% CI, ?17.3 to 5.7).\n\n The percentages of patients with detectable viral RNA at various time points were similar.\n\n In a modified intention-to-treat analysis, lopinavir–ritonavir led to a median time to clinical improvement that was shorter by 1 day than that observed with standard care (hazard ratio, 1.39; 95% CI, 1.00 to 1.91).\n\n Gastrointestinal adverse events were more common in the lopinavir–ritonavir group, but serious adverse events were more common in the standard-care group.\n\n Lopinavir–ritonavir treatment was stopped early in 13 patients (13.8%) because of adverse events.\n\n\nConclusions\nIn hospitalized adult patients with severe Covid-19, no benefit was observed with lopinavir–ritonavir treatment beyond standard care.\n\n Future trials in patients with severe illness may help to confirm or exclude the possibility of a treatment benefit.\n\n (Funded by Major Projects of National Science and Technology on New Drug Creation and Development and others; Chinese Clinical Trial Register

an emerging coronavirus that has resulted in nearly 1,000,000 laboratory-confirmed cases including over 50,000 deaths.\n\n Although SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV share a number of common clinical manifestations, SARS-CoV-2 appears to be highly efficient in person-to-person transmission and frequently cause asymptomatic infections.\n\n However, the underlying mechanism that confers these viral characteristics on high transmissibility and asymptomatic infection remain incompletely understood.\n\n\nMethods\nWe comprehensively investigated the replication, cell tropism, and immune activation

SARS-CoV.\n\n Within the 48-hour interval, SARS-CoV-2 generated 3.20 folds more infectious virus particles than that of SARS-CoV from the infected lung tissues (P&lt;0.024).\n\n SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV were similar in cell tropism, with both targeting types I and II pneumocytes, and alveolar macrophages.\n\n Importantly, despite the more efficient virus replication, SARS-CoV-2 did not

Subjects were divided into two arms with one arm receiving ribavirin and the other receiving sofosbuvir/daclatasvir.

In our armamentarium of possible treatments, we have convalescent serum, repurposing existing approved drugs that may have a useful impact on this virus, and new developments such as vaccines or new small-molecule antivirals.\nWe reasoned that with SARS-CoV-2, HCV and HIV all being positive-sense RNA viruses, antivirals that work for HCV and HIV might exhibit a spectrum that encompasses SARS-CoV-2. With the initial step in the duplication of HIV being reverse transcription, we further reasoned that there is substantially more lifecycle homology between SARS-CoV-2 and HCV as both use an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase.\nIn the realm of antivirals, we see two broad strategies: inhibition of duplication of the genetic material via nucleoside or nucleotide analogues (NUCs) or inhibition of the key viral proteins. With the genetic alphabet of RNA consisting of the letters CGAU, we reasoned NUCs targeting the need to incorporate these genetic letters into the elongating RNA strand had the highest probability of success. Ribavirin is a weak NUC and a fake letter 'G'. Remdesivir is an NUC and a fake letter 'A'. Sofosbuvir is a strong NUC and a fake letter 'U'.\nThe SARS-CoV-2 replication and transcription cycle depends on several key enzymes, notably RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase (RdRp), main protease (Mpro) and helicase. The structures of SARS-CoV-2 RdRp and Mpro have been analysed and published in high resolution and are attractive targets to model antiviral drugs against. Some in silico and in vitro studies of sofosbuvir have predicted that it and other nucleoside/nucleotide analogues will bind strongly to the SARS-CoV-2 RdRp enzyme and inhibit its function. This is the same proposed mechanism of action as both remdesivir and favipiravir.\nSofosbuvir and remdesivir have chemical similarities including a molecular weight of 529.5 and 602.6 Da, respectively, and predicted SARS-CoV-2 RdRp binding strength of -4.41 and -5.16 kcal/mol, respectively; however, sofosbuvir is much more easily absorbed orally. Results have not always been congruent because computer models use different formulae and make different assumptions, and in vitro analyses use different cell lines under different conditions.\nOne deep-learning model suggested that daclatasvir would have a binding strength to SARS-CoV-2 RdRp of 23.31 Kd, which is similar to remdesivir (20.17 Kd). However, another modelling study compared the binding strength of 88 antiviral drugs with SARS-CoV-2 Mpro, and found daclatasvir to be one of the weakest binders to the enzyme (MolDock score -45.44)\nSofosbuvir is available in Iran as a fixed-dose tablet where it is combined with daclatasvir (doses of 400 and 60 mg respectively). With molecular modelling predicting daclatasvir may also have activity against SARS-CoV-2, using this tablet was both pragmatic and offered the possibility of delivering a potential extra benefit from the daclatasvir.\nLike interferon, ribavirin is known to have a broad spectrum of antiviral activity. Our research team differed in personal opinions about whether sofosbuvir/daclatasvir or ribavirin would be more effective. With the national standard COVID-19 treatment protocol at the time being lopinavir/ritonavir 200/50 mg two tablets every 12 h plus hydroxychloroquine 400 mg daily, it was decided to conduct a two-arm trial where both arms would receive the standard protocol in addition to either ribavirin or sofosbuvir/daclatasvir.\nMaterials and methods\nThis open-label parallel trial was conducted at the Abadan Faculty of Medical Sciences affiliated to Taleghani Hospital in Abadan city, the epicentre of the COVID-19 outbreak in Khuzestan Province located in southwestern Iran. Patients were enrolled between 18 March 2020 and 16 April 2020 and their clinical course was followed for the 3 weeks immediately following commencement of trial medication.\nInclusion and exclusion criteria\nEnrolment was only offered to hospitalized patients with a positive nasopharyngeal swab RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 or bilateral multi-lobar ground-glass opacity on their chest CT and signs of severe COVID-19, defined as oxygen saturation less than 94% or respiratory rate above 24 or decreased level of consciousness. The RT-PCR test used was qualitative, not quantitative. The exclusion criteria were subjects under 18 years, pregnant and breast-feeding women, those with severe anaemia (haemoglobin &lt;7 mg/dL) or with prior use of medicine for COVID-19, and subjects not consenting to the study.\nStudy arms\nSubjects were divided into two arms. One arm received a single daily pill containing 400 mg sofosbuvir and 60 mg daclatasvir (Sovodak, Fanavaran Rojan Mohaghegh Daru Co, Tehran, Iran) and the other received 600 mg ribavirin (Bakhtar Biochemistry Co, Kermanshah, Iran) every 12 h. Treatment was administered during admission for a maximum of 14 days. In addition, both arms received the national standard treatment protocol, which was at the time lopinavir/ritonavir 200/50 mg, two tablets every 12 h during admission for a maximum of 5 days, and hydroxychloroquine 400 mg single dose on admission. All study medication was discontinued at discharge.\nAllocation\nCOVID subjects in Taleghani hospital are managed by six different specialists in infectious disease. Three of these specialists allocated all their patients to the ribavirin arm and the other three to the sofosbuvir/daclatasvir arm. As a result, subjects were allocated to study arms based on which specialist was on-call at the time of their admission, so the allocation was not blinded and pseudorandom rather than fully random. Subjects in either arm were admitted in the same dedicated COVID-19 wards with the same hospital staff.\nOutcomes\nThe primary outcome measured was the time from starting the trial medications until discharge from hospital. Patients were discharged when clinical improvement was observed, defined as oxygen saturation 98% or higher, respiratory rate 18/min or less, and temperature under 37.5 C. The secondary outcomes measured were duration of stay in ICU, mortality, respiratory rate, laboratory values and adverse effects. Subjects were contacted daily after hospital discharge and asked about complications and re-admissions for 21 days.\nStatistical analysis\nOutcomes and baseline characteristics were summarized using descriptive statistics. The chi2 test was used to compare categorical outcomes between groups and the independent t-test was used for continuous outcomes. The primary outcome, time to hospital discharge, was assessed considering all individuals who died as right censored at the maximum follow-up time. Time to hospital discharge was plotted and compared with a log-rank test. Cox proportional hazards models were used to adjust the primary outcome for baseline characteristics that may confound results. Relative risks of binary outcomes are presented with the corresponding 95% CI. The number needed to treat (NNT) was calculated as the reciprocal of the risk difference. A P value &lt;0.05 was considered to be significant.\nNo sample size calculation was performed. All eligible patients admitted with COVID-19 over a 4 week period were enrolled.\nThe trial was approved by the Ethics Committee of Abadan Faculty of Medical Sciences (IR.ABADANUMS.REC.1398.113). Written informed consent was obtained from all patients or their legal representatives. Subjects were free to exit the study whenever they chose. The authors were involved in the design, data collection and analysis of the trial and approving the final version for publication. The study is registered in the Iranian Registry of Clinical Trials (IRCT ID: IRCT20200324046850N2, https://www.irct.ir/trial/46713).\nResults\nEighty-two patients with severe COVID-19 were admitted to Taleghani Hospital during the enrolment period. Twenty patients were excluded (2 died before allocation, 7 had prior COVID medicine use, 11 refused consent). Sixty-two patients who met the eligibility criteria were included (27 in the ribavirin arm and 35 in the sofosbuvir/daclatasvir arm). All patients reached the study endpoints of death or discharge from hospital during the study period and none were lost to follow-up (Figure 1). \nPatient enrolment process.\nThe median age was 62.5 years with an IQR between 46 and 71 years. The number of male and female patients enrolled was equal. There were no statistically significant differences between the two groups across a range of baseline observations (Table 1). \nDemographic and clinical characteristic of the patients at baseline\nCharacteristic	SOF/DCV (n = 35)	RBV (n = 27)	P value	 	General	 	 age, median (IQR)	62 (47-69)	60 (43-73)	0.69	 	 gender: male, n (%)	17 (49)	14 (52)	0.80	 	 BMI, median (IQR)	27 (24-29)	25 (23-28)	0.39	 	 smoker, n (%)	6 (17%)	5 (19%)	1.00	 	Coexisting conditions, n (%)	 	 diabetes	10 (29%)	7 (26%)	0.82	 	 chronic lung disease	1 (3%)	2 (7%)	0.41	 	 COPD	3 (8%)	2 (7%)	1.00	 	 asthma	2 (6%)	1 (3%)	1.00	 	 chronic renal failure	1 (2.9%)	1 (3.7%)	0.85	 	 cardiovascular disease	5 (14%)	7 (26%)	0.25	 	 coinfection	1 (3%)	6 (22%)	0.037	 	 other	3 (8.6%)	2 (7.4%)	0.87	 	Baseline observations	 	 Glasgow Coma Scale, median (IQR)	12 (11-14)	13 (12-15)	0.24	 	 respiratory rate, median (IQR)	24 (21-26)	24 (20-26)	0.31	 	 febrile, n (%)	35 (100%)	27 (100%)	1	 	 arterial O2 saturation (%), median (IQR)	92 (90-93)	92 (90-93)	0.23	 	 systolic blood pressure, median (IQR)	120 (110-135)	125 (110-150)	0.32	 	 white cell count (x10-9/L), median (IQR)	7.4 (5.4-9.3)	7.9 (4.7-14.1)	0.65	 	 lymphocyte count (x10-9/L), median (IQR)	1.3 (0.9-1.7)	1.0 (0.7-1.8)	0.88	 	 haemoglobin (g/dL), median (IQR)	12.6 (10.4-14.1)	11.8 (10.5-13.3)	0.28	 	 platelet count (x10-9/L), median (IQR)	204 (165-297)	239 (160-322)	0.82	 	 serum creatinine (mg/dL), median (IQR)	1.1 (0.9-1.4)	1.2 (1.0-1.4)	0.58	 	 AST (U/L), median (IQR)	26 (22-38)	36 (25-60)	0.04	 	 ALT (U/L), median (IQR)	20 (15-30)	28 (14-43)	0.13	 	\nSOF/DCV, sofosbuvir/daclatasvir; RBV, ribavirin.\nThe minimum hospital stay for patients who survived was 3 days and the maximum 19 days. The median time to hospital discharge was 6 days in the sofosbuvir/daclatasvir arm and 11 days in the ribavirin arm (Table 2). Figure 2 presents the cumulative probability of being discharged from hospital alive for the two trial arms. This shows, rather clearly, the more rapid recovery of patients dosed with sofosbuvir/daclatasvir together with a significantly higher survival probability (log rank P &lt; 0.01). Results remained significant after adjustment for baseline characteristics in the Cox proportional hazards model. \nCumulative probability of being discharged alive for the ribavirin and sofosbuvir/daclatasvir arms.\nClinical outcomes in the intention to treat population\nOutcome	SOF/DCV (n = 35)	RBV (n = 27)	P value	 	Duration of hospital stay, median days (IQR)	5 (5-7)	9 (6-11)	&lt;0.01	 	Recovered, n (%)	33 (94%)	18 (67%)	0.01	 	 time to recovery, median (IQR)	6 (5-8)	11 (9-?a)	&lt;0.01	 	Admitted to ICU, n (%)	6 (17%)	13 (48%)	0.01	 	 days in ICU, median (IQR)	3.5 (2-4)	5 (2-10)	0.24	 	 days in ICU, mean (SD)	3.5 (2.1)	5.6 (4.0)	0.24	 	 relative risk of ICU admission (95% CI)	0.36 (0.16-0.81)	2.8 (1.2-6.4)	0.01	 	Deaths, n (%)	2 (5.7%)	9 (33%)	0.01	 	 relative risk of death (95% CI)	0.17 (0.04-0.73)	5.8 (1.4-25)	0.02	 	\nSOF/DCV, sofosbuvir/daclatasvir; RBV, ribavirin.\nThe 75th percentile was not evaluable.\nThe median duration of hospital stay for all patients was 5 days for the sofosbuvir/daclatasvir group and 9 days for the ribavirin group. The need to admit patients to the ICU was lower in the group taking sofosbuvir/daclatasvir (17%) than the group taking ribavirin (48%). The relative risk of ICU admission for the sofosbuvir/daclatasvir group versus the ribavirin group was 0.36 (95% CI 0.16-0.81, P = 0.014). The median duration for ICU stay was 3.5 days for the sofosbuvir/daclatasvir group and 5 days for the ribavirin group (Table 2).\nThe mortality in the sofosbuvir/daclatasvir group was 2/35 (5.7%) versus 9/27 (33%) for the ribavirin group with a relative risk of death of 0.17 (95% CI 0.04-0.73, P = 0.02) for patients treated with sofosbuvir/daclatasvir versus ribavirin and an NNT for benefit of 3.6 (95% CI 2.1-12.1, P &lt; 0.01).\nAdverse effects\nA total of 30 patients (86%) in the sofosbuvir/daclatasvir group and 27 (100%) in the ribavirin group reported at least one adverse effect (Table 3). The most frequent adverse effects in the ribavirin treatment group were anaemia and gastrointestinal (GI) disorders (including nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, abdominal pain and discomfort, GI bleeding and decreased appetite). In addition, leucopenia was more frequent in the sofosbuvir/daclatasvir group. Even though thrombocytopenia was observed in the sofosbuvir/daclatasvir group, no patient in this group had GI bleeding. Notably, we observed no increase in liver enzymes in the sofosbuvir/daclatasvir group whereas five patients in the ribavirin group had mild increases. \nSummary of adverse events\nEvent	SOF/DCV (n = 35)	RBV (n = 27)	All (n = 62)	 	Any adverse event	30 (86%)	27 (100%)	57 (92%)	 	Lymphopenia	5 (14%)	9 (33%)	14 (23%)	 	Thrombocytopenia	4 (11%)	4 (15%)	8 (13%)	 	Leucopenia	9 (25%)	3 (11%)	12 (19%)	 	Nausea and vomiting	13 (37%)	22 (82%)	35 (56%)	 	Increased AST or ALT	0 (0%)	5 (19%)	5 (8.1%)	 	Abdominal discomfort	9 (26%)	16 (59%)	25 (40%)	 	Diarrhoea	7 (20%)	18 (67%)	25 (40%)	 	Gastritis	5 (14%)	10 (37%)	15 (24%)	 	Anaemia	10 (29%)	14 (52%)	24 (38%)	 	Rash	0 (0%)	1 (3.7%)	1 (1.6%)	 	Leucocytosis	3 (8.5%)	7 (26%)	10 (16%)	 	Decreased appetite	13 (37%)	10 (37%)	23 (37%)	 	Prolonged QT interval	1 (2.8%)	0 (0%)	1 (1.6%)	 	Sleep disorders	7 (20%)	5 (19%)	12 (19%)	 	GI bleeding	0 (0%)	16 (59%)	16 (26%)	 	Acute kidney injury	2 (5.7%)	6 (22%)	8 (13%)	 	Shock	2 (5.7%)	9 (33%)	11 (17%)	 	Sepsis	0 (0%)	5 (19%)	5 (8.1%)	 	Stevens-Johnson syndrome	0 (0%)	1 (3.7%)	1 (1.6%)	 	Haematuria	1 (2.8%)	0 (0%)	1 (1.6%)	 	Diffuse intravascular coagulation	0 (0%)	2 (7.4%)	3 (4.8%)	 	\nSOF/DCV, sofosbuvir/daclatasvir; RBV, ribavirin.\nFive patients in the ribavirin group developed sepsis, of whom three survived. One case of severe Stevens-Johnson syndrome was observed in the ribavirin group. The study medication was discontinued and the patient survived. Except for this case, none of the observed adverse effects demanded discontinuation of study medications.\nPatients were followed daily by telephone for 21 days after hospital discharge. There was no report of COVID-related complications or re-admission.\nDiscussion\nIn this open-label trial, the effects of sofosbuvir/daclatasvir and ribavirin in patients with severe COVID-19 were measured. In the group receiving sofosbuvir/daclatasvir, duration in hospital, duration in ICU and mortality rate were significantly lower when compared with the ribavirin group. The time required before observing clinical improvement was significantly less in patients treated with sofosbuvir/daclatasvir, and the side effects of the medication, such as GI bleeding and anaemia, were lower than in the group receiving ribavirin.\nSofosbuvir as a monotherapy is no longer available in Iran so, due to the urgency of COVID-19 and the potential efficacy of daclatasvir, it was decided to use the available fixed-dose formulation of sofosbuvir/daclatasvir. As a result, it was not possible to investigate whether sofosbuvir or daclatasvir was active alone. Our results may reflect the impact of one molecule only or both in combination, although according to the current literature we believe both could be responsible for the effects we have seen. We are aware of other clinical trials in Iran using sofosbuvir/interferon, sofosbuvir/velpatasvir and sofosbuvir/ledipasvir and these may shed light on which molecule(s) appear to be active.\nWith any small trial, the outcome of a single patient can impact the results. For example, in the two deaths observed with sofosbuvir/daclatasvir one patient was 74 and the other 96 years old. It would not be unreasonable to argue that this 96-year-old patient might well have died, regardless of which treatment was offered. With so few deaths in the sofosbuvir/daclatasvir group, no reasonable comparisons can be made other than to note the youngest patient who died in the ribavirin group was 54, the oldest 84, and the median 71.\nSince there is some evidence that ribavirin can help in COVID-19, one arm of our study received ribavirin. It is well known that high doses of ribavirin have many adverse effects which might complicate an advanced case of COVID-19, especially in an ICU setting where impaired renal function is frequently an issue. For instance, anaemia, a well-known adverse effect of ribavirin, was observed in 52% of our ribavirin group versus 29% in sofosbuvir/daclatasvir. On the other hand, the safety of sofosbuvir/daclatasvir is well proven, even in advanced cases of renal failure. So both the possible effectiveness of ribavirin against SARS-CoV-2 and the potential increased mortality due to its side effects might have impacted on our results. In the case of benefit from ribavirin, the observed relative advantage of sofosbuvir/daclatasvir would have been diminished. Conversely, the putative success of sofosbuvir/daclatasvir may have been impacted by excess deaths due to adverse effects of ribavirin. The observation that the relative risk of ICU admission was 0.36 for the sofosbuvir/daclatasvir group versus ribavirin could be possibly explained by ribavirin conferring excess risk. That said, the long half-life of ribavirin (12 days), particularly with respect to the treatment duration and the knowledge that steady-state does not occur for five half-lives, suggests it could equally well be argued that the outcome occurred well before steady-state, and perhaps even before clinically relevant blood levels of ribavirin were reached.\nOur study did not have an arm receiving only lopinavir/ritonavir. But the study by Cao et al. reported a mortality of 19.2% among hospitalized adults treated with this combination. Although a direct comparison is not possible, the mortality in our sofosbuvir/daclatasvir group with roughly similar subjects was much lower at 5.7%. Hence, we recommend that sofosbuvir/daclatasvir should be compared with a placebo in a fully blinded and randomized study with a large sample size in order to accurately determine whether the benefits suggested by this pilot study can be duplicated elsewhere. It would also appear worthwhile to investigate if sofosbuvir or daclatasvir are both active, or if it is only one of these drugs that is active.\nSeveral antiviral drugs are being evaluated for the treatment of COVID-19 infection. Remdesivir has shown clinical benefits in some randomized trials, but the results are not consistent. In addition, remdesivir needs to be given by intravenous infusion and supplies are limited. Favipiravir has shown antiviral effects and trends for improved clinical recovery in pilot studies, but these results need to be confirmed in larger randomized trials.\nIn a recent in vitro study daclatasvir consistently inhibited the production of infectious SARS-CoV-2 virus particles in Vero cells, in the hepatoma cell line HuH-7 and in type II pneumocytes, with EC50 of 0.8, 0.6 and 1.1 muM, respectively. The antiviral effects of sofosbuvir were seen only at high drug concentrations in this study. It is not clear whether these concentrations can be achieved during standard dosing.\nIf sofosbuvir/daclatasvir was proven to be effective in larger randomized clinical trials, this treatment would be cheap to provide and the drug supplies are widely available in many countries for the treatment of hepatitis C. The safety profile of sofosbuvir/daclatasvir has been well described from 12 to 24 weeks of treatment for hepatitis C. In future studies, it would be worth checking whether the sofosbuvir needs to be included in this combination. It is possible that daclatasvir is the only active antiviral at standard doses. In addition, the antiviral effects of daclatasvir might be improved by more frequent dosing (for example three times per day).\nThe inability to perform a fully randomized and blinded study due to the urgency of the global situation was a significant shortcoming, although the baseline characteristics of the two groups (Table 1) indicate that patients were reasonably well distributed. Only having ribavirin-treated patients as controls leaves open the possibility that the higher mortality rate seen in this group was a function of ribavirin use, and that without its use the mortality in this group may have been lower. On the other hand, ribavirin might have had a positive effect on COVID-19 and thus have diminished the beneficial effect we observed with sofosbuvir/daclatasvir. In either case, a study with a non-ribavirin arm is required.\nIn this open-label study, treatment of patients with severe COVID-19 with sofosbuvir/daclatasvir was significantly more effective than ribavirin through improved clinical symptoms, lower mortality rates, a shorter duration of both ICU and hospital stays, and fewer side effects. These preliminary results need to be confirmed in larger double-blind, randomized trials for sofosbuvir/daclatasvir to be approved for the worldwide treatment of COVID-19 infection.\nFunding\nFunded by Abadan Faculty of Medical Sciences, Abadan, Iran.\nTransparency declarations\nNone to declare.\nAuthor contributions\nS.

on COVID-19 have been published to date.\n\n\nMethods\nWe performed a systematic literature review with meta-analysis, using three databases to assess clinical, laboratory, imaging features, and outcomes of COVID-19 confirmed cases.\n\n Observational studies and also case reports, were included, and analyzed separately.\n\n We performed a random-effects model meta-analysis to calculate pooled prevalences and 95% confidence intervals (95%CI).\n\n\nResults\n660 articles were retrieved for the time frame (1/1/2020-2/23/2020).\n\n After screening, 27 articles were selected for full-text

Demographic, clinical, treatment, and laboratory data, including serial samples for viral RNA detection, were extracted from electronic medical records and compared between survivors and

serine protease (MASP)2, in the microvasculature, consistent with sustained, systemic activation of the complement pathways.\n The purpuric skin lesions similarly showed a pauci-inflammatory thrombogenic vasculopathy, with deposition of C5b-9 and C4d in both grossly involved and normally-appearing skin.\n In addition, there was co-localization of COVID-19 spike glycoproteins with C4d and C5b-9 in the interalveolar septa and the cutaneous microvasculature of 2 cases examined.\n In conclusion, at least a subset of sustained, severe COVID-19 may define a type of catastrophic microvascular injury syndrome mediated by activation of complement pathways and an associated procoagulant state.\n It provides a foundation for further exploration of the pathophysiologic importance of complement in COVID-19, and could suggest targets for specific intervention.\n","id":"PMC7158248","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Elsevier

(SARS) is a new human infectious disease with significant morbidity and mortality.\n The disease has been shown to be associated with a new coronavirus (SARS?CoV).\n The clinical and epidemiological aspects of SARS have been described.\n Moreover, the viral genome of SARS?CoV has been fully sequenced.\n However, much of the biological behaviour of the virus is not known and data on the tissue and cellular tropism of SARS?CoV are limited.\n In this study, six fatal cases of SARS were investigated for the tissue and cellular tropism of SARS?CoV using an in?situ hybridization (ISH) technique.\n Among all the tissues studied, positive signals were seen in pneumocytes in the lungs and surface enterocytes in the small bowel.\n Infected pneumocytes were further confirmed by immunofluorescence–fluorescence in?situ hybridization (FISH) analysis.\n These results provide important information concerning the tissue tropism of SARS?CoV, which is distinct from previously identified human coronaviruses, and suggest the possible involvement of novel receptors in this infection.\n Whereas the lung pathology was dominated by diffuse alveolar damage, the gut was relatively intact.\n These findings indicated that tissue responses to SARS?CoV infection are distinct in different organs.\n Copyright © 2004 John Wiley &amp; Sons,

respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is an emerging coronavirus that has resulted in nearly 1,000,000 laboratory-confirmed cases including over 50,000 deaths.\n\n Although SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV share a number of common clinical manifestations, SARS-CoV-2 appears to be highly efficient in person-to-person transmission and frequently cause asymptomatic infections.\n\n However, the underlying mechanism that confers these viral characteristics on high transmissibility and asymptomatic infection remain incompletely understood.\n\n\nMethods\nWe comprehensively investigated the replication, cell tropism, and immune activation profile of SARS-CoV-2 infection in human lung tissues with SARS-CoV included as a comparison.\n\n\nResults\nSARS-CoV-2 infected and replicated in human lung tissues more efficiently than that of SARS-CoV.\n\n Within the 48-hour interval, SARS-CoV-2 generated 3.20 folds more infectious virus particles than that of SARS-CoV from the infected lung tissues (P&lt;0.024).\n\n SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV were similar in cell tropism, with both targeting types I and II pneumocytes, and alveolar macrophages.\n\n Importantly, despite the more efficient virus replication, SARS-CoV-2 did not significantly induce types I, II, or III interferons in the infected human lung tissues.\n\n In addition, while SARS-CoV infection upregulated the expression of 11 out of 13 (84.62%) representative pro-inflammatory cytokines/chemokines, SARS-CoV-2 infection only upregulated 5 of these 13 (38.46%) key inflammatory mediators despite replicating more efficiently.\n\n\nConclusions\nOur study provided the first quantitative data on the comparative replication capacity and immune activation profile of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV infection in human lung tissues.\n\n Our results provided important insights on the pathogenesis, high transmissibility, and asymptomatic infection of

Ara-C and other arabinose-derived nucleoside analogues in the 1960's.\n A future paper will review more recent developments, focusing especially on more complex modifications, particularly those involving multiple changes to the nucleoside scaffold.\n We hope that these articles will help virologists and others outside the field of medicinal chemistry to understand why certain drugs were successfully developed, while the majority of candidate compounds encountered barriers due to low-yielding synthetic routes, toxicity or other problems that led to their

are available.\n The CoV nsp14 exoribonuclease (ExoN) has complicated development of antiviral nucleosides due to its proofreading activity.\n We recently reported that the nucleoside analogue GS-5734 (remdesivir) potently inhibits human and zoonotic CoVs in vitro and in a severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) mouse model.\n However, studies with GS-5734 have not reported resistance associated with GS-5734, nor do we understand the action of GS-5734 in wild-type (WT) proofreading CoVs.\n Here, we show that GS-5734 inhibits murine hepatitis virus (MHV) with similar 50% effective concentration values (EC50) as SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV).\n Passage of WT MHV in the presence of the GS-5734 parent nucleoside selected two mutations in the nsp12 polymerase at residues conserved across all CoVs that conferred up to 5.6-fold resistance to GS-5734, as determined by EC50.\n The resistant viruses were unable to compete with WT in direct coinfection passage in the absence of GS-5734. Introduction of the MHV resistance mutations into SARS-CoV resulted in the same in vitro resistance phenotype and attenuated SARS-CoV pathogenesis in a mouse model.\n Finally, we demonstrate that an MHV mutant lacking ExoN proofreading was significantly more sensitive to GS-5734. Combined, the results indicate that GS-5734 interferes with the nsp12 polymerase even in the setting of intact ExoN proofreading activity and that resistance can be overcome with increased, nontoxic concentrations of GS-5734, further supporting the development of GS-5734 as a broad-spectrum therapeutic to protect against contemporary and emerging

Investigational Agent GS-5734 for the Treatment of Ebola, MERS Coronavirus and Other Pathogenic Viral Infections with High Outbreak Potential","abstract":"Background\nRecent viral outbreaks with significant mortality such as Ebola virus (EBOV), SARS-coronavirus (CoV), and MERS-CoV reinforced the need for effective antiviral therapeutics to control future epidemics.\n\n GS-5734 is a novel nucleotide analog prodrug in the development for treatment of EBOV.\n\n\nMethod\nAntiviral activity of GS-5734 has been established in vitro against a wide range of pathogenic RNA virus families, including filoviruses, coronaviruses, and paramyxoviruses (EC50 = 37 to 200 nM) (Warren et al.\n\n, Nature 2016; Sheahan et al.\n\n, Sci Transl Med 2017; Lo et al.\n\n, Sci Rep 2017).\n\n Herein, we describe the in vivo translation of the broad-spectrum activity of GS-5734 in relevant animal disease models for Ebola, Marburg, MERS-CoV, and Nipah.\n\n\nResult\nTherapeutic efficacy against multiple filoviruses with 80–100% survival was observed in rhesus monkeys infected with lethal doses of EBOV (Kikwit/1995 or Makona/2014) or Marburg virus and treated with once daily intravenous (IV) administration of 5 to 10 mg/kg GS-5734 beginning 3 to 5 days post-infection (p.\n\ni.\n\n).\n\n In all rhesus monkey filovirus infection models, GS-5734 significantly reduced systemic viremia and ameliorated severe clinical disease signs and anatomic pathology.\n\n In mice infected with MERS-CoV, twice daily subcutaneous administration of 25 mg/kg GS-5734 beginning 1 day p.\n\ni.\n\n significantly reduced lung viral load and improved respiratory function.\n\n In rhesus monkeys, once-daily IV administration of 5 mg/kg GS-5734 initiated 1 day prior to MERS-CoV infection reduced lung viral load, improved clinical disease signs, and ameliorated severe lung pathology.\n\n Finally, in African green monkeys infected with a lethal dose of Nipah virus therapeutic once-daily IV administration of 10 mg/kg GS-5734, starting 1 day p.\n\ni.\n\n resulted in 100% survival to at least day 35 without any major respiratory or CNS symptoms.\n\n\nConclusion\nGS-5734 is currently being tested in a phase 2 study in male Ebola survivors with persistent viral RNA in semen.\n\n Lyophilized drug formulation has been developed that can be administered to humans via a 30-minutes IV infusion and does not require cold chain storage.\n\n Together, these results support further development of GS-5734 as a broad-spectrum antiviral to treat viral infections with high mortality and significant outbreak potential.\n\n\nDisclosures\n\nR.\n\n Jordan, Gilead: Employee, Salary.\n\n J.\n\n Feng, Gilead:

2019 (COVID-19) are urgently needed to control this current pandemic, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).\n Replication of SARS-CoV-2 depends on the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), which is the likely target of the investigational nucleotide analogue remdesivir (RDV).\n RDV shows broad-spectrum antiviral activity against RNA viruses, and previous studies with RdRps from Ebola virus and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) have revealed that delayed chain termination is RDV's plausible mechanism of action.\n Here, we expressed and purified active SARS-CoV-2 RdRp composed of the nonstructural proteins nsp8 and nsp12. Enzyme kinetics indicated that this RdRp efficiently incorporates the active triphosphate form of RDV (RDV-TP) into RNA.\n Incorporation of RDV-TP at position i caused termination of RNA synthesis at position i+3. We obtained almost identical results with SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 RdRps.\n A unique property of RDV-TP is its high selectivity over incorporation of its natural nucleotide counterpart ATP.\n In this regard, the triphosphate forms of 2?-C-methylated compounds, including sofosbuvir, approved for the management of hepatitis C virus infection, and the broad-acting antivirals favipiravir and ribavirin, exhibited significant deficits.\n Furthermore, we provide evidence for the target specificity of RDV, as RDV-TP was less efficiently incorporated by the distantly related Lassa virus RdRp, and termination of RNA synthesis was not observed.\n These results collectively provide a unifying, refined mechanism of RDV-mediated RNA synthesis inhibition in coronaviruses and define this nucleotide analogue as a direct-acting antiviral.\n","id":"PMC7242698","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular

Remdesivir","abstract":"Remdesivir (GS-5734) is a 1?-cyano-substituted adenosine nucleotide analogue prodrug that shows broad-spectrum antiviral activity against several RNA viruses.\n This compound is currently under clinical development for the treatment of Ebola virus disease (EVD).\n While antiviral effects have been demonstrated in cell culture and in non-human primates, the mechanism of action of Ebola virus (EBOV) inhibition for remdesivir remains to be fully elucidated.\n The EBOV RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) complex was recently expressed and purified, enabling biochemical studies with the relevant triphosphate (TP) form of remdesivir and its presumptive target.\n In this study, we confirmed that remdesivir-TP is able to compete for incorporation with adenosine triphosphate (ATP).\n Enzyme kinetics revealed that EBOV RdRp and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) RdRp incorporate ATP and remdesivir-TP with similar efficiencies.\n The selectivity of ATP against remdesivir-TP is ~4 for EBOV RdRp and ~3 for RSV RdRp.\n In contrast, purified human mitochondrial RNA polymerase (h-mtRNAP) effectively discriminates against remdesivir-TP with a selectivity value of ~500-fold.\n For EBOV RdRp, the incorporated inhibitor at position i does not affect the ensuing nucleotide incorporation event at position i+1. For RSV RdRp, we measured a ~6-fold inhibition at position i+1 although RNA synthesis was not terminated.\n Chain termination was in both cases delayed and was seen predominantly at position i+5. This pattern is specific to remdesivir-TP and its 1?-cyano modification.\n Compounds with modifications at the 2?-position show different patterns of inhibition.\n While 2?-C-methyl-ATP is not incorporated, ara-ATP acts as a non-obligate chain terminator and prevents nucleotide incorporation at position i+1. Taken together, our biochemical data indicate that the major contribution to EBOV RNA synthesis inhibition by remdesivir can be ascribed to delayed chain termination.\n The long distance of five residues between the incorporated nucleotide analogue and its inhibitory effect warrant further investigation.\n

of Mitochondrial RNA Polymerase in the Toxicity of Nucleotide Inhibitors of Hepatitis C Virus","abstract":"Toxicity has emerged during the clinical development of many but not all nucleotide inhibitors (NI) of hepatitis C virus (HCV).\n To better understand the mechanism for adverse events, clinically relevant HCV NI were characterized in biochemical and cellular assays, including assays of decreased viability in multiple cell lines and primary cells, interaction with human DNA and RNA polymerases, and inhibition of mitochondrial protein synthesis and respiration.\n NI that were incorporated by the mitochondrial RNA polymerase (PolRMT) inhibited mitochondrial protein synthesis and showed a corresponding decrease in mitochondrial oxygen consumption in cells.\n The nucleoside released by the prodrug balapiravir (R1626), 4?-azido cytidine, was a highly selective inhibitor of mitochondrial RNA transcription.\n The nucleotide prodrug of 2?-C-methyl guanosine, BMS-986094, showed a primary effect on mitochondrial function at submicromolar concentrations, followed by general cytotoxicity.\n In contrast, NI containing multiple ribose modifications, including the active forms of mericitabine and sofosbuvir, were poor substrates for PolRMT and did not show mitochondrial toxicity in cells.\n In general, these studies identified the prostate cell line PC-3 as more than an order of magnitude more sensitive to mitochondrial toxicity than the commonly used HepG2 cells.\n In conclusion, analogous to the role of mitochondrial DNA polymerase gamma in toxicity caused by some 2?-deoxynucleotide analogs, there is an association between HCV NI that interact with PolRMT and the observation of adverse events.\n More broadly applied, the sensitive methods for detecting mitochondrial toxicity described here may help in the identification of mitochondrial toxicity prior to clinical testing.\n","id":"PMC4750701","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"American

synthesis that are mediated by the viral replicase, a huge protein complex encoded by the 20-kb replicase gene.\n The replicase complex is believed to be comprised of up to 16 viral subunits and a number of cellular proteins.\n Besides RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, RNA helicase, and protease activities, which are common to RNA viruses, the coronavirus replicase was recently predicted to employ a variety of RNA processing enzymes that are not (or extremely rarely) found in other RNA viruses and include putative sequence-specific endoribonuclease, 3?-to-5? exoribonuclease, 2?-O-ribose methyltransferase, ADP ribose 1?-phosphatase and, in a subset of group 2 coronaviruses, cyclic phosphodiesterase activities.\n This chapter reviews (1) the organization of the coronavirus replicase

helicase, and the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, and (4) the subcellular localization of coronavirus proteins involved in RNA synthesis.\n Although many molecular details of the coronavirus life cycle

synthetic mechanisms employed by diverse families of RNA viruses","abstract":"RNA viruses are ubiquitous in nature, infecting every known organism on the planet.\n These viruses can also be notorious human pathogens with significant medical and economic burdens.\n Central to the lifecycle of an RNA virus is the synthesis of new RNA molecules, a process that is mediated by specialized virally encoded enzymes called RNA?dependent RNA polymerases (RdRps).\n RdRps directly catalyze phosphodiester bond formation between nucleoside triphosphates in an RNA?templated manner.\n These enzymes are strikingly conserved in their structural and functional features, even among diverse RNA viruses belonging to different families.\n During host cell infection, the activities of viral RdRps are often regulated by viral cofactor proteins.\n Cofactors can modulate the type and timing of RNA synthesis by directly engaging the RdRp and/or by indirectly affecting its capacity to recognize template RNA.\n High?resolution structures of RdRps as apoenzymes, bound to RNA templates, in the midst of catalysis, and/or interacting with regulatory cofactor proteins, have dramatically increased our understanding of viral RNA synthetic mechanisms.\n Combined with elegant biochemical studies, such structures are providing a scientific platform for the rational design of antiviral agents aimed at preventing and treating RNA virus?induced diseases.\n WIREs RNA 2013, 4:351–367. doi: 10.1002/wrna.\n1164","id":"PMC7169773","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"John Wiley &amp; Sons,

coronavirus 2 (SARS?CoV?2) has become a global health concern and pose a serious threat to humanity.\n There is an urgent need for developing therapeutic drugs and (or) biologics to prevent the spread of the virus.\n The life cycle of SARS?CoV?2 shows that the virus enters host cells by first binding to angiotensin?converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) through its spike protein receptor?binding domain (RBD).\n Therefore, blocking the binding between of ACE2 and SARS?CoV?2 RBD can inhibit the virus infection in the host cells.\n In this study, by grafting the complementarity?determining regions (CDRs) of developed SARS?CoV, MERS?CoVs specific neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) include monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) as well as SARS?CoV?2 mAbs onto a known stable nanobody (Nb) scaffold, and a total of 16 Nbs sequences were designed.\n Five Nbs, namely CS01, CS02, CS03, CS10, and CS16, were selected based on the free energy landscape of protein docking verified by the recently reported Nb?RBD cocrystal structures.\n CS01, CS02, and CS03 occupied the ACE2 binding site of RBD, while CS10 and CS16 were proposed to inhibit the interaction between RBD and ACE2 through an allosteric mechanism.\n Based on the structures of the five Nbs in complex with RBD, seven brand?new Nbs with enhanced binding affinities (CS02_RD01, CS03_RD01, CS03_RD02, CS03_RD03, CS03_RD04, CS16_RD01, and CS16_RD02) were generated by redesign of residues on the interface of the five Nbs contact with SARS?CoV?2 RBD.\n In addition, the identified “hot spots” on the interface of each complex provide useful information to understand the binding mechanism of designed Nbs to SARS?CoV?2 RBD.\n In sum, the predicted stabilities and high binding affinities of the 11 (re)designed Nbs indicating the potential of the developed

contagious and has an overall mortality rate of 6.35% as of May 26, 2020. There is no vaccine or antiviral available for SARS-CoV-2. In this study, we report our discovery of inhibitors targeting the SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro).\n Using the FRET-based enzymatic assay, several inhibitors including boceprevir, GC-376, and calpain inhibitors II, and XII were identified to have potent activity with single-digit to submicromolar IC50 values in the enzymatic assay.\n The mechanism of action of the hits was further characterized using enzyme kinetic studies, thermal shift binding assays, and native mass spectrometry.\n Significantly, four compounds (boceprevir, GC-376, calpain inhibitors II and XII) inhibit SARS-CoV-2 viral replication in cell culture with EC50 values ranging from 0.49 to 3.37?µM.\n Notably, boceprevir, calpain inhibitors II and XII represent novel chemotypes that are distinct from known substrate-based peptidomimetic Mpro inhibitors.\n A complex crystal structure of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro with GC-376, determined at 2.15?Å resolution with three protomers per asymmetric unit, revealed two unique binding configurations, shedding light on the molecular interactions and protein conformational flexibility underlying substrate and inhibitor binding by Mpro.\n Overall, the compounds identified herein

there is an urgent need to identify therapeutics that are effective against COVID-19 before vaccines are available.\n Since the current rate of SARS-CoV-2 knowledge acquisition via traditional research methods is not sufficient to match the rapid spread of the virus, novel strategies of drug discovery for SARS-CoV-2 infection are required.\n Structure-based virtual screening for example relies primarily on docking scores and does not take the importance of key residues into consideration, which may lead to a significantly higher incidence rate of false-positive results.\n Our novel in silico approach, which overcomes these limitations, can be utilized to quickly evaluate FDA-approved drugs for repurposing and combination, as well as designing new chemical agents with therapeutic potential for COVID-19. As a result, anti-HIV or antiviral drugs (lopinavir, tenofovir disoproxil, fosamprenavir and ganciclovir), antiflu drugs (peramivir and zanamivir) and an anti-HCV drug (sofosbuvir) are predicted to bind to 3CLPro in SARS-CoV-2 with therapeutic potential for COVID-19 infection by our new protocol.\n In addition, we also propose three antidiabetic drugs (acarbose, glyburide and tolazamide) for the potential treatment of COVID-19. Finally, we apply our new virus chemogenomics knowledgebase platform with the integrated machine-learning computing algorithms to identify the potential drug combinations (e.\ng.\n remdesivir+chloroquine), which are congruent with ongoing clinical trials.\n In addition, another 10 compounds from CAS COVID-19 antiviral candidate compounds dataset are also suggested by Molecular Complex Characterizing System with potential treatment for COVID-19. Our work provides a novel strategy for the repurposing and combinations of drugs in the market and for prediction of chemical candidates with anti-COVID-19

agents has also been challenging, primarily due to the lack of efficient cell culture and animal models for all HCV genotypes, as well as the large genetic diversity between HCV strains.\n On the other hand, the use of interferon-?-based treatments in combination with the guanosine analogue, ribavirin, achieved limited success, and widespread use of these therapies has been hampered by prevalent side effects.\n For more than a decade, the HCV RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) has been targeted for antiviral development.\n Direct acting antivirals (DAA) have been identified which bind to one of at least six RdRp inhibitor-binding sites, and are now becoming a mainstay of highly effective and well tolerated antiviral treatment for HCV infection.\n Here we review the different classes of RdRp inhibitors and their mode of action against HCV.\n Furthermore, the mechanism of antiviral resistance to each class is described, including naturally occurring resistance-associated

viral replication.\n However, its role in replication has not been defined.\n Using an in vitro biochemical assay, we detected a stimulatory effect of NS5A on the NS5B replication reaction with minimal natural templates.\n NS5A stimulates replication by NS5B on two templates derived from the 3’ end of the RNA genome (4 fold ± 1.3 fold).\n A pre-incubation step with the two proteins prior to the replication reaction and substoichiometric levels of NS5A are required for detecting stimulation.\n With a template derived from the 3’end complementary to the RNA genome (the negative strand) no stimulation was observed.\n Furthermore, with a synthetic template that allows studying different phases of replication, NS5A stimulates NS5B during elongation.\n These findings suggest that NS5A stimulates NS5B during synthesis of the complementary (i.\ne.\n, negative) strand of the RNA genome.\n","id":"PMC2701273","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Bentham

For RSV RdRp, we measured a ~6-fold inhibition at position i+1 although RNA synthesis was not terminated.\n Chain termination was in both cases delayed and was seen predominantly at position i+5. This pattern is specific to remdesivir-TP and its 1?-cyano modification.\n Compounds with modifications at the 2?-position show different patterns of inhibition.\n While 2?-C-methyl-ATP is not incorporated, ara-ATP acts as a non-obligate chain terminator and prevents nucleotide incorporation at position i+1. Taken together, our biochemical data indicate that the major contribution to EBOV RNA synthesis inhibition by remdesivir can be ascribed to delayed chain termination.\n The long distance of five

However, their clinical applications have been limited by off target effects.\n Development of antiviral ribonucleosides for treatment of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection has been hampered by appearance of toxicity during clinical trials that evaded detection during preclinical studies.\n It is well established that the human mitochondrial DNA polymerase is an off target for

nsp14 exoribonuclease (ExoN) has complicated development of antiviral nucleosides due to its proofreading activity.\n We recently reported that the nucleoside analogue GS-5734 (remdesivir) potently inhibits human and zoonotic CoVs in vitro and in a severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) mouse model.\n However, studies with GS-5734 have not reported resistance associated with GS-5734, nor do we understand the action of GS-5734 in wild-type (WT) proofreading CoVs.\n Here, we show that GS-5734 inhibits murine hepatitis virus (MHV) with similar 50% effective concentration values (EC50) as SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV).\n Passage of WT MHV in the presence of the GS-5734 parent nucleoside selected two mutations in the nsp12 polymerase at residues conserved across all CoVs that conferred up to 5.6-fold resistance to GS-5734, as determined by EC50.\n The resistant viruses were unable to compete with WT in direct coinfection passage in the absence of GS-5734. Introduction of the MHV resistance mutations into SARS-CoV resulted in the same in vitro resistance phenotype and attenuated SARS-CoV pathogenesis in a mouse model.\n Finally, we demonstrate that an MHV mutant lacking ExoN proofreading was significantly more sensitive to GS-5734. Combined, the results indicate that GS-5734 interferes with the nsp12 polymerase even in the setting of intact ExoN proofreading activity and that resistance can be overcome with increased, nontoxic concentrations of GS-5734, further supporting the development of GS-5734 as a broad-spectrum therapeutic to protect against contemporary and emerging CoVs.\n","id":"PMC5844999","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"American Society for Microbiology","authors":[{"firstname":"Maria L.","surname":"Agostini","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Erica L.","surname":"Andres","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Amy C.","surname":"Sims","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Rachel L.","surname":"Graham","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Timothy P.","surname":"Sheahan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xiaotao","surname":"Lu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Everett Clinton","surname":"Smith","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"James Brett","surname":"Case","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Joy Y.","surname":"Feng","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Robert","surname":"Jordan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Adrian S.","surname":"Ray","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Tomas","surname":"Cihlar","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Dustin","surname":"Siegel","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Richard L.","surname":"Mackman","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Michael O.","surname":"Clarke","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ralph S.","surname":"Baric","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Mark R.","surname":"Denison","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Kanta","surname":"Subbarao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Kanta","surname":"Subbarao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1101/2020.03.12.989186","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Nucleotide analogues as inhibitors of SARS-CoV polymerase","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1021/acs.jproteome.0c00392","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Nucleotide Analogues\nas Inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2\nPolymerase, a Key Drug Target for COVID-19","abstract":"content-type='toc-graphic'>\n\n","id":"PMC7640960","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"American Chemical\nSociety","authors":[{"firstname":"Minchen","surname":"Chien","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Thomas K.","surname":"Anderson","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Steffen","surname":"Jockusch","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Chuanjuan","surname":"Tao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xiaoxu","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Shiv","surname":"Kumar","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"James J.","surname":"Russo","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Robert N.","surname":"Kirchdoerfer","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jingyue","surname":"Ju","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1016/j.antiviral.2020.104857","date":"2020-06-12","title":"A library of nucleotide analogues terminate RNA synthesis catalyzed by polymerases of coronaviruses that cause SARS and COVID-19","abstract":"SARS-CoV-2, a member of the coronavirus family, is responsible for the current COVID-19 worldwide pandemic.\n We previously demonstrated that five nucleotide analogues inhibit the SARS-CoV-2 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), including the active triphosphate forms of Sofosbuvir, Alovudine, Zidovudine, Tenofovir alafenamide and Emtricitabine.\n We report here the evaluation of a library of nucleoside triphosphate analogues with a variety of structural and chemical features as inhibitors of the RdRps of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. These features include modifications on the sugar (2? or 3? modifications, carbocyclic, acyclic, or dideoxynucleotides) or on the base.\n The goal is to identify nucleotide analogues that not only terminate RNA synthesis catalyzed by these coronavirus RdRps, but also have the potential to resist the viruses' exonuclease activity.\n We examined these nucleotide analogues for their ability to be incorporated by the RdRps in the polymerase reaction and to prevent further incorporation.\n While all 11 molecules tested displayed incorporation, 6 exhibited immediate termination of the polymerase reaction (triphosphates of Carbovir, Ganciclovir, Stavudine and Entecavir; 3?-OMe-UTP and Biotin-16-dUTP), 2 showed delayed termination (Cidofovir diphosphate and 2?-OMe-UTP), and 3 did not terminate the polymerase reaction (2?-F-dUTP, 2?–NH2–dUTP and Desthiobiotin-16-UTP).\n The coronaviruses possess an exonuclease that apparently requires a 2?-OH at the 3?-terminus of the growing RNA strand for proofreading.\n In this study, all nucleoside triphosphate analogues evaluated form Watson-Crick-like base pairs.\n The nucleotide analogues demonstrating termination either lack a 2?-OH, have a blocked 2?-OH, or show delayed termination.\n Thus, these nucleotide analogues are of interest for further investigation to evaluate whether they can evade the viral exonuclease activity.\n Prodrugs of five of these nucleotide analogues (Cidofovir, Abacavir, Valganciclovir/Ganciclovir, Stavudine and Entecavir) are FDA-approved medications for treatment of other viral infections, and their safety profiles are well established.\n After demonstrating potency in inhibiting viral replication in cell culture, candidate molecules can be rapidly evaluated as potential therapies for

Covid-19","abstract":"Background\nNo therapeutics have yet been proven effective for the treatment of severe illness caused by SARS-CoV-2.\nMethods\nWe conducted a randomized, controlled, open-label trial involving hospitalized adult patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, which causes the respiratory illness Covid-19, and an oxygen saturation (Sao2) of 94% or less while they were breathing ambient air or a ratio of the partial pressure of oxygen (Pao2) to the fraction of inspired oxygen (Fio2) of less than 300 mm Hg.\n\n Patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either lopinavir–ritonavir (400 mg and 100 mg, respectively) twice a day for 14 days, in addition to standard care, or standard care alone.\n\n The primary end point was the time to clinical improvement, defined as the time from randomization to either an improvement of two points on a seven-category ordinal scale or discharge from the hospital, whichever came first.\n\n\nResults\nA total of 199 patients with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection underwent randomization; 99 were assigned to the lopinavir–ritonavir group, and 100 to the standard-care group.\n\n Treatment with lopinavir–ritonavir was not associated with a difference from standard care in the time to clinical improvement (hazard ratio for clinical improvement, 1.24; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.90 to 1.72).\n\n Mortality at 28 days was similar in the lopinavir–ritonavir group and the standard-care group (19.2% vs.\n\n 25.0%; difference, ?5.8 percentage points; 95% CI, ?17.3 to 5.7).\n\n The percentages of patients with detectable viral RNA at various time points were similar.\n\n In a modified intention-to-treat analysis, lopinavir–ritonavir led to a median time to clinical improvement that was shorter by 1 day than that observed with standard care (hazard ratio, 1.39; 95% CI, 1.00 to 1.91).\n\n Gastrointestinal adverse events were more common in the lopinavir–ritonavir group, but serious adverse events were more common in the standard-care group.\n\n Lopinavir–ritonavir treatment was stopped early in 13 patients (13.8%) because of adverse events.\n\n\nConclusions\nIn hospitalized adult patients with severe Covid-19, no benefit was observed with lopinavir–ritonavir treatment beyond standard care.\n\n Future trials in patients with severe illness may help to confirm or exclude the possibility of a treatment benefit.\n\n (Funded by Major Projects of National Science and Technology on New Drug Creation and Development and others; Chinese Clinical Trial Register

compassionate-use basis to patients hospitalized with Covid-19, the illness caused by infection with SARS-CoV-2. Patients were those with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection who had an oxygen saturation of 94% or less while they were breathing ambient air or who were receiving oxygen support.\n\n Patients received a 10-day course of remdesivir, consisting of 200 mg administered intravenously on day 1, followed by 100 mg daily for the remaining 9 days of treatment.\n\n This report is based on data from patients

The primary composite end point was admission to an intensive care unit (ICU), the use of mechanical ventilation, or death.\n\n\nResults\nThe median age of the patients was 47 years; 41.9% of the patients were female.\n\n The primary composite end point occurred in 67 patients (6.1%), including 5.0% who were admitted to the ICU, 2.3% who underwent invasive mechanical ventilation, and 1.4% who died.\n\n Only 1.9% of the patients had a history of direct contact with wildlife.\n\n Among nonresidents of Wuhan, 72.3% had contact with residents of Wuhan, including 31.3% who had visited the city.\n\n The most common symptoms were fever (43.8% on admission and 88.7% during hospitalization) and cough (67.8%).\n\n Diarrhea was uncommon (3.8%).\n\n The median incubation period was 4 days (interquartile range, 2 to 7).\n\n On admission, ground-glass opacity was the most common radiologic finding on chest computed tomography (CT) (56.4%).\n\n No radiographic or CT abnormality was found in 157 of 877 patients (17.9%) with nonsevere disease and in 5 of 173 patients (2.9%) with severe disease.\n\n Lymphocytopenia was present in 83.2% of the patients on

January 2020. We analyzed data on the first 425 confirmed cases in Wuhan to determine the epidemiologic characteristics of NCIP.\n\n\nMethods\nWe collected information on demographic characteristics, exposure history, and illness timelines of laboratory-confirmed cases of NCIP that had been reported by January 22, 2020. We described characteristics of the cases and estimated the key epidemiologic time-delay distributions.\n\n In the early period of exponential growth, we estimated the epidemic doubling time and the basic reproductive number.\n\n\nResults\nAmong the first 425 patients with confirmed NCIP, the median age was 59 years and 56% were male.\n\n The majority of cases (55%) with onset before January 1, 2020, were linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, as compared with 8.6% of the subsequent cases.\n\n The mean incubation period was 5.2 days (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.1 to 7.0), with the 95th percentile of the distribution at 12.5 days.\n\n In its early stages, the epidemic doubled in size every 7.4 days.\n\n With a mean serial interval of 7.5 days (95% CI, 5.3 to 19), the basic reproductive number was estimated to be 2.2 (95% CI, 1.4 to 3.9).\n\n\nConclusions\nOn the basis of this information, there is evidence that human-to-human transmission has occurred among close contacts since the middle of December 2019.

disease.\n\n\nMethods\nid='Par2'>Using an open-label randomized controlled trial, we examined the efficacy of ARB in patients with COVID-19 in a teaching hospital.\n\n One hundred eligible patients with diagnosis of COVID-19 were recruited in the study and assigned randomly to two groups of either hydroxychloroquine followed by KALETRA (Lopinavir/ritonavir) or hydroxychloroquine followed by ARB.\n\n The primary outcome was hospitalization duration and clinical improvement 7?days after admission.\n\n The criteria of improvement were relief of cough, dyspnea, and fever.\n\n Time to relief

The last follow-up date was Feb.\n 26, 2020.

This trial aims to evaluate sofosbuvir and daclatasvir versus standard care for outpatients with mild COVID-19 infection.\nMethods\nThis was a randomized controlled clinical trial in outpatients with mild COVID-19. Patients were randomized into a treatment arm receiving sofosbuvir/daclatasvir plus hydroxychloroquine or a control arm receiving hydroxychloroquine alone. The primary endpoint of the trial was symptom alleviation after 7 days of follow-up. The secondary endpoint of the trial was hospital admission.

Sofosbuvir/daclatasvir significantly reduced the number of patients with fatigue and dyspnoea after 1 month. Larger, well-designed trials are warranted.\nIntroduction\nThe severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and resulting coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) continue to cause serious public health concern. Currently, there are millions of confirmed cases including hundreds of thousands of deaths. However, no treatment so far has demonstrated clear efficacy against COVID-19; therefore, new treatments are urgently needed. Repurposing existing pharmaceuticals is an attractive short-term management strategy for the immediate pandemic. Repurposed pharmaceuticals may be used to treat mild or moderate disease to stop progression toward severe disease and reduce strain on healthcare systems.\nSARS-CoV-2 is a positive-sense RNA virus that requires an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) during replication. Other viral families share similar replication mechanisms and therefore existing antivirals may be repurposed for treatment against SARS-CoV-2. Sofosbuvir and daclatasvir are direct-acting antiviral agents against hepatitis C. Sofosbuvir and daclatasvir have predicted in silico activity against SARS-CoV-2 and therefore are attractive treatment options. In a recent study, sofosbuvir and daclatasvir show in vitro activity against SARS-CoV-2-infected Huh-7 and Calu-3 cells. In that study, daclatasvir also shows activity in Vero 6-infected cells; however, sofosbuvir does not. Reports of neurological complications associated with COVID-19 are increasing. Sofosbuvir has also demonstrated protective activity against SARS-CoV-2-infected brain organoids.\nIn Iran, sofosbuvir/daclatasvir is available as the fixed-dose combination, Sovodak (400/60 mg). Three recently published clinical trials investigating sofosbuvir/daclatasvir in moderate to severe hospitalized patients have shown improved clinical outcomes. In addition to efficacy and safety, a potential treatment option for COVID-19 must be widely available and affordable:the estimated API production cost of generic sofosbuvir/daclatasvir is approximately $5 per 14 day treatment course. The current guideline in Iran recommends conservative management with or without hydroxychloroquine, but sofosbuvir/daclatasvir has yet to be tested in an outpatient setting. We therefore conducted a randomized active-controlled trial to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of adding sofosbuvir/daclatasvir to the routine protocol of COVID-19 outpatients.\nMethods\nStudy design and participants\nThis was a double-blind, randomized parallel-group, active-controlled clinical trial. Patients were recruited from 8 April 2020 to 19 May 2020 from Miandrood Outpatient Medical Clinic in Surak, Mazandaran, Iran. Adults with confirmed CT scan findings for COVID-19, typical COVID-19 clinical symptoms including fever, cough and fatigue, and positive C-reactive protein (CRP) test were evaluated to enter the trial. Exclusion criteria included: oxygen saturation less than 93%, pregnancy, amiodarone use, renal failure and cardiovascular diseases. All patients gave written informed consent for participation in the study.\nRandomization and masking\nPatients were randomly assigned to either sofosbuvir/daclatasvir and hydroxychloroquine or hydroxychloroquine groups through unstratified block randomization with a block size of four. A block randomization list was created using a computer-generated randomization plan. Physician and analyser were blinded and randomization with coding was done by a third person.\nProcedure\nAll patients received standard care according to the national Iranian treatment guidelines. All patients received azithromycin capsules (500 mg for 6 days) with naproxen tablets (500 mg, twice daily for 7 days), as well as 40 mg pantoprazole tablets. The intervention group (sofosbuvir/daclatasvir group) received a single daily oral tablet containing 400 mg sofosbuvir and 60 mg daclatasvir (Sovodak, Rojan Pharma, Tehran, Iran) with hydroxychloroquine (200 mg twice daily) for 7 days, or until death/hospitalization. All patients required a diagnostic CT scan for COVID-19 infection, according to the definition by the Iranian Society of Radiology. The percentage lung involvement by ground glass opacity was recorded. Patients were followed-up at Days 1, 3, 5 and 7 for symptoms such as fever, sore throat, headache, xerostomia, myalgia, cough and olfactory disorder. At Days 1, 3 and 5 patients were followed-up by phone call and at Day 7 by a personal visit. At 30 days from enrolment, patients were followed-up by phone call to monitor fatigue, shortness of breath and anorexia. Patients in both arms were given training regarding adequate rest, quarantine principles and increasing respiratory capacity.\nOutcomes\nThe primary endpoint was symptom alleviation by Day 7. Secondary endpoints included hospital admission and alleviation of symptoms (fatigue, shortness of breath and loss of appetite) after 30 days of follow-up.\nStatistical analysis\nCategorical variables were analysed using Fisher's exact test and continuous variables were compared using Mann-Whitney U-test. A P value was considered statistically significant at the P &lt; 0.05 threshold. Statistical analysis was performed using Stata version 16.0; StataCorp.\nEthics\nThis study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Mazandaran University of Medical Sciences (approval number IR.MAZUMS.REC.1399.017) on 1 April 2020. This trial is registered with the Iranian Registry of Clinical Trials (IRCT20200403046926N1).\nResults\nFrom 8 April 2020 to 19 May 2020, 62 patients were assessed for eligibility and 55 patients were enrolled. Of those enrolled, 27 patients were randomized to the sofosbuvir/daclatasvir group and 28 patients to the control group (Figure 1). The median age of patients was 43 (IQR 37-53), 26 patients (47%) were men versus 29 (53%) women. Twenty-one patients (38%) had underlying conditions (diabetes, hypertension and pulmonary disease). Age, sex and baseline demographics were similar across treatment arms (Table 1).\nCONSORT 2010 flow diagram. HCQ, hydroxychloroquine; SOF/DCV, sofosbuvir/daclatasvir.

The number of patients experiencing any symptoms decreased by Day 7; however, this was not significant. One patient was admitted to hospital in the sofosbuvir/daclatasvir group (4%) versus four in the control (14%), but this difference was non-significant P = 0.352 (Table 2). After one month of follow-up, significantly fewer patients in the sofosbuvir/daclatasvir group reported fatigue compared with the control group (2 versus 16, respectively, P &lt; 0.001). Furthermore, the number of patients with dyspnoea was significantly lower in the sofosbuvir/daclatasvir group compared with control (4 versus 11, respectively, P = 0.035). No patients experienced loss of appetite in the sofosbuvir/daclatasvir group compared with three (12%) patients in the control group, and this difference was non-significant, P = 0.111 (Table 2).\nTreatment response monitoring.

However, sofosbuvir/daclatasvir did not show efficacy in reducing the number of patients who experienced symptoms at Day 7 of follow-up, or the number of hospital admissions compared with the control group.\nIt is reasonable to assume that any efficacy shown in the trial may be attributed to sofosbuvir or daclatasvir. Current evidence suggests that hydroxychloroquine shows little efficacy against COVID-19, which has been removed from the UK RECOVERY Trial amidst potential cardiovascular adverse events. Additionally, the hydroxychloroquine arm of the SOLIDARITY trial was halted and later resumed amidst this uncertainty. Other candidate treatments such as favipiravir and lopinavir/ritonavir have not shown clear clinical benefit. Results from clinical trials investigating remdesivir have been mixed. In a preliminary report, dexamethasone demonstrated improved survival for those who required oxygen or mechanical ventilation; however, no benefit was found in patients with milder disease.\nCurrently, there is no medicine proven to be effective for treating COVID patients in an Outpatient Department (OPD) setting. Remdesivir and dexamethasone show potential benefit for hospitalized, severe patients. However, as an IV drug, remdesivir would be an impractical treatment for mild patients in an OPD setting. It stands to reason that if treatment is initiated earlier in the course of the disease, better results would be obtained. Having an oral treatment for COVID would allow this. There is already some evidence that sofosbuvir/daclatasvir is helpful in hospitalized patients. Treating patients in an outpatient setting has the potential to reduce hospital admissions. It should also be noted that the combination of sofosbuvir/daclatasvir is remarkably safe as proven by years of experience in hepatitis C where patients with advanced cirrhosis and renal failure have been treated for 12 or 24 weeks without significant adverse events.\nThis study has several key limitations. Primarily, assessment of symptom outcomes was not carried out using an objective grading system and therefore results are subject to information bias. More objective measures such as CRP status or lymphocyte count are required to measure the clinical effect of sofosbuvir/daclatasvir. However, viral load tests are restricted for diagnosis only by the Iranian government and cannot be used to measure treatment response. The small sample size of this study is another limitation and, therefore, future studies with larger sample sizes are warranted to reduce the risk of type II error.\nOverall, sofosbuvir/daclatasvir improves fatigue and dyspnoea after 30 days of follow-up. The long-term effects of COVID-19 remain unclear; emerging reports indicate that symptoms such as fatigue and dyspnoea may persist for longer than 2 weeks in mild patients. Larger, well designed trials with longer follow-up times are needed to validate the efficacy of sofosbuvir/daclatasvir in an outpatient setting. Given the small number of outcomes in OPD patients, such a study would require a much larger sample size and should probably be multicentre.\nReferences\nSD1000: high sustained viral response rate in 1361 patients with hepatitis C genotypes 1, 2, 3, and 4 using a low-cost, fixed-dose combination tablet of generic sofosbuvir and daclatasvir: a multicenter, phase III clinical trial\nSofosbuvir as a potential alternative to treat the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic\nPredicting commercially available antiviral drugs that may act on the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) through a drug-target interaction deep learning model\nThe in vitro antiviral activity of the anti-hepatitis C virus (HCV) drugs daclatasvir and sofosbuvir against SARS-CoV-2\nNeurologic manifestations of hospitalized patients with coronavirus disease 2019 in Wuhan, China\nRapid Review Neurological associations of COVID-19\nSofosbuvir protects human brain organoids against SARS-CoV-2\nThe impact of sofosbuvir/daclatasvir or ribavirin in patients with severe COVID-19\nSofosbuvir and daclatasvir compared with standard of care in the treatment of patients admitted to hospital with moderate or severe coronavirus infection (COVID-19): a randomized controlled trial\nEvaluation of the efficacy of sofosbuvir plus daclatasvir in combination with ribavirin for hospitalized COVID-19 patients with moderate disease compared with standard care: a single centre, randomized controlled trial\nMinimum costs to manufacture new treatments for COVID-19\nRadiologic management of COVID-19: preliminary experience of the Iranian Society of Radiology COVID-19 Consultant Group (ISRCC)\nFavipiravir, an antiviral for COVID-19?\nExperimental treatment with favipiravir for COVID-19: an open-label control study\nA trial of lopinavir-ritonavir in adults hospitalized with severe COVID-19\nRemdesivir in adults with severe COVID-19: a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicentre trial\nRemdesivir for 5 or 10 Days in Patients with Severe Covid-19\nRemdesivir for the treatment of Covid-19:preliminary report\nEffect of Dexamethasone in Hospitalized Patients with COVID-19: preliminary Report\nThe combination of sofosbuvir and daclatasvir is effective and safe in treating patients with hepatitis C and severe renal impairment\nThe efficacy of 12 weeks of sofosbuvir, daclatasvir, and ribavirin in treating hepatitis C patients with cirrhosis, genotypes 1 and 3\n","References depth 1":[{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"SD1000: high sustained viral response rate in 1361 patients with hepatitis C genotypes 1, 2, 3, and 4 using a low-cost, fixed-dose combination tablet of generic sofosbuvir and daclatasvir: a multicenter, phase III clinical trial","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[],"References depth 2":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Sofosbuvir as a potential alternative to treat the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[],"References depth 2":[{"doi":"10.1016/j.idc.2019.07.001","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome","abstract":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), emerged from China and rapidly spread worldwide.\n Over 8098 people fell ill and 774 died before the epidemic ended in July 2003.

Although convincing data supporting the proofreading hypothesis have been obtained, from biochemical assays and studies with CoV mutants lacking ExoN functionality, the features of ExoN from most other nidovirus families remain to be characterized.\n Remarkably, viable ExoN knockout mutants were obtained only for two CoVs, mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) and SARS-CoV, whose RNA synthesis and replication kinetics were mildly affected by the lack of ExoN function.\n In several other CoV species, ExoN inactivation was not tolerated, and knockout mutants could not be rescued when launched using a reverse genetics system.\n This suggests that ExoN is also critical for primary viral RNA synthesis, a property that poorly matches the profile of an enzyme that would merely boost long-term replication fidelity.\n In CoVs, ExoN resides in a bifunctional replicase subunit (nsp14) whose C-terminal part has (N7-guanine)-methyltransferase activity.\n The crystal structure of SARS-CoV nsp14 has shed light on the interplay between these two domains, and on nsp14’s interactions with nsp10, a co-factor that strongly enhances ExoN activity in vitro assays.\n Further elucidation of the structure-function relationships of ExoN and its interactions with other (viral and/or host) members of the CoV replication machinery will be key to understanding the enzyme’s role in viral RNA synthesis and pathogenesis, and may contribute to the design of new approaches to combat emerging nidoviruses.\n","id":"PMC6693484","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Frontiers Media S.A.","authors":[{"firstname":"Natacha S.","surname":"Ogando","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Francois","surname":"Ferron","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Etienne","surname":"Decroly","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Bruno","surname":"Canard","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Clara C.","surname":"Posthuma","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Eric J.","surname":"Snijder","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"WHO.

with the metal ions to catalyze the nucleotidyl transfer reaction.\n The recent availability of crystal structures of polymerases of the Orthomyxoviridae and Bunyaviridae families allowed us to make pairwise comparisons of the tertiary structures of polymerases belonging to the four main RNA viral groups, which has led to a phylogenetic tree in which single-stranded negative RNA viral polymerases have been included for the first time.\n This has also allowed us to use a homology-based structural prediction approach to develop a general three-dimensional model of the Ebola virus RNA-dependent RNA polymerase.\n Our model includes several of the conserved structural motifs and residues described in other viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerases that define the catalytic and highly conserved palm subdomain, as well as portions of the fingers and thumb subdomains.\n The results presented here help to understand the current use and apparent success of antivirals, i.\ne.\n Brincidofovir, Lamivudine and Favipiravir, originally aimed at other types of polymerases, to counteract the Ebola virus infection.\n","id":"PMC4634563","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Public Library

viruses.\n Favipiravir was discovered through screening chemical library for anti-viral activity against the influenza virus by Toyama Chemical Co.\n, Ltd.\n Favipiravir undergoes an intracellular phosphoribosylation to be an active form, favipiravir-RTP (favipiravir ribofuranosyl-5?-triphosphate), which is recognized as a substrate by RdRp, and inhibits the RNA polymerase activity.\n Since the catalytic domain of RdRp is conserved among various types of RNA viruses, this mechanism of action underpins a broader spectrum of anti-viral activities of favipiravir.\n Favipiravir is effective against a wide range of types and subtypes of influenza viruses, including strains resistant to existing anti-influenza drugs.\n Of note is that favipiravir shows anti-viral activities against other RNA viruses such as arenaviruses, bunyaviruses and filoviruses, all of which are known to cause fatal hemorrhagic fever.\n These unique anti-viral profiles will make favipiravir a potentially

Susceptibility to the Antiviral Remdesivir (GS-5734) Is Mediated by the Viral Polymerase and the Proofreading Exoribonuclease","abstract":"Emerging coronaviruses (CoVs) cause severe disease in humans, but no approved therapeutics are available.\n The CoV nsp14 exoribonuclease (ExoN) has complicated development of antiviral nucleosides due to its proofreading activity.\n We recently reported that the nucleoside analogue GS-5734 (remdesivir) potently inhibits human and zoonotic CoVs in vitro and in a severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) mouse model.\n However, studies with GS-5734 have not reported resistance associated with GS-5734, nor do we understand the action of GS-5734 in wild-type (WT) proofreading CoVs.\n Here, we show that GS-5734 inhibits murine hepatitis virus (MHV) with similar 50% effective concentration values (EC50) as SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV).\n Passage of WT MHV in the presence of the GS-5734 parent nucleoside selected two mutations in the nsp12 polymerase at residues conserved across all CoVs that conferred up to 5.6-fold resistance to GS-5734, as determined by EC50.\n The resistant viruses were unable to compete with WT in direct coinfection passage in the absence of GS-5734. Introduction of the MHV resistance mutations into SARS-CoV resulted in the same in vitro resistance phenotype and attenuated SARS-CoV pathogenesis in a mouse model.\n Finally, we demonstrate that an MHV mutant lacking ExoN proofreading was significantly more sensitive to GS-5734. Combined, the results indicate that GS-5734 interferes with the nsp12 polymerase even in the setting of intact ExoN proofreading activity and that resistance can be overcome with increased, nontoxic concentrations of GS-5734, further supporting the development of GS-5734 as a broad-spectrum therapeutic to protect against contemporary and emerging CoVs.\n","id":"PMC5844999","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"American Society for Microbiology","authors":[{"firstname":"Maria L.","surname":"Agostini","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Erica L.","surname":"Andres","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Amy C.","surname":"Sims","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Rachel L.","surname":"Graham","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Timothy P.","surname":"Sheahan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xiaotao","surname":"Lu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Everett Clinton","surname":"Smith","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"James Brett","surname":"Case","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Joy Y.","surname":"Feng","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Robert","surname":"Jordan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Adrian S.","surname":"Ray","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Tomas","surname":"Cihlar","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Dustin","surname":"Siegel","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Richard L.","surname":"Mackman","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Michael O.","surname":"Clarke","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ralph S.","surname":"Baric","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Mark R.","surname":"Denison","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Kanta","surname":"Subbarao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Kanta","surname":"Subbarao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Wang, M. et al.

by a newly identified coronavirus, (SARS?CoV?2).\n\n We systematically reviewed the clinical outcomes of using antiretroviral drugs for the prevention and treatment of coronaviruses and planned clinical trials.\n\n\nMethods\nThree databases were screened from inception to 30 March 2020 for studies reporting clinical outcomes of patients with SARS, MERS or COVID?19 treated with antiretrovirals.\n\n\nResults\nFrom an initial screen of 433 titles, two randomized trials and 24 observational studies provided clinical outcome data on the use of antiretroviral drugs; most studies reported outcomes using LPV/r as treatment.\n\n Of the 21 observational studies reporting treatment outcomes, there were three studies among patients with SARS, six studies among patients with MERS and 12 studies among patients with COVID?19. In one randomized trial 99 patients with severe COVID?19 illness were randomized to receive LPV/r (400/100 mg twice a day) and 100 patients to standard of care for 14 days: LPV/r was not associated with a statistically significant difference in time to clinical improvement, although LPV/r given within 12 days of symptoms was associated with shorter time to clinical improvement; 28 day mortality was numerically lower in the LPV/r group (14/99) compared to the control group (25/100), but this difference was not statistically significant.\n\n The second trial found no benefit.\n\n The certainty of the evidence for the randomized trials was low.\n\n In the observational studies 3 out of 361 patients who received LPV/r died; the certainty of evidence was very low.\n\n Three studies reported a possible protective effect of LPV/r as post?exposure prophylaxis.\n\n Again, the certainty of the evidence was very low due to uncertainty due to limited sample size.\n\n\nConclusions\nOn the basis of the available evidence it is uncertain whether LPV/r and other antiretrovirals improve clinical outcomes or prevent infection among patients at high risk of acquiring COVID?19.\n","id":"PMC7158851","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"John Wiley and Sons

Trial of Lopinavir–Ritonavir in Adults Hospitalized with Severe Covid-19","abstract":"Background\nNo therapeutics have yet been proven effective for the treatment of severe illness caused by SARS-CoV-2.\nMethods\nWe conducted a randomized, controlled, open-label trial involving hospitalized adult patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, which causes the respiratory illness Covid-19, and an oxygen saturation (Sao2) of 94% or less while they were breathing ambient air or a ratio of the partial pressure of oxygen (Pao2) to the fraction of inspired oxygen (Fio2) of less than 300 mm Hg.\n\n Patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either lopinavir–ritonavir (400 mg and 100 mg, respectively) twice a day for 14 days, in addition to standard care, or standard care alone.\n\n The primary end point was the time to clinical improvement, defined as the time from randomization to either an improvement of two points on a seven-category ordinal scale or discharge from the hospital, whichever came first.\n\n\nResults\nA total of 199 patients with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection underwent randomization; 99 were assigned to the lopinavir–ritonavir group, and 100 to the standard-care group.\n\n Treatment with lopinavir–ritonavir was not associated with a difference from standard care in the time to clinical improvement (hazard ratio for clinical improvement, 1.24; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.90 to 1.72).\n\n Mortality at 28 days was similar in the lopinavir–ritonavir group and the standard-care group (19.2% vs.\n\n 25.0%; difference, ?5.8 percentage points; 95% CI, ?17.3 to 5.7).\n\n The percentages of patients with detectable viral RNA at various time points were similar.\n\n In a modified intention-to-treat analysis, lopinavir–ritonavir led to a median time to clinical improvement that was shorter by 1 day than that observed with standard care (hazard ratio, 1.39; 95% CI, 1.00 to 1.91).\n\n Gastrointestinal adverse events were more common in the lopinavir–ritonavir group, but serious adverse events were more common in the standard-care group.\n\n Lopinavir–ritonavir treatment was stopped early in 13 patients (13.8%) because of adverse events.\n\n\nConclusions\nIn hospitalized adult patients with severe Covid-19, no benefit was observed with lopinavir–ritonavir treatment beyond standard care.\n\n Future trials in patients with severe illness may help to confirm or exclude the possibility of a treatment benefit.\n\n (Funded by Major Projects of National Science and Technology on New Drug

Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) first broke out in Wuhan (China) and subsequently spread worldwide.\n\n Chloroquine has been sporadically used in treating SARS-CoV-2 infection.\n\n Hydroxychloroquine shares the same mechanism of action as chloroquine, but its more tolerable safety profile makes it the preferred drug to treat malaria and autoimmune conditions.\n\n We propose that the immunomodulatory effect of hydroxychloroquine also may be useful in controlling the cytokine storm that occurs late-phase in critically ill SARS-CoV-2 infected patients.\n\n Currently, there is no evidence to support the use of hydroxychloroquine in SARS-CoV-2 infection.\n\n\nMethods\nThe pharmacological activity of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine was tested using SARS-CoV-2 infected Vero cells.\n\n Physiologically-based pharmacokinetic models (PBPK) were implemented for both drugs separately by integrating their in vitro data.\n\n Using the PBPK models, hydroxychloroquine concentrations in lung fluid were simulated under 5 different dosing regimens to explore the most effective regimen whilst considering the drug’s safety profile.\n\n\nResults\nHydroxychloroquine (EC50=0.72 ?M) was found to be more potent than chloroquine (EC50=5.47 ?M) in vitro.\n\n Based on PBPK models results, a loading dose of 400 mg twice daily of hydroxychloroquine sulfate given orally, followed by a maintenance dose of 200 mg given twice daily for 4 days is recommended for SARS-CoV-2 infection, as it reached three times the potency of chloroquine phosphate when given 500 mg twice daily 5 days in advance.\n\n\nConclusions\nHydroxychloroquine was found to be more potent than chloroquine to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in

hemorrhagic fever (VHF) in humans.\n LASV is endemic in several West African countries with sporadic cases and prolonged outbreaks observed most commonly in Sierra Leone, Liberia, Guinea and Nigeria.\n Additionally several cases of Lassa fever have been imported into North America, Europe and Asia making LASV a global threat to public health.\n Despite this, currently no approved

behavior of favipiravir (FAV) adsorption on the pristine (2,2) graphyne-based ?-nanotube (GYNT) was theoretically studied.\n Also, the Si-doped form (Si-GYNT) and its composite with encapsulated Fe2O3 (Fe2O3@Si-GYNT) were investigated within density functional theory (DFT) calculations, using M05 functionals and B3LYP.\n It was found that FAV is weakly to moderately adsorb on the bare GYNT and Si-GYNT tube, releasing the energy of 2.2 to 19.8 kcal/mol.\n After FAV adsorption, the bare tube's electronic properties are changed.\n Localized impurity is induced at the valence and conduction levels by encapsulating a tiny Fe2O3 cluster.\n As such, the target composite becomes a magnetic material.\n The binding energy between the Fe2O3@Si-GYNT and the FAV molecule becomes substantially stronger (Ead = -25.2 kcal/mol).\n We developed a drug release system in target parts of body, during protonation in the low pH of injured cells, detaching the FAV from the tube surface.\n The drug's reaction mechanism with Fe2O3@Si-GYNT shifts from covalence in the normal environment to hydrogen bonding in an acidic matrix.\n The optimized structure's natural bond orbital, quantum molecular

Due to the advent of different variants of coronavirus, there is an urgent need to identify effective drugs and vaccines to combat rapidly spreading virus varieties across the globe.\n Ferrocene derivatives have attained immense interest as anticancer, antifungal, antibacterial, and antiparasitic drug candidates.\n However, the ability of ferrocene as anti-COVID-19 is not yet explored.\n Therefore, in the present work, we have synthesized four new ferrocene Schiff bases (L1-L4) to understand the active sites and biological activity of ferrocene derivatives by employing various molecular descriptors, frontier molecular orbitals (FMO), electron affinity, ionization potential, and molecular electrostatic potential (MEP).\n A theoretical insight on synthesized ferrocene Schiff bases was accomplished by molecular docking, frontier molecular orbitals energies, active sites, and molecular descriptors which were further compared with drugs being currently used against COVID-19, i.\ne.\n, dexamethasone, hydroxychloroquine, favipiravir (FPV), and remdesivir (RDV).\n Moreover, through the molecular docking approach, we recorded the inhibitions of ferrocene derivatives on core protease (6LU7) protein of SARS-CoV-2 and the effect of substituents on the anti-COVID activity of these synthesized compounds.\n The computational outcome indicated that L1 has a powerful 6LU7 inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 compared to the currently used drugs.\n These results could be helpful to design new ferrocene compounds and explore their potential application in the prevention and treatment of SARS-CoV-2.","id":"PMC8702502","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Elsevier B.V.","authors":[{"firstname":"Ghulam","surname":"Abbas","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Ahmad","surname":"Irfan","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Ishtiaq","surname":"Ahmed","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Firas Khalil","surname":"Al-Zeidaneen","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"S.","surname":"Muthu","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Olaf","surname":"Fuhr","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Renjith","surname":"Thomas","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Becke AD (1993) Density-functional thermochemistry.

electronic structure, spectroscopic (nuclear magnetic resonance, infrared, Raman, electron ionization mass spectrometry, UV-Vis, circular dichroism, and emission) properties, and tautomerism of halogenated favipiravir compounds (fluorine, chlorine, and bromine) from a computational perspective.\n Additionally, the effects of hydration on the proton transfer mechanism of the tautomeric forms of the halogenated favipiravir compounds are discussed.\n Our results suggest that spectroscopic properties allow for the elucidation of such tautomeric forms.\n As is well-known, the favipiravir compound has excellent antiviral properties and hence was recently tested for the treatment of new coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2).\n Through in silico modeling, in the current study, we evaluate the role of such tautomeric forms in order to consider the effect of drug-metabolism in the inhibition process of the main protease (Mpro) and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) of SARS-CoV-2 virus.\n According to the molecular docking, all halogenated compounds presented a better interaction energy than the co-crystallized active ligand (?3.5 kcal mol?1) in the viral RdRp, in both wild-type (?6.3 to ?6.5 kcal mol?1) and variant (?5.4 to ?5.6 kcal mol?1) models.\n The variant analyzed for RdRp (Y176C) decreases the affinity of the keto form of the compounds in the active site, and prevented the ligands from interacting with RNA.\n These findings clearly indicated that all these compounds are promising as drug candidates for this molecular target.\n","id":"PMC9042810","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"The Royal Society of Chemistry","authors":[{"firstname":"Letícia

1.72).\n\n Mortality at 28 days was similar in the lopinavir–ritonavir group and the standard-care group (19.2% vs.\n\n 25.0%; difference, ?5.8 percentage points; 95% CI, ?17.3 to 5.7).\n\n The percentages of patients with detectable viral RNA at various time points were similar.\n\n In a modified intention-to-treat analysis, lopinavir–ritonavir led to a median time to clinical improvement that was shorter by 1 day than that observed with standard care (hazard ratio, 1.39; 95% CI, 1.00 to 1.91).\n\n Gastrointestinal adverse events were more common in the lopinavir–ritonavir group, but serious adverse events were more common in the standard-care group.\n\n Lopinavir–ritonavir treatment was stopped early in 13 patients (13.8%) because of adverse events.\n\n\nConclusions\nIn hospitalized adult patients with severe Covid-19, no benefit was observed with lopinavir–ritonavir treatment beyond standard care.\n\n Future trials in patients with severe illness may help to confirm or exclude the possibility of a treatment benefit.\n\n (Funded by Major Projects of National Science and Technology on New Drug Creation and Development and others; Chinese Clinical Trial Register

()\nIntroduction\nA series of viral pneumonia emerged in December 2019 in Wuhan, China that was later named as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by a novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2. Patients mostly present with fever, cough, dyspnea, fatigue and myalgia with laboratory findings mostly consisting of lymphopenia and increased inflammatory biomarkers. Diagnosis is based on clinical features, imaging studies (peripheral ground glass opacities in chest radiograph) and RT-PCR. There is no approved drug for the treatment of COVID-19 and basically efforts should be made to manage patients with supportive care.\nThe immune response in COVID-19 happens in two phases i.e. viral phase in which the immune system helps eliminate the virus and cytokine release phase in which lung damage will progress. \nCoronaviruses are members of nidovirale order which consist of alfa, beta, gamma and delta family that have the largest known RNA.6 SARS-CoV-2 is a member of betacoronavirus family which also includes SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV strains, causes of outbreaks in 2002 and 2013. Coronavirus genome is translated into two groups of proteins: structural and non-structural ones. The genetic material also encodes 16 non-structural proteins (NSP); RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) is one of the most important ones in virus replication. The life cycle of coronavirus is similar to other RNA viruses like hepatitis C virus (HCV) with similar enzymes and proteins needed for viral replication. \nSofosbuvir/ ledipasvir (SOF/LDP) is an FDA approved drug for the treatment of HCV infection. Sofosbuvir inhibits NS5B-RdRp which is a crucial enzyme in the replication of hepatitis C virus and ledipasvir inhibits NS5A which is an essential protein for RdRp function. \nBased on in vitro experiments with docking, SOF/LDP may be potential drugs for the treatment of COVID-19 but large clinical studies are required to confirm the idea. In this study, efficacy and safety of SOF/LDP were assessed in treatment of patients with mild to moderate COVID-19.\nMethods\nThis randomized open-label clinical trial was designed to evaluate efficacy and safety of SOF/ LDP in treatment of patients with mild to moderate COVID-19. Ethics committee of Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran, approved the study (code number: IR.TUMS.VCR.REC.1398.1074). The trial was registered at Iranian Registry of Clinical Trials (IRCT: 20100228003449N29). Patients were admitted to Imam Khomeini Hospital Complex, a referral tertiary teaching hospital affiliated to Tehran University of Medical Sciences (TUMS), Tehran, Iran. Each patient provided an informed consent. Patients were divided into two groups (SOF/LDP or control group) based on the random allocation. Randomization was performed by permuted blocked randomization. To maintain allocation concealment, we used sequentially numbered, opaque sealed envelopes (SNOSE) method. Ninety identical letter-sized envelopes were provided. Numbers 1 to 90 were written on the envelopes; &quot;SOF/LDP&quot; was written on one set of 45, and &quot;control&quot; was written on the second set. Papers were folded and put in the envelopes. Based on randomized numbers, patients were enrolled in the groups.\nAdult patients (&gt;=18 years old) with highly suspected (according to the clinical signs/symptoms and imaging findings) or confirmed (a positive PCR of pharyngeal or nasopharyngeal samples) COVID-19 who were admitted to medical wards of the hospital, were included. Patients with history of drug allergy, decompensated cirrhosis, severe COVID-19, patients under hemodialysis and pregnant and lactating women were excluded. Mild and moderate COVID-19 were defined as:\nMild disease: mild symptoms such as fever, rhinorrhea, mild cough, sore throat, malaise, headache, muscle pain, or malaise, but with no shortness of breath AND no signs of a more serious lower airway disease AND RR &lt;20, HR &lt;90, oxygen saturation &gt;93% on room air\nModerate disease: more significant lower respiratory symptoms, other than symptoms of mild disease including shortness of breath OR signs of moderate pneumonia, including RR&gt;= 20, oxygen saturation 88% on room air AND lung involvement less than 50 percent in chest X-ray or CT-scan.\nEligible patients received either SOF/ LDP (Zistdaru Danesh Co.) 400/90 mg daily for 10 days plus standard of care (SOF/ LDP group) or only standard of care (control group). In addition to the supportive care modalities, the standard of care according to the hospital protocol included hydroxychloroquine ( HCQ 400 mg BD at first day then 200 mg BD for 7 days) plus atazanavir/ritonavir 300/100 mg daily for 7 days.\nPatients' demographic characteristics, signs/symptoms, vital signs, baseline diseases and past drug history were recorded at the time of hospital admission. During the study period, patients were assessed daily regarding the clinical conditions and the disease progression. Laboratory and para-clinic findings were extracted from the hospital HIS. Patients were assessed daily for clinical response to therapy, time to the clinical response, adverse effects and complications during the hospitalization course.\nAll patients were followed for 14 days. Primary outcomes were clinical response and time to clinical response. Secondary outcomes were safety of treatment, complications during hospitalization, duration of hospital stay and 14-day mortality. Clinical response was defined as one order decline in disease category in the five category ordinal scale. The categories are: death, mechanical ventilation, non-invasive ventilation, oxygen mask or nasal cannula, discharge.\nEstimating clinical response in 95% and 80% of patients in the SOF and control groups respectively, and with power of 80%, the sample size of the study was calculated as 80 persons.\nAll statistical analyses were performed using SPSS version 21 with independent sample t-test and Chi-square test. Normal distribution of variables was checked with Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. Continuous data are reported as median and interquartile range (IQR) and discrete data are reported as percentage. As continues variables had non-normal distribution, non-parametric test (Mann Whitney) was applied to compare these variables between the groups. P values less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant.\nKaplan-Meier survival was used to describe the possibility of hospital discharge and compared the groups using the log rank test. For bivariate analysis, Cox proportional hazards model adjusted for disease severity was applied.\nResults\nOf 116 patients who were assessed for eligibility, 90 met the inclusion criteria and underwent randomization. During study, 8 patients were excluded. Finally 40 patients in the control group and 42 patients in the SOF/ LDP group finished study (figure 1).\nConsort flowchart of study\nThe median (IQR) age of the patients was 61.5 (45.5-74.25) and 63 (53.25-70.75) years in the SOF/ LDP and control group respectively. The most common baseline diseases were hypertension and diabetes mellitus (45.12%), cardiovascular diseases (31.70%) and hypothyroidism (10.97%). Angiotensin receptors blockers (37.80%) and metformin (32.93%) were common medications in patients' drug history. Cough (64.63%), fever (56.1%), dyspnea (48.78%) were common symptoms in patients at the time of hospital admission. RT-PCR results were positive in 50% of patients. Lymphopenia (46.34%) and thrombocytopenia (23.17%) were common abnormal findings in complete blood count analysis. Most patients (87.80%) had some degree of lung involvements in the chest imagings. Median time from onset of the symptoms to hospital admission was 7 days. There was no significant difference between the groups regarding these baseline characteristics.

Most patients received atazanavir/ritonavir (89.02%). Indications for starting stress ulcer and deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis were assessed for all patients and 95.12% and 92.68% of patients received an agent respectively. Antibiotics and corticosteroids were considered for 20.73% and 13.41% of patients respectively.\nMedian peripheral oxygen saturation in admitted patients was 90%. Most patients required respiratory support and received oxygen through face mask (68.29%), nasal cannula (14.63%), invasive (8.53%) or non-invasive (2.44%) ventilation. There was no significant difference between the groups regarding concomitant medications.

Although rates of clinical response were comparable between the groups but response occurred faster in the SOF/LDP group than the control group (2 vs. 4 days respectively, P= 0.02). The possibility of discharge in the two groups is shown in Kaplan-Meier plot (Fig 2). The analysis showed no significant difference between the groups (95% CI:3.45-5.19, p=0.17)\nKaplan-Meier curves for the possibility of discharge from hospital\nUse of SOF/LDP was associated with statistically insignificant shortened length of hospital stay when adjusted for disease severity (HR: 1.55, 95% CI: 0.97-2.49, p=0.06).\nSupportive cares were provided in the medical wards for most patients but 17.07% of patients were transferred to ICU during the hospitalization course. Durations of hospital and ICU stay were comparable between the groups. 14-day mortality rate was 7.14% and 7.5% in the SOF/ LDP and control groups respectively.\nNo adverse effects leading to drug discontinuation occurred. Gastrointestinal events (nausea, vomiting and diarrhea) were the most common side effects (15.85%). QTc prolongation (more than 60 miliseconds) was detected in 6.09% of patients. Acute kidney injury and hyperbilirubinemia occurred in 3 patients in the SOF/ LDP group during the course of hospitalization. Two out of 3 patients had septic shock. After recovery from the shock, serum creatinine and bilirubin returned near to the normal range.\nDiscussion\nIn this trial, efficacy and safety of SOF/LDP in the treatment of the new emerging viral pneumonia, COVID-19 was assessed. Comparing with the standard of care, adding SOF/LDP did not change rate of clinical response, length of hospital or ICU stay and 14-day mortality in patients with mild to moderate COVID-19 pneumonia. However, time to clinical response was significantly shorter in the SOF/ LDP than the control group. Adverse effects were also comparable between the groups.\nSimilar with previous reports, cough, fever and dyspnea were common chief complaints at the time of hospital admission. Also lymphopenia was the most common laboratory abnormality. \nThere are two randomized and one non-randomized clinical trials evaluating the effect of sofosbuvir/ daclatasvir (FOS/DCV) in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. A study by Sadeghi et al. included 66 patients with severe disease that received either FOS/DCV daily plus hydroxychloroquine (with or without lopinavir/ritonavir;LPN/r) or hydroxychloroquine (with or without LPN/r) for 14 days. 33% and 67% of the patients in SOF/DCV and control group received LPN/r (P=0.026). The primary outcome of the study was clinical recovery within 14 days with met in 88% and 67% of SOF/DCV and control groups respectively (P=0.076); duration of hospitalization was also significantly shorter in SOF/DCV group (P=0.041). Clinical recovery in SOF/DCV was observed in 82% of patients treated with LPN/r compared to 91% who didn't receive the combination. All-cause mortality and need for mechanical ventilation were comparable between the groups. (P=0.708, P=0.303 respectively). Patients in both groups received same concomitant corticosteroids (36% vs 24%; P=0.422).\nKasgari et al. studied the effect of SOF/DCV in 48 hospitalized patients with mild to moderate COVID-19. 24 patients were treated with SOF/DCV plus ribavirin and the other 24 received hydroxychloroquine plus LPN/r with or without ribavirin. Time from symptom onset to hospitalization was similar between the groups. Median time to recovery and duration of hospitalization was 6 days in both groups. The overall mortality was 6%, all observed in the control group with younger patients and higher rate of diabetes (P=0.006). Four patients in the control group needed ICU admissions and mechanical ventilation but the difference with SOF/DCV group was not statistically significant (P=0.109). In this study, ribavirin was used in the intervention group and it is not known whether there was any synergistic effect with SOF/DCV and ribavirin concomitant use.\nAnother study conducted by Eslami et al. enrolled 62 patients with severe COVID-19 to receive either SOF/DCV (35 patients) or ribavirin (27 patients) for 14 days both with single dose hydroxychloroquine and LPN/r (for 5 days). Median duration of hospital stay (5 vs 9; P&lt;0.01), time to recovery (6 vs 11; P&lt;0.01), ICU admissions (6 vs 13; P=0.01) and rate of death (2 vs 9; P=0.01) were significantly different between the groups.\nThese three clinical trials show that sofosbuvir/ daclatasvir could reduce the time to recovery in COVID-19 patients but the efficacy of sofosbuvir alone should also be evaluated. Also the study population in these trials was small and larger blinded randomized clinical trials are required to draw a definite result. Patients with different severity of the disease were included and some concomitant treatment also were applied.\nSeveral other agents were examined or are under investigation for treatment of COVID-19. During a randomized clinical trial, lopinavir/ ritonavir did not significantly change time to clinical improvement, 28-day mortality and viral RNA load in patients with severe COVID-19. Median time to clinical improvement was 16 days for patients who received lopinavir/ritonavir or the standard of care. Patients who received lopinavir/ ritonavir experienced more gastrointestinal adverse effects. \nHCQ was another agent which was examined in the treatment of mild to moderate COVID-19. In this study, HCQ (loading dose of 1200 mg daily for three days followed by a maintenance dose of 800 mg daily till 2 weeks) was compared with the standard care. HCQ showed no added benefit to the standard care for conversion of SARS-CoV-2. Time to negative conversion was 7 and 8 days in the control and HCQ group respectively. More gastrointestinal adverse effects were detected in the HCQ group than the control group.\nAlthough adding azithromycin to HCQ increased the rate of viral clearance, but clinical response was not evaluated. \nIn data analysis of 96032 hospitalized COVID-19 patients (a multi-center study from 6 countries), efficacy and safety of chloroquine, chloroquine plus a macrolid (azithromycin or clarithromycin), hydroxychloroquine, hydroxychloroquine plus a macrolid and control group were evaluated. Comparing with the control group, all medications increased mortality and ventricular arrhythmia. Length of hospital stay and rate of mechanical ventilation were also higher in the treatment groups. No benefit was detected with chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine or macrolids in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. \nIn-hospital mortality and cardiac adverse effects of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin (alone or in combination) were assessed in COVID-19 patients. No statistically significant difference in mortality was detected. Patients received HCQ plus azithromycin experienced more cardiac arrests. \nEfficacy and safety of remdesivir, an inhibitor of virus RNA polymerase, were evaluated in hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19. Patients who received remdesivir (200 mg on day 1 followed by 100 mg on days 2-10) numerically (but not statistically significant) experienced faster time to clinical improvement than those who received the placebo (21 days vs 23 days). 28-day mortality and incidence of adverse effects were comparable between the groups. \nPrevious findings were repeated in Beigel et al study. Time to clinical recovery in remdesivir group was shorter compared with the placebo group (11 days vs. 15 days). Also 14-day mortality was not different between the groups. Goldman et al did not find any significant difference between 5-day and 10-day remdesivir treatment course in patients with severe COVID-19. Patients in the 10-day group had more severe disease and a little longer time to clinical recovery compared with patients in the 5-day group. This trial didn't include placebo group and didn't assess the efficacy of remdesivir. \nEfficacy of favipiravir (1600 mg BID day 1 and 600mg BID till day 14) as add-on therapy was compared with lopinavir/ ritonavir (400/100mg for 14 days) in patients receiving IFN-a by aerosol inhalation. Patients in favipiravir group experienced shorter time to viral clearance (4 days vs 11 days) and more improvement in chest imaging in 14 days (91.43% vs 62.22%) compared with the lopinavir/ ritonavir group. \nEffectiveness of interferons in treatment of COVID-19 has been reported. Nebulized interferon a-2b (with or without arbidol) may help recovery from COVID-19 by reducing load of viral inflammatory markers. Combination of interferon beta-1b, lopinavir/ritonavir and ribavirin in hospitalized patients with mild to moderate disease decreased duration of hospital stay and viral load compared to lopinavir/ritonavir alone. \nSimilar with other studies hypertension and diabetes mellitus were the most common baseline diseases in COVID-19 patients. More patients in the control group were receiving statins before diagnosis of COVID-19 than in the SOF/ LDP group. Statins are well known for their anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. There are no RCTs to investigate the effects of statins in COVID-19 but in some other viral infections like H1N1 influenza and Ebola statins decreased disease severity. Statins also up-regulate ACE2 that is the tissue receptor for coronavirus. It was hypothesized that higher levels of ACE2 receptor can decrease the severity of lung injury in COVID-19. Patients with COVID-19 are susceptible to cardiovascular events and statins may protect the patients by preventing cardiovascular damage. \nFour patients in the SOF/LDP group received low dose (1000 mg daily) of parenteral vitamin C. Vitamin C has antioxidant properties but its efficacy in the treatment of COVID-19 has not been defined. There is an ongoing trial to assess effects of high dose vitamin C on mortality and length of hospital stay in patients with COVID-19. \nSARS-CoV-2 is in a member of nidoviridale order and betacoronaviridae family. Four viruses in this family are known as causes of common cold (pharyngitis, rhinitis, sinusitis, diarrhea). SARS and MERS-CoV are two other members that caused fatal pneumonia outbreaks in 2003 and 2014 respectively.5-7 The seventh strain of the family is SARS-CoV-2 that has the genetic material 80% identical to SARS-CoV and 50% identical to MERS-CoV.33 SARS-CoV-2 genome is an enveloped, single-stranded, positive-sense RNA with the first 2/3 of the genome translated into 16 non-structural proteins (NSPs) and the other 1/3 translated into non-structural proteins (spike, envelope, nucleocapsid, membrane proteins). RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) is one of the most important NSPs and is a crucial viral enzyme in the life cycle of different viruses, including the hepatitis C virus (HCV), the Zika virus (ZIKV), and coronaviruses (CoVs). \nSofosbuvir is a direct-acting antiviral with NS5B-RdRp inhibitory property. In 2014, the combination of SOF/LSD (a NS5A protein inhibitor) received US FDA approval for the treatment of genotype 1 HCV patients. HCV NS5B-RdRp requires nucleotide triphosphates as substrate to synthesize RNA, a process with no proofreading function. Sofosbuvir acts like the substrate of the enzyme which terminates the RNA synthesis by incorporating into the RNA chain. \nThe two-phase immune response i.e. viral and cytokine release happens in COVID-19. Treatment strategies for COVID-19 are categorized into inhibition of CoV fusion/entry, disruption of CoV replication and suppression of excessive inflammatory response.5 If patient enters the cytokine release state then the antiviral medications do not seem to help resolving the disease. Regarding the phase of the disease and the pathway targeted for treatment, distinct approaches are helpful.\nThere are in silico studies which assessed the potential activity of sofosbuvir against coronavirus RdRp. Sofosbuvir successfully bonds with the coronavirus polymerase.13In two studies published in 2020, sofosbuvir inhibited coronavirus replication by fitting into enzyme active site. Ledipasvir has ability to attach to main protease enzymes of the novel coronavirus and in combination with sofosbuvir, it may be a candidate for the treatment of COVID-19. \nThere is no data about the 50% of maximum inhibitory concentration (IC 50) of sofosbuvir for coronavirus. However, different values of IC were reported for hepatitis C, hepatitis E, hepatitis A, ZIKA, Dengue and West Nile virus. For HCV it was detected between 0.016- 1.2 microM. According to the replicons, sofosbuvir inhibited HEV replication with IC 50 between 1.2-10 microM.46 Dose-dependent activity of sofosbuvir against HEV has also been reported. \nIn-vitro activity (IC 50 of 6.3microMu) of sofosbuvir against hepatitis A virus was detected. The IC 50 of 0.38-44microM was reported for 3 strains of Zika virus. In term of West Nile virus (WNV), the IC 50 values of sofosbuvir were 1.2muM and 63.4muM in liver and lung cells respectively. Compared with hepatic cells, concentrations of sofosbuvir were much lower in kidney and lung cells. It could be due to sofosbuvir being less activated in these cells. Other studies on different cell lines are needed to evaluate the activity of sofosbuvir in tissues other than hepatic cells.\nData regarding effectiveness of antivirals against SARS-CoV2 are scarce. It seems that if antiviral medications are considered, they should be initiated as soon as possible in early stage of the infection, when the damage to lung tissues has not extended. When the inflammatory process starts and cytokine storm takes place, no benefit is expected to be seen with antiviral drugs. Sofosbuvir is an available drug in many countries and can play a role in the treatment of mild to moderate COVID-19. However, clinical trials with larger sample sizes are needed to confirm efficacy of sofosbuvir in treatment of COVID-19.\nDue to the special circumstances and multiplicity of the clinical trials, we could not enroll more patients in our study to draw a definite conclusion. Also considering follow-up RT-PCR and chest imaging were not possible.\nConclusion\nTo the best of our knowledge, this was the first study that evaluated efficacy and safety of SOF/LDP in the treatment of mild to moderate COVID-19. Added to the standard of care, SOF/LDP accelerated time to the clinical response. However, rate of clinical response, duration of hospital or ICU stay and 14-day mortality were not different.

synthesis","abstract":"Background\nid='Par1'>The COVID-19 pandemic has placed an unprecedented strain on health systems, with rapidly increasing demand for healthcare in hospitals and intensive care units (ICUs) worldwide.\n\n As the pandemic escalates, determining the resulting needs for healthcare resources (beds, staff, equipment) has become a key priority for many countries.\n\n Projecting future demand requires estimates of how long patients with COVID-19 need different levels of hospital care.\n\n\nMethods\nid='Par2'>We performed a systematic review of early evidence on length of stay (LoS) of patients with COVID-19 in hospital and in ICU.\n\n We subsequently developed a method to generate LoS distributions which combines summary statistics reported in multiple studies, accounting for differences in sample sizes.\n\n Applying this approach, we provide distributions for total hospital and ICU LoS from studies in China and elsewhere, for use by the community.\n\n\nResults\nid='Par3'>We identified 52 studies, the majority from China (46/52).\n\n Median hospital LoS ranged from 4 to 53 days within China, and 4 to 21 days outside of China, across 45 studies.\n\n ICU LoS was reported by eight studies—four each within and outside China—with median values ranging from 6 to 12 and 4 to 19 days, respectively.\n\n Our summary distributions have a median hospital LoS of 14 (IQR 10–19) days for China, compared with 5 (IQR 3–9) days outside of China.\n\n For ICU, the summary distributions are more similar (median (IQR) of 8 (5–13) days for China and 7 (4–11) days outside of China).\n\n There was a visible difference by discharge status, with patients who were discharged alive having longer LoS than those who died during their admission, but no trend associated with study date.\n\n\nConclusion\nid='Par4'>Patients with COVID-19 in China appeared to remain in hospital for longer than elsewhere.\n\n This may be explained by differences in criteria for admission and discharge between countries, and different timing within the pandemic.\n\n In the absence of local data, the combined summary LoS distributions provided here can be used to model bed demands for contingency planning and then updated, with the novel method presented here, as more studies with aggregated statistics emerge outside

Comparisons between the viruses were made.\n\n\nResults\nInadequate risk assessment regarding the urgency of the situation, and limited reporting on the virus within China has, in part, led to the rapid spread of COVID-19 throughout mainland China and into proximal and distant countries.\n\n Compared with SARS and MERS, COVID-19 has spread more rapidly, due in part to increased globalization and the focus of the epidemic.\n\n Wuhan, China is a large hub connecting the North, South, East and West of China via railways and a major international airport.\n\n The availability of connecting flights, the timing of the outbreak during the Chinese (Lunar) New Year, and the massive rail transit hub located in Wuhan has enabled the virus to perforate throughout China, and eventually, globally.\n\n\nConclusions\nWe conclude that we did not learn from the two prior epidemics of coronavirus and were ill-prepared to deal with the challenges the COVID-19 epidemic has posed.\n\n Future research should attempt to address the uses and implications of internet of things (IoT) technologies for mapping the spread of infection.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7197734","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Oxford University Press","authors":[{"firstname":"Noah C","surname":"Peeri","email":"noah.peeri@my.unthsc.edu","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Nistha","surname":"Shrestha","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Nistha","surname":"Shrestha","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Md Siddikur","surname":"Rahman","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Rafdzah","surname":"Zaki","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Zhengqi","surname":"Tan","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Saana","surname":"Bibi","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Mahdi","surname":"Baghbanzadeh","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Nasrin","surname":"Aghamohammadi","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Wenyi","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Ubydul","surname":"Haque","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"10.1002/eji.202070035","date":"1970-01-01","title":"COVID?19: Lessons from SARS and MERS","abstract":"","id":"PMC7163482","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"John Wiley and Sons Inc.","authors":[{"firstname":"Mirae","surname":"Park","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Ryan S.","surname":"Thwaites","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Peter J.

associated with the duration of hospitalisation among COVID-19 patients in Vietnam: A survival analysis","abstract":"Background\nThe median duration of hospital stays due to COVID-19 has been reported in several studies on China as 10?13 days.\n\n Global studies have indicated that the length of hospitalisation depends on different factors, such as the time elapsed from exposure to symptom onset, and from symptom onset to hospital admission, as well as specificities of the country under study.\n\n The goal of this paper is to identify factors associated with the median duration of hospital stays of COVID-19 patients during the second COVID-19 wave that hit Vietnam from 5 March to 8 April 2020.\nMethod\nWe used retrospective data on 133 hospitalised patients with COVID-19 recorded over at least two weeks during the study period.\n\n The Cox proportional-hazards regression model was applied to determine the potential risk factors associated with length of hospital stay.\n\n\nResults\nThere were 65 (48.9%) females, 98 (73.7%) patients 48 years old or younger, 15 (11.3%) persons with comorbidities, 21 (16.0%) severely ill patients and 5 (3.8%) individuals with life-threatening conditions.\n\n Eighty-two (61.7%) patients were discharged after testing negative for the SARS-CoV-2 virus, 51 were still in the hospital at the end of the study period and none died.\n\n The median duration of stay in a hospital was 21 (IQR: 16–34) days.\n\n The multivariable Cox regression model showed that age, residence and sources of contamination were significantly associated with longer duration of hospitalisation.\n\n\nConclusion\nA close look at how long COVID-19 patients stayed in the hospital could provide an overview of their treatment process in Vietnam, and support the country's National Steering Committee on COVID-19 Prevention and Control in the efficient allocation of resources over the next stages of the COVID-19 prevention period.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7306545","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Cambridge University Press","authors":[{"firstname":"Pham

in a short timeframe.\n\n Services are quickly adapting to new challenges in the practical delivery of end-of-life care to patients in the community including through virtual consultations and in the provision of timely symptom control.\n\n\nAim:\nTo synthesise existing evidence related to the delivery of palliative and end-of-life care by primary healthcare professionals in epidemics and pandemics.\n\n\nDesign:\nRapid systematic review using modified systematic review methods, with narrative synthesis of the evidence.\n\n\nData sources:\nSearches were carried out in Medline, Embase, PsychINFO, CINAHL and Web of Science on 7th March 2020.\nResults:\nOnly five studies met the inclusion criteria, highlighting a striking lack of evidence base for the response of primary healthcare services in palliative care during epidemics and pandemics.\n\n All were observational studies.\n\n Findings were synthesised using a pandemic response framework according to ‘systems’ (community providers feeling disadvantaged in terms of receiving timely information and protocols), ‘space’ (recognised need for more care in the community), ‘staff’ (training needs and resilience) and ‘stuff’ (other aspects of managing care in pandemics including personal protective equipment, cleaning care settings and access to investigations).\n\n\nConclusions:\nAs the COVID-19 pandemic progresses, there is an urgent need for research to provide increased understanding of the role of primary care and community nursing services in palliative care, alongside hospices and community specialist palliative care providers.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7528540","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"SAGE

coronavirus indicating person-to-person transmission: a study of a family cluster","abstract":"Background\nAn ongoing outbreak of pneumonia associated with a novel coronavirus was reported in Wuhan city, Hubei province, China.\n\n Affected patients were geographically linked with a local wet market as a potential source.\n\n No data on person-to-person or nosocomial transmission have been published to date.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this study, we report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, radiological, and microbiological findings of five patients in a family cluster who presented with unexplained pneumonia after returning to Shenzhen, Guangdong province, China, after a visit to Wuhan, and an additional family member who did not travel to Wuhan.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of genetic sequences from these patients were done.\n\n\nFindings\nFrom Jan 10, 2020, we enrolled a family of six patients who travelled to Wuhan from Shenzhen between Dec 29, 2019 and Jan 4, 2020. Of six family members who travelled to Wuhan, five were identified as infected with the novel coronavirus.\n\n Additionally, one family member, who did not travel to Wuhan, became infected with the virus after several days of contact with four of the family members.\n\n None of the family members had contacts with Wuhan markets or animals, although two had visited a Wuhan hospital.\n\n Five family members (aged 36–66 years) presented with fever, upper or lower respiratory tract symptoms, or diarrhoea, or a combination of these 3–6 days after exposure.\n\n They presented to our hospital (The University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen) 6–10 days after symptom onset.\n\n They and one asymptomatic child (aged 10 years) had radiological ground-glass lung opacities.\n\n Older patients (aged &gt;60 years) had more systemic symptoms, extensive radiological ground-glass lung changes, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and increased C-reactive protein and lactate dehydrogenase levels.\n\n The nasopharyngeal or throat swabs of these six patients were negative for known respiratory microbes by point-of-care multiplex RT-PCR, but five patients (four adults and the child) were RT-PCR positive for genes encoding the internal RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and surface Spike protein of this novel coronavirus, which were confirmed by Sanger sequencing.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these five patients' RT-PCR amplicons and two full genomes by next-generation sequencing showed that this is a novel coronavirus, which is closest to the bat severe acute respiatory syndrome

January 2020. We analyzed data on the first 425 confirmed cases in Wuhan to determine the epidemiologic characteristics of NCIP.\n\n\nMethods\nWe collected information on demographic characteristics, exposure history, and illness timelines of laboratory-confirmed cases of NCIP that had been reported by January 22, 2020. We described characteristics of the cases and estimated the key epidemiologic time-delay distributions.\n\n In the early period of exponential growth, we estimated the epidemic doubling time and the basic reproductive number.\n\n\nResults\nAmong the first 425 patients with confirmed NCIP, the median age was 59 years and 56% were male.\n\n The majority of cases (55%) with onset before January 1, 2020, were linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, as compared with 8.6% of the subsequent cases.\n\n The mean incubation period was 5.2 days (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.1 to 7.0), with the 95th percentile of the distribution at 12.5 days.\n\n In its early stages, the epidemic doubled in size every 7.4 days.\n\n With a mean serial interval of 7.5 days (95% CI, 5.3 to 19), the basic reproductive number was estimated to be 2.2 (95% CI, 1.4 to 3.9).\n\n\nConclusions\nOn the basis of this information, there is evidence that human-to-human transmission has occurred among close contacts since the middle of December 2019.

outcomes in patients with a number of different malignancies.\n\n The objective of this study was to assess the relationship between NLR and mortality in a population of adult critically ill patients.\n\n\nMethods\nWe performed an observational cohort study of unselected intensive care unit (ICU) patients based on records in a large clinical database.\n\n We computed individual patient NLR and categorized patients by quartile of this ratio.\n\n The association of NLR quartiles and 28-day mortality was assessed using multivariable logistic regression.\n\n Secondary outcomes included mortality in the ICU, in-hospital mortality and 1-year mortality.\n\n An a priori subgroup analysis of patients with versus without sepsis was performed to assess any differences in the relationship between the NLR and outcomes in these cohorts.\n\n\nResults\nA total of 5,056 patients were included.\n\n Their 28-day mortality rate was 19%.\n\n The median age of the cohort was 65 years, and 47% were female.\n\n The median NLR for the entire cohort was 8.9 (interquartile range, 4.99 to 16.21).\n\n Following multivariable adjustments, there was a stepwise increase in mortality with increasing quartiles of NLR (first quartile: reference category; second quartile odds ratio (OR) = 1.32; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.03 to 1.71; third quartile OR = 1.43; 95% CI, 1.12 to 1.83; 4th quartile OR = 1.71; 95% CI, 1.35 to 2.16).\n\n A similar stepwise relationship was identified in the subgroup of patients who presented without sepsis.\n\n The NLR was not associated with 28-day mortality in patients with sepsis.\n\n Increasing quartile of NLR was statistically significantly associated with secondary outcome.\n\n\nConclusion\nThe NLR is associated with outcomes in unselected critically ill patients.\n\n In patients with sepsis, there was no statistically significant relationship between NLR and mortality.\n\n Further investigation is required to increase understanding of the pathophysiology of this relationship and to validate these findings with data collected prospectively.\n\n\nElectronic supplementary material\nThe online version of this article

recently reported in Wuhan, Hubei province, China.\n As of 25 January 2020, at least 1,975 cases had been reported since the first patient was hospitalized on 12 December 2019. Epidemiological investigations have suggested that the outbreak was associated with a seafood market in Wuhan.\n Here we study a single patient who was a worker at the market and who was admitted to the Central Hospital of Wuhan on 26 December 2019 while experiencing a severe respiratory syndrome that included fever, dizziness and a cough.\n Metagenomic RNA sequencing4 of a sample of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from the patient identified a new RNA virus strain from the family Coronaviridae, which is designated here ‘WH-Human 1’ coronavirus (and has also been referred to as ‘2019-nCoV’).\n Phylogenetic analysis of the complete viral genome (29,903 nucleotides) revealed that the virus was most closely related (89.1% nucleotide similarity) to a group of SARS-like

corticosteroids has only been suggested by uncontrolled observations, and the role of these agents in therapy remains to be established by randomized controlled studies.\n Both ribavirin and corticosteroids have very significant side effects.\n The lopinavir/ritonavir combination has been shown to reduce the intubation rate and the incidence of adverse clinical outcomes when used with ribavirin.\n When patients deteriorate clinically despite treatment with ribavirin and corticosteroids, rescue treatment with convalescent plasma and immunoglobulin may be beneficial.\n Noninvasive positive pressure ventilation is a sound treatment for SARS patients with respiratory failure if administered with due precaution in the correct environment.\n Interferons and other novel agents may hold promise as useful anti-SARS therapies in the future.\n The experience with traditional Chinese medicine is encouraging, and its use as an adjuvant should be further investigated.\n","id":"PMC7088345","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Springer-Verlag","authors":[{"firstname":"S.

of the lung extracellular matrix and production and degradation must be carefully balanced.\n We have discovered an imbalance in hyaluronan production following resolution of a severe lung influenza virus infection, driven by hyaluronan synthase 2 from epithelial cells, endothelial cells and fibroblasts.\n Furthermore hyaluronan is complexed with inter-?-inhibitor heavy chains due to elevated TNF-stimulated gene 6 expression and sequesters CD44-expressing macrophages.\n We show that intranasal administration of exogenous hyaluronidase is sufficient to release inter-?-inhibitor heavy

with the 2019 novel coronavirus indicating person-to-person transmission: a study of a family cluster","abstract":"Background\nAn ongoing outbreak of pneumonia associated with a novel coronavirus was reported in Wuhan city, Hubei province, China.\n\n Affected patients were geographically linked with a local wet market as a potential source.\n\n No data on person-to-person or nosocomial transmission have been published to date.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this study, we report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, radiological, and microbiological findings of five patients in a family cluster who presented with unexplained pneumonia after returning to Shenzhen, Guangdong province, China, after a visit to Wuhan, and an additional family member who did not travel to Wuhan.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of genetic sequences from these patients were done.\n\n\nFindings\nFrom Jan 10, 2020, we enrolled a family of six patients who travelled to Wuhan from Shenzhen between Dec 29, 2019 and Jan 4, 2020. Of six family members who travelled to Wuhan, five were identified as infected with the novel coronavirus.\n\n Additionally, one family member, who did not travel to Wuhan, became infected with the virus after several days of contact with four of the family members.\n\n None of the family members had contacts with Wuhan markets or animals, although two had visited a Wuhan hospital.\n\n Five family members (aged 36–66 years) presented with fever, upper or lower respiratory tract symptoms, or diarrhoea, or a combination of these 3–6 days after exposure.\n\n They presented to our hospital (The University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen) 6–10 days after symptom onset.\n\n They and one asymptomatic child (aged 10 years) had radiological ground-glass lung opacities.\n\n Older patients (aged &gt;60 years) had more systemic symptoms, extensive radiological ground-glass lung changes, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and increased C-reactive protein and lactate dehydrogenase levels.\n\n The nasopharyngeal or throat swabs of these six patients were negative for known respiratory microbes by point-of-care multiplex RT-PCR, but five patients (four adults and the child) were RT-PCR positive for genes encoding the internal RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and surface Spike protein of this novel coronavirus, which were confirmed by Sanger sequencing.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these five patients' RT-PCR amplicons and two full genomes by next-generation sequencing showed that this is a novel coronavirus, which is closest to the bat severe acute respiatory syndrome (SARS)-related coronaviruses found in Chinese horseshoe bats.\n\n\nInterpretation\nOur findings are consistent with person-to-person transmission of this novel coronavirus in hospital and family settings, and the reports of infected travellers in other geographical regions.\n\n\nFunding\nThe Shaw Foundation Hong Kong, Michael Seak-Kan Tong, Respiratory Viral Research Foundation Limited, Hui

Protease<","abstract":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is an emerging infectious disease caused by a novel human coronavirus.\n Viral maturation requires a main protease (3CLpro) to cleave the virus-encoded polyproteins.\n We report here that the 3CLpro containing additional N- and/or C-terminal segments of the polyprotein sequences undergoes autoprocessing and yields the mature protease in vitro.\n The dimeric three-dimensional structure of the C145A mutant protease shows that the active site of one protomer binds with the C-terminal six amino acids of the protomer from another asymmetric unit, mimicking the product-bound form and suggesting a possible mechanism for maturation.\n The P1 pocket of the active site binds the Gln side chain specifically, and the P2 and P4 sites are clustered together to accommodate large hydrophobic side chains.\n The tagged C145A mutant protein served as a substrate for the wild-type protease, and the N terminus was first digested (55-fold faster) at the Gln-1-Ser1 site followed by the C-terminal cleavage at the Gln306-Gly307 site.\n Analytical ultracentrifuge of the quaternary structures of the tagged and mature proteases reveals the remarkably tighter dimer formation for the mature enzyme (Kd = 0.35 nm) than for the mutant (C145A) containing 10 extra N-terminal (Kd = 17.2 nm) or C-terminal amino acids (Kd = 5.6 nm).\n The data indicate that immature 3CLpro can form dimer enabling it to undergo autoprocessing to yield the mature enzyme, which further serves as a seed for facilitated maturation.\n Taken together, this study provides insights into the maturation process of the SARS 3CLpro from the polyprotein and design of new structure-based inhibitors.\n","id":"PMC8062786","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"ASBMB.

evaluating their contributions to dimer stability and catalytic activity by biophysical and biochemical methods.\n These residues are involved in dimerization through hydrogen bonding and broadly located in the N-terminal finger, the ?-helix A? of domain I, and the oxyanion loop near the S1 substrate-binding subsite in domain II.\n We revealed that all seven single mutated proteases still have the dimeric species but the monomer–dimer equilibria of these mutants vary from each other, implying that these residues might contribute differently to the dimer stability.\n Such a conclusion could be further verified by the results that the proteolytic activities of these mutants also decrease to varying degrees.\n The present study would help us better understand the dimerization-activity

of Glu-166 Blocks the Substrate-Induced Dimerization of SARS Coronavirus Main Protease","abstract":"The maturation of SARS coronavirus involves the autocleavage of polyproteins 1a and 1ab by the main protease (Mpro) and a papain-like protease; these represent attractive targets for the development of anti-SARS drugs.\n The functional unit of Mpro is a homodimer, and each subunit has a His-41?Cys-145 catalytic dyad.\n Current thinking in this area is that Mpro dimerization is essential for catalysis, although the influence of the substrate binding on the dimer formation has never been explored.\n Here, we delineate the contributions of the peptide substrate to Mpro dimerization.\n Enzyme kinetic assays indicate that the monomeric mutant R298A/L exhibits lower activity but in a cooperative manner.\n Analytical ultracentrifugation analyses indicate that in the presence of substrates, the major species of R298A/L shows a significant size shift toward the dimeric form and the monomer-dimer dissociation constant of R298A/L decreases by 12- to 17-fold, approaching that for wild-type.\n Furthermore, this substrate-induced dimerization was found to be reversible after substrates were removed.\n Based on the crystal structures, a key residue, Glu-166, which is responsible for recognizing the Gln-P1 of the substrate and binding to Ser-1 of another protomer, will interact with Asn-142 and block the S1 subsite entrance in the monomer.\n Our studies indicate that mutation of Glu-166 in the R298A mutant indeed blocks the substrate-induced dimerization.\n This demonstrates that Glu-166 plays a pivotal role in connecting the substrate binding site with the dimer interface.\n We conclude that protein-ligand and protein-protein interactions are closely

Effects","abstract":"Background\nThe SARS outbreak of 2002–2003 presented clinicians with a new, life-threatening disease for which they had no experience in treating and no research on the effectiveness of treatment options.\n\n The World Health Organization (WHO) expert panel on SARS treatment requested a systematic review and comprehensive summary of treatments used for SARS-infected patients in order to guide future treatment and identify priorities for research.\n\n\nMethods and Findings\nIn response to the WHO request we conducted a systematic review of the published literature on ribavirin, corticosteroids, lopinavir and ritonavir (LPV/r), type I interferon (IFN), intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), and SARS convalescent plasma from both in vitro studies and in SARS patients.\n\n We also searched for clinical trial evidence of treatment for acute respiratory distress syndrome.\n\n Sources of data were the literature databases MEDLINE, EMBASE, BIOSIS, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) up to February 2005. Data from publications were extracted and evidence within studies was classified using predefined criteria.\n\n In total, 54 SARS treatment studies, 15 in vitro studies, and three acute respiratory distress syndrome studies met our inclusion criteria.\n\n Within in vitro studies, ribavirin, lopinavir, and type I IFN showed inhibition of SARS-CoV in tissue culture.\n\n In SARS-infected patient reports on ribavirin, 26 studies were classified as inconclusive, and four showed possible harm.\n\n Seven studies of convalescent plasma or IVIG, three of IFN type I, and two of LPV/r were inconclusive.\n\n In 29 studies of steroid use, 25 were inconclusive and four were classified as causing possible harm.\n\n\nConclusions\nDespite an extensive literature reporting on SARS treatments, it was not possible to determine whether treatments benefited patients during the SARS outbreak.\n\n Some may have been harmful.\n\n Clinical trials should be designed to validate a standard protocol for dosage and timing, and to accrue data in real time during future outbreaks to monitor specific adverse effects and help inform treatment.\n\n\n","id":"PMC1564166","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Public Library of Science","authors":[{"firstname":"Lauren J","surname":"Stockman","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Richard","surname":"Bellamy","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Paul","surname":"Garner","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Donald","surname":"Low","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Donald","surname":"Low","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Coronavirus COVID-19 (formerly known as Wuhan coronavirus and 2019-nCoV) - what we can find out on a structural bioinformatics level.","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.5812/archcid.13823","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Lopinavir; a potent drug against coronavirus infection: insight from molecular docking study.","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1016/j.jtbi.2008.07.030","date":"2008-07-16","title":"Molecular dynamic simulations analysis of ritronavir and lopinavir as SARS-CoV 3CL<sup>pro</sup> inhibitors","abstract":"Since the emergence of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) to date, neither an effective antiviral drug nor a vaccine against SARS is available.\n However, it was found that a mixture of two HIV-1 proteinase inhibitors, lopinavir and ritonavir, exhibited some signs of effectiveness against the SARS virus.\n To understand the fine details of the molecular interactions between these proteinase inhibitors and the SARS virus via complexation, molecular dynamics simulations were carried out for the SARS-CoV 3CLpro free enzyme (free SARS) and its complexes with lopinavir (SARS–LPV) and ritonavir (SARS–RTV).\n The results show that flap closing was clearly observed when the inhibitors bind to the active site of SARS-CoV 3CLpro.\n The binding affinities of LPV and RTV to SARS-CoV 3CLpro do not show any significant difference.\n In addition, six hydrogen bonds were detected in the SARS–LPV system, while seven hydrogen bonds were found in SARS–RTV complex.\n","id":"PMC7094092","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Elsevier Ltd.","authors":[{"firstname":"Veena","surname":"Nukoolkarn","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Vannajan Sanghiran","surname":"Lee","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Maturos","surname":"Malaisree","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Ornjira","surname":"Aruksakulwong","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Supot","surname":"Hannongbua","email":"supot.h@chula.ac.th","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"10.1016/j.bmc.2004.03.035","date":"2004-03-16","title":"Old drugs as lead compounds for a new disease?

Lopinavir–Ritonavir in Adults Hospitalized with Severe Covid-19","abstract":"Background\nNo therapeutics have yet been proven effective for the treatment of severe illness caused by SARS-CoV-2.\nMethods\nWe conducted a randomized, controlled, open-label trial involving hospitalized adult patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, which causes the respiratory illness Covid-19, and an oxygen saturation (Sao2) of 94% or less while they were breathing ambient air or a ratio of the partial pressure of oxygen (Pao2) to the fraction of inspired oxygen (Fio2) of less than 300 mm Hg.\n\n Patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either lopinavir–ritonavir (400 mg and 100 mg, respectively) twice a day for 14 days, in addition to standard care, or standard care alone.\n\n The primary end point was the time to clinical improvement, defined as the time from randomization to either an improvement of two points on a seven-category ordinal scale or discharge from the hospital, whichever came first.\n\n\nResults\nA total of 199 patients with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection underwent randomization; 99 were assigned to the lopinavir–ritonavir group, and 100 to the standard-care group.\n\n Treatment with lopinavir–ritonavir was not associated with a difference from standard care in the time to clinical improvement (hazard ratio for clinical improvement, 1.24; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.90 to 1.72).\n\n Mortality at 28 days was similar in the lopinavir–ritonavir group and the standard-care group (19.2% vs.\n\n 25.0%; difference, ?5.8 percentage points; 95% CI, ?17.3 to 5.7).\n\n The percentages of patients with detectable viral RNA at various time points were similar.\n\n In a modified intention-to-treat analysis, lopinavir–ritonavir led to a median time to clinical improvement that was shorter by 1 day than that observed with standard care (hazard ratio, 1.39; 95% CI, 1.00 to 1.91).\n\n Gastrointestinal adverse events were more common in the lopinavir–ritonavir group, but serious adverse events were more common in the standard-care group.\n\n Lopinavir–ritonavir treatment was stopped early in 13 patients (13.8%) because of adverse events.\n\n\nConclusions\nIn hospitalized adult patients with severe Covid-19, no benefit was observed with lopinavir–ritonavir treatment beyond standard care.\n\n Future trials in patients with severe illness may help to confirm or exclude the possibility of a treatment benefit.\n\n (Funded by Major Projects of National Science and Technology on New Drug

have raised great public health concern globally.\n\n Here, we report a novel bat-origin CoV causing severe and fatal pneumonia in humans.\n\n\nMethods\nWe collected clinical data and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) specimens from five patients with severe pneumonia from Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital, Hubei province, China.\n\n Nucleic acids of the BAL were extracted and subjected to next-generation sequencing.\n\n Virus isolation was carried out, and maximum-likelihood phylogenetic trees were constructed.\n\n\nResults\nFive patients hospitalized from December 18 to December 29, 2019 presented with fever, cough, and dyspnea accompanied by complications of acute respiratory distress syndrome.\n\n Chest radiography revealed diffuse opacities and consolidation.\n\n One of these patients died.\n\n Sequence results revealed the presence of a previously unknown ?-CoV strain in all five patients, with 99.8% to 99.9% nucleotide identities among the isolates.\n\n These isolates showed 79.0% nucleotide identity with the sequence of SARS-CoV (GenBank NC_004718) and 51.8% identity with the sequence of MERS-CoV (GenBank NC_019843).\n\n The virus is phylogenetically closest to a bat SARS-like CoV (SL-ZC45, GenBank MG772933) with 87.6% to 87.7% nucleotide identity, but is in a separate clade.\n\n Moreover, these viruses have a single intact open reading frame gene 8, as a further indicator of bat-origin CoVs.\n\n However, the amino acid sequence of the tentative receptor-binding domain resembles that of SARS-CoV, indicating that these viruses might use the same receptor.\n\n\nConclusion\nA novel bat-borne CoV was identified that is associated with severe and fatal respiratory disease in humans.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7147275","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Wolters Kluwer

between patients who had been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and those who had not.\n\n\nFindings\nBy Jan 2, 2020, 41 admitted hospital patients had been identified as having laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection.\n\n Most of the infected patients were men (30 [73%] of 41); less than half had underlying diseases (13 [32%]), including diabetes (eight [20%]), hypertension (six [15%]), and cardiovascular disease (six [15%]).\n\n Median age was 49·0 years (IQR 41·0–58·0).\n\n 27 (66%) of 41 patients had been exposed to Huanan seafood market.\n\n One family cluster was found.\n\n Common symptoms at onset of illness were fever (40 [98%] of 41 patients), cough (31 [76%]), and myalgia or fatigue (18 [44%]); less common symptoms were sputum production (11 [28%] of 39), headache (three [8%] of 38), haemoptysis (two [5%] of 39), and diarrhoea (one [3%] of 38).\n\n Dyspnoea developed in 22 (55%) of 40 patients (median time from illness onset to dyspnoea 8·0 days [IQR 5·0–13·0]).\n\n 26 (63%) of 41 patients had lymphopenia.\n\n All 41 patients had pneumonia with abnormal findings on chest CT.\n\n Complications included acute respiratory distress syndrome (12 [29%]), RNAaemia (six [15%]), acute cardiac injury (five [12%]) and secondary infection (four [10%]).\n\n 13 (32%) patients were admitted to an ICU and six (15%) died.\n\n Compared with non-ICU patients, ICU patients had higher plasma levels of IL2, IL7, IL10, GSCF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNF?.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe 2019-nCoV infection caused clusters of severe respiratory illness similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and was associated with ICU admission and high mortality.\n\n Major gaps in our knowledge of the origin, epidemiology, duration of human transmission, and clinical spectrum of disease need fulfilment by future studies.\n\n\nFunding\nMinistry of Science and Technology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, National Natural Science Foundation of China,

characterisation and epidemiology of 2019 novel coronavirus: implications for virus origins and receptor binding","abstract":"Background\nIn late December, 2019, patients presenting with viral pneumonia due to an unidentified microbial agent were reported in Wuhan, China.\n\n A novel coronavirus was subsequently identified as the causative pathogen, provisionally named 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).\n\n As of Jan 26, 2020, more than 2000 cases of 2019-nCoV infection have been confirmed, most of which involved people living in or visiting Wuhan, and human-to-human transmission has been confirmed.\n\n\nMethods\nWe did next-generation sequencing of samples from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and cultured isolates from nine inpatients, eight of whom had visited the Huanan seafood market in Wuhan.\n\n Complete and partial 2019-nCoV genome sequences were obtained from these individuals.\n\n Viral contigs were connected using Sanger sequencing to obtain the full-length genomes, with the terminal regions determined by rapid amplification of cDNA ends.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these 2019-nCoV genomes and those of other coronaviruses was used to determine the evolutionary history of the virus and help infer its likely origin.\n\n Homology modelling was done to explore the likely receptor-binding properties of the virus.\n\n\nFindings\nThe ten genome sequences of 2019-nCoV obtained from the nine patients were extremely similar, exhibiting more than 99·98% sequence identity.\n\n Notably, 2019-nCoV was closely related (with 88% identity) to two bat-derived severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-like coronaviruses, bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21, collected in 2018 in Zhoushan, eastern China, but were more distant from SARS-CoV (about 79%) and MERS-CoV (about 50%).\n\n Phylogenetic analysis revealed that 2019-nCoV fell within the subgenus Sarbecovirus of the genus Betacoronavirus, with a relatively long branch length to its closest relatives bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21, and was genetically distinct from SARS-CoV.\n\n Notably, homology modelling revealed that 2019-nCoV had a similar receptor-binding domain structure to that of SARS-CoV, despite amino acid variation at some key residues.\n\n\nInterpretation\n2019-nCoV is sufficiently divergent from SARS-CoV to be considered a new human-infecting betacoronavirus.\n\n Although our phylogenetic analysis suggests that bats might be the original host of this virus, an animal sold at the seafood market in Wuhan might represent an intermediate host facilitating the emergence of the virus in humans.\n\n Importantly, structural analysis suggests that 2019-nCoV might be able to bind to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor in humans.\n\n The future evolution, adaptation, and spread of this virus warrant urgent investigation.\n\n\nFunding\nNational Key Research and Development Program of China, National Major Project for Control and

Cases were confirmed by real-time RT-PCR and were analysed for epidemiological, demographic, clinical, and radiological features and laboratory data.\n\n Outcomes were followed up until Jan 25, 2020.\nFindings\nOf the 99 patients with 2019-nCoV pneumonia, 49 (49%) had a history of exposure to the Huanan seafood market.\n\n The average age of the patients was 55·5 years (SD 13·1), including 67 men and 32 women.\n\n 2019-nCoV was detected in all patients by real-time RT-PCR.\n\n 50 (51%) patients had chronic diseases.\n\n Patients had clinical manifestations of fever (82 [83%] patients), cough (81 [82%] patients), shortness of breath (31 [31%] patients), muscle ache (11 [11%] patients), confusion (nine [9%] patients), headache (eight [8%] patients), sore throat (five [5%] patients), rhinorrhoea (four [4%] patients), chest pain (two [2%] patients), diarrhoea (two [2%] patients), and nausea and vomiting (one [1%] patient).\n\n According to imaging examination, 74 (75%) patients showed bilateral pneumonia, 14 (14%) patients showed multiple mottling and ground-glass opacity, and one (1%) patient had pneumothorax.\n\n 17 (17%) patients developed acute respiratory distress syndrome and, among them, 11 (11%) patients worsened in a short period of time and died of multiple organ failure.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe 2019-nCoV infection was of clustering onset, is more likely to affect older males with comorbidities, and can result in severe and even fatal respiratory diseases such as acute respiratory distress syndrome.\n\n In general, characteristics of patients who died were in line with the MuLBSTA score, an early warning model for predicting mortality in viral pneumonia.\n\n Further investigation is needed to explore the applicability of the MuLBSTA score in

Covid-19","abstract":"Background\nNo therapeutics have yet been proven effective for the treatment of severe illness caused by SARS-CoV-2.\nMethods\nWe conducted a randomized, controlled, open-label trial involving hospitalized adult patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, which causes the respiratory illness Covid-19, and an oxygen saturation (Sao2) of 94% or less while they were breathing ambient air or a ratio of the partial pressure of oxygen (Pao2) to the fraction of inspired oxygen (Fio2) of less than 300 mm Hg.\n\n Patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either lopinavir–ritonavir (400 mg and 100 mg, respectively) twice a day for 14 days, in addition to standard care, or standard care alone.\n\n The primary end point was the time to clinical improvement, defined as the time from randomization to either an improvement of two points on a seven-category ordinal scale or discharge from the hospital, whichever came first.\n\n\nResults\nA total of 199 patients with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection underwent randomization; 99 were assigned to the lopinavir–ritonavir group, and 100 to the standard-care group.\n\n Treatment with lopinavir–ritonavir was not associated with a difference from standard care in the time to clinical improvement (hazard ratio for clinical improvement, 1.24; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.90 to 1.72).\n\n Mortality at 28 days was similar in the lopinavir–ritonavir group and the standard-care group (19.2% vs.\n\n 25.0%; difference, ?5.8 percentage points; 95% CI, ?17.3 to 5.7).\n\n The percentages of patients with detectable viral RNA at various time points were similar.\n\n In a modified intention-to-treat analysis, lopinavir–ritonavir led to a median time to clinical improvement that was shorter by 1 day than that observed with standard care (hazard ratio, 1.39; 95% CI, 1.00 to 1.91).\n\n Gastrointestinal adverse events were more common in the lopinavir–ritonavir group, but serious adverse events were more common in the standard-care group.\n\n Lopinavir–ritonavir treatment was stopped early in 13 patients (13.8%) because of adverse events.\n\n\nConclusions\nIn hospitalized adult patients with severe Covid-19, no benefit was observed with lopinavir–ritonavir treatment beyond standard care.\n\n Future trials in patients with severe illness may help to confirm or exclude the possibility of a treatment benefit.\n\n (Funded by Major Projects of National Science and Technology on New Drug Creation and Development and others; Chinese Clinical Trial Register

Vitro Antiviral Activity and Projection of Optimized Dosing Design of Hydroxychloroquine for the Treatment of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)","abstract":"Background\nThe Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) first broke out in Wuhan (China) and subsequently spread worldwide.\n\n Chloroquine has been sporadically used in treating SARS-CoV-2 infection.\n\n Hydroxychloroquine shares the same mechanism of action as chloroquine, but its more tolerable safety profile makes it the preferred drug to treat malaria and autoimmune conditions.\n\n We propose that the immunomodulatory effect of hydroxychloroquine also may be useful in controlling the cytokine storm that occurs late-phase in critically ill SARS-CoV-2 infected patients.\n\n Currently, there is no evidence to support the use of hydroxychloroquine in SARS-CoV-2 infection.\n\n\nMethods\nThe pharmacological activity of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine was tested using SARS-CoV-2 infected Vero cells.\n\n Physiologically-based pharmacokinetic models (PBPK) were implemented for both drugs separately by integrating their in vitro data.\n\n Using the PBPK models, hydroxychloroquine concentrations in lung fluid were simulated under 5 different dosing regimens to explore the most effective regimen whilst considering the drug’s safety profile.\n\n\nResults\nHydroxychloroquine (EC50=0.72 ?M) was found to be more potent than chloroquine (EC50=5.47 ?M) in vitro.\n\n Based on PBPK models results, a loading dose of 400 mg twice daily of hydroxychloroquine sulfate given orally, followed by a maintenance dose of 200 mg given twice daily for 4 days is recommended for SARS-CoV-2 infection, as it reached three times the potency of chloroquine phosphate when given 500 mg twice daily 5 days in advance.\n\n\nConclusions\nHydroxychloroquine was found to be more potent than chloroquine to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7108130","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Oxford University

Covid-19","abstract":"Background\nNo therapeutics have yet been proven effective for the treatment of severe illness caused by SARS-CoV-2.\nMethods\nWe conducted a randomized, controlled, open-label trial involving hospitalized adult patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, which causes the respiratory illness Covid-19, and an oxygen saturation (Sao2) of 94% or less while they were breathing ambient air or a ratio of the partial pressure of oxygen (Pao2) to the fraction of inspired oxygen (Fio2) of less than 300 mm Hg.\n\n Patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either lopinavir–ritonavir (400 mg and 100 mg, respectively) twice a day for 14 days, in addition to standard care, or standard care alone.\n\n The primary end point was the time to clinical improvement, defined as the time from randomization to either an improvement of two points on a seven-category ordinal scale or discharge from the hospital, whichever came first.\n\n\nResults\nA total of 199 patients with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection underwent randomization; 99 were assigned to the lopinavir–ritonavir group, and 100 to the standard-care group.\n\n Treatment with lopinavir–ritonavir was not associated with a difference from standard care in the time to clinical improvement (hazard ratio for clinical improvement, 1.24; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.90 to 1.72).\n\n Mortality at 28 days was similar in the lopinavir–ritonavir group and the standard-care group (19.2% vs.\n\n 25.0%; difference, ?5.8 percentage points; 95% CI, ?17.3 to 5.7).\n\n The percentages of patients with detectable viral RNA at various time points were similar.\n\n In a modified intention-to-treat analysis, lopinavir–ritonavir led to a median time to clinical improvement that was shorter by 1 day than that observed with standard care (hazard ratio, 1.39; 95% CI, 1.00 to 1.91).\n\n Gastrointestinal adverse events were more common in the lopinavir–ritonavir group, but serious adverse events were more common in the standard-care group.\n\n Lopinavir–ritonavir treatment was stopped early in 13 patients (13.8%) because of adverse events.\n\n\nConclusions\nIn hospitalized adult patients with severe Covid-19, no benefit was observed with lopinavir–ritonavir treatment beyond standard care.\n\n Future trials in patients with severe illness may help to confirm or exclude the possibility of a treatment benefit.\n\n (Funded by Major Projects of National Science and Technology on New Drug Creation and Development and others; Chinese Clinical Trial Register

Covid-19","abstract":"Background\nRemdesivir, a nucleotide analogue prodrug that inhibits viral RNA polymerases, has shown in vitro activity against SARS-CoV-2.\nMethods\nWe provided remdesivir on a compassionate-use basis to patients hospitalized with Covid-19, the illness caused by infection with SARS-CoV-2. Patients were those with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection who had an oxygen saturation of 94% or less while they were breathing ambient air or who were receiving oxygen support.\n\n Patients received a 10-day course of remdesivir, consisting of 200 mg administered intravenously on day 1, followed by 100 mg daily for the remaining 9 days of treatment.\n\n This report is based on data from patients who received remdesivir during the period from January 25, 2020, through March 7, 2020, and have clinical data for at least 1 subsequent day.\n\n\nResults\nOf the 61 patients who received at least one dose of remdesivir, data from 8 could not be analyzed (including 7 patients with no post-treatment data and 1 with a dosing error).\n\n Of the 53 patients whose data were analyzed, 22 were in the United States, 22 in Europe or Canada, and 9 in Japan.\n\n At baseline, 30 patients (57%) were receiving mechanical ventilation and 4 (8%) were receiving extracorporeal membrane oxygenation.\n\n During a median follow-up of 18 days, 36 patients (68%) had an improvement in oxygen-support class, including 17 of 30 patients (57%) receiving mechanical ventilation who were extubated.\n\n A total of 25 patients (47%) were discharged, and 7 patients (13%) died; mortality was 18% (6 of 34) among patients receiving invasive ventilation and 5% (1 of 19) among those not receiving invasive ventilation.\n\n\nConclusions\nIn this cohort of patients hospitalized for severe Covid-19 who were treated with compassionate-use remdesivir, clinical improvement was observed in 36 of 53 patients (68%).\n\n Measurement of efficacy will require ongoing randomized, placebo-controlled trials of remdesivir therapy.\n\n (Funded by Gilead

samples and serum antibody responses during infection by SARS-CoV-2: an observational cohort study","abstract":"Background\nCoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) causes severe community and nosocomial outbreaks.\n\n Comprehensive data for serial respiratory viral load and serum antibody responses from patients infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) are not yet available.\n\n Nasopharyngeal and throat swabs are usually obtained for serial viral load monitoring of respiratory infections but gathering these specimens can cause discomfort for patients and put health-care workers at risk.\n\n We aimed to ascertain the serial respiratory viral load of SARS-CoV-2 in posterior oropharyngeal (deep throat) saliva samples from patients with COVID-19, and serum antibody responses.\n\n\nMethods\nWe did a cohort study at two hospitals in Hong Kong.\n\n We included patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19. We obtained samples of blood, urine, posterior oropharyngeal saliva, and rectal swabs.\n\n Serial viral load was ascertained by reverse transcriptase quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR).\n\n Antibody levels against the SARS-CoV-2 internal nucleoprotein (NP) and surface spike protein receptor binding domain (RBD) were measured using EIA.\n\n Whole-genome sequencing was done to identify possible mutations arising during infection.\n\n\nFindings\nBetween Jan 22, 2020, and Feb 12, 2020, 30 patients were screened for inclusion, of whom 23 were included (median age 62 years [range 37–75]).\n\n The median viral load in posterior oropharyngeal saliva or other respiratory specimens at presentation was 5·2 log10 copies per mL (IQR 4·1–7·0).\n\n Salivary viral load was highest during the first week after symptom onset and subsequently declined with time (slope ?0·15, 95% CI ?0·19 to ?0·11; R2=0·71).\n\n In one patient, viral RNA was detected 25 days after symptom onset.\n\n Older age was correlated with higher viral load (Spearman's ?=0·48, 95% CI 0·074–0·75; p=0·020).\n\n For 16 patients with serum samples available 14 days or longer after symptom onset, rates of seropositivity were 94% for anti-NP IgG (n=15), 88% for anti-NP IgM (n=14), 100% for anti-RBD IgG (n=16), and 94% for anti-RBD IgM (n=15).\n\n Anti-SARS-CoV-2-NP or anti-SARS-CoV-2-RBD IgG levels correlated with virus neutralisation titre (R2&gt;0·9).\n\n No genome mutations were detected on serial samples.\n\n\nInterpretation\nPosterior oropharyngeal saliva samples are a non-invasive specimen more acceptable to patients and health-care workers.\n\n Unlike severe acute respiratory syndrome, patients with COVID-19 had the highest viral load near presentation, which could account for the fast-spreading nature of this epidemic.\n\n This finding emphasises the importance of stringent infection control and early use of potent antiviral agents, alone or in combination, for high-risk individuals.\n\n Serological assay can complement RT-qPCR for diagnosis.\n\n\nFunding\nRichard and Carol Yu, May Tam Mak Mei Yin, The Shaw Foundation Hong Kong, Michael Tong, Marina Lee, Government Consultancy

lopinavir–ritonavir (400 mg and 100 mg, respectively) twice a day for 14 days, in addition to standard care, or standard care alone.\n\n The primary end point was the time to clinical improvement, defined as the time from randomization to either an improvement of two points on a seven-category ordinal scale or discharge from the hospital, whichever came first.\n\n\nResults\nA total of 199 patients with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection underwent randomization; 99 were assigned to the lopinavir–ritonavir group, and 100 to the standard-care group.\n\n Treatment with lopinavir–ritonavir was not associated with a difference from standard care in the time to clinical improvement (hazard ratio for clinical improvement, 1.24; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.90 to 1.72).\n\n Mortality at 28 days was similar in the lopinavir–ritonavir group and the standard-care group (19.2% vs.\n\n 25.0%; difference, ?5.8 percentage points; 95% CI, ?17.3 to 5.7).\n\n The percentages of patients with detectable viral RNA at various time points were similar.\n\n In a modified intention-to-treat analysis, lopinavir–ritonavir led to a median time to clinical improvement that was shorter by 1 day than that observed with standard care (hazard ratio, 1.39; 95% CI, 1.00 to 1.91).\n\n Gastrointestinal adverse events were more common in the lopinavir–ritonavir group, but serious adverse events were more common in the standard-care group.\n\n Lopinavir–ritonavir treatment was stopped early in 13 patients (13.8%) because of adverse events.\n\n\nConclusions\nIn hospitalized adult patients with severe Covid-19, no benefit was observed with lopinavir–ritonavir treatment beyond standard care.\n\n Future trials in patients with severe illness may help to confirm or exclude the possibility of a treatment benefit.\n\n (Funded by Major Projects of National Science and Technology on New Drug Creation and Development and others; Chinese Clinical Trial Register

an emerging coronavirus that has resulted in nearly 1,000,000 laboratory-confirmed cases including over 50,000 deaths.\n\n Although SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV share a number of common clinical manifestations, SARS-CoV-2 appears to be highly efficient in person-to-person transmission and frequently cause asymptomatic infections.\n\n However, the underlying mechanism that confers these viral characteristics on high transmissibility and asymptomatic infection remain incompletely understood.\n\n\nMethods\nWe comprehensively investigated the replication, cell tropism, and immune activation profile of SARS-CoV-2 infection in human lung tissues with SARS-CoV included as a comparison.\n\n\nResults\nSARS-CoV-2 infected and replicated in human lung tissues more efficiently than that of SARS-CoV.\n\n Within the 48-hour interval, SARS-CoV-2 generated 3.20 folds more infectious virus particles than that of SARS-CoV from the infected lung tissues (P&lt;0.024).\n\n SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV were similar in cell tropism, with both targeting types I and II pneumocytes, and alveolar macrophages.\n\n Importantly, despite the more efficient virus replication, SARS-CoV-2 did not significantly induce types I, II, or III interferons in the infected human lung tissues.\n\n In addition, while SARS-CoV infection upregulated the expression of 11 out of 13 (84.62%) representative pro-inflammatory cytokines/chemokines, SARS-CoV-2 infection only upregulated 5 of these 13 (38.46%) key inflammatory mediators despite replicating more efficiently.\n\n\nConclusions\nOur study provided the first quantitative data on the comparative replication capacity and immune activation profile of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV infection in human lung tissues.\n\n Our results provided important insights on the pathogenesis, high transmissibility, and asymptomatic infection of SARS-CoV-2.\n","id":"PMC7184390","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Oxford University

coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) started in December, 2019, in Wuhan, China.\n\n Information about critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection is scarce.\n\n We aimed to describe the clinical course and outcomes of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this single-centered, retrospective, observational study, we enrolled 52 critically ill adult patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia who were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) of Wuhan Jin Yin-tan hospital (Wuhan, China) between late December, 2019, and Jan 26, 2020. Demographic data, symptoms, laboratory values, comorbidities, treatments, and clinical outcomes were all collected.\n\n Data were compared between survivors and non-survivors.\n\n The primary outcome was 28-day mortality, as of Feb 9, 2020. Secondary outcomes included incidence of SARS-CoV-2-related acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and the proportion of patients requiring mechanical ventilation.\n\n\nFindings\nOf 710 patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, 52 critically ill adult patients were included.\n\n The mean age of the 52 patients was 59·7 (SD 13·3) years, 35 (67%) were men, 21 (40%) had chronic illness, 51 (98%) had fever.\n\n 32 (61·5%) patients had died at 28 days, and the median duration from admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) to death was 7 (IQR 3–11) days for non-survivors.\n\n Compared with survivors, non-survivors were older (64·6 years [11·2] vs 51·9 years [12·9]), more likely to develop ARDS (26 [81%] patients vs 9 [45%] patients), and more likely to receive mechanical ventilation (30 [94%] patients vs 7 [35%] patients), either invasively or non-invasively.\n\n Most patients had organ function damage, including 35 (67%) with ARDS, 15 (29%) with acute kidney injury, 12 (23%) with cardiac injury, 15 (29%) with liver dysfunction, and one (2%) with pneumothorax.\n\n 37 (71%) patients required mechanical ventilation.\n\n Hospital-acquired infection occurred in seven (13·5%) patients.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe mortality of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia is considerable.\n\n The survival time of the non-survivors is likely to be within 1–2 weeks after ICU

familial cluster of pneumonia associated with the 2019 novel coronavirus indicating person-to-person transmission: a study of a family cluster","abstract":"Background\nAn ongoing outbreak of pneumonia associated with a novel coronavirus was reported in Wuhan city, Hubei province, China.\n\n Affected patients were geographically linked with a local wet market as a potential source.\n\n No data on person-to-person or nosocomial transmission have been published to date.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this study, we report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, radiological, and microbiological findings of five patients in a family cluster who presented with unexplained pneumonia after returning to Shenzhen, Guangdong province, China, after a visit to Wuhan, and an additional family member who did not travel to Wuhan.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of genetic sequences from these patients were done.\n\n\nFindings\nFrom Jan 10, 2020, we enrolled a family of six patients who travelled to Wuhan from Shenzhen between Dec 29, 2019 and Jan 4, 2020. Of six family members who travelled to Wuhan, five were identified as infected with the novel coronavirus.\n\n Additionally, one family member, who did not travel to Wuhan, became infected with the virus after several days of contact with four of the family members.\n\n None of the family members had contacts with Wuhan markets or animals, although two had visited a Wuhan hospital.\n\n Five family members (aged 36–66 years) presented with fever, upper or lower respiratory tract symptoms, or diarrhoea, or a combination of these 3–6 days after exposure.\n\n They presented to our hospital (The University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen) 6–10 days after symptom onset.\n\n They and one asymptomatic child (aged 10 years) had radiological ground-glass lung opacities.\n\n Older patients (aged &gt;60 years) had more systemic symptoms, extensive radiological ground-glass lung changes, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and increased C-reactive protein and lactate dehydrogenase levels.\n\n The nasopharyngeal or throat swabs of these six patients were negative for known respiratory microbes by point-of-care multiplex RT-PCR, but five patients (four adults and the child) were RT-PCR positive for genes encoding the internal RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and surface Spike protein of this novel coronavirus, which were confirmed by Sanger sequencing.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these five patients' RT-PCR amplicons and two full genomes by next-generation sequencing showed that this is a novel coronavirus, which is closest to the bat severe acute respiatory syndrome (SARS)-related coronaviruses found in Chinese horseshoe bats.\n\n\nInterpretation\nOur findings are consistent with person-to-person transmission of this novel coronavirus in hospital and family settings, and the reports of infected travellers in other geographical regions.\n\n\nFunding\nThe Shaw Foundation Hong Kong, Michael Seak-Kan Tong, Respiratory Viral Research Foundation Limited, Hui

novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).\n\n We report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatment and clinical outcomes of these patients.\n\n\nMethods\nAll patients with suspected 2019-nCoV were admitted to a designated hospital in Wuhan.\n\n We prospectively collected and analysed data on patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection by real-time RT-PCR and next-generation sequencing.\n\n Data were obtained with standardised data collection forms shared by WHO and the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium from electronic medical records.\n\n Researchers also directly communicated with patients or their families to ascertain epidemiological and symptom data.\n\n Outcomes were also compared between patients who had been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and those who had not.\n\n\nFindings\nBy Jan 2, 2020, 41 admitted hospital patients had been identified as having laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection.\n\n Most of the infected patients were men (30 [73%] of 41); less than half had underlying diseases (13 [32%]), including diabetes (eight [20%]), hypertension (six [15%]), and cardiovascular disease (six [15%]).\n\n Median age was 49·0 years (IQR 41·0–58·0).\n\n 27 (66%) of 41 patients had been exposed to Huanan seafood market.\n\n One family cluster was found.\n\n Common symptoms at onset of illness were fever (40 [98%] of 41 patients), cough (31 [76%]), and myalgia or fatigue (18 [44%]); less common symptoms were sputum production (11 [28%] of 39), headache (three [8%] of 38), haemoptysis (two [5%] of 39), and diarrhoea (one [3%] of 38).\n\n Dyspnoea developed in 22 (55%) of 40 patients (median time from illness onset to dyspnoea 8·0 days [IQR 5·0–13·0]).\n\n 26 (63%) of 41 patients had lymphopenia.\n\n All 41 patients had pneumonia with abnormal findings on chest CT.\n\n Complications included acute respiratory distress syndrome (12 [29%]), RNAaemia (six [15%]), acute cardiac injury (five [12%]) and secondary infection (four [10%]).\n\n 13 (32%) patients were admitted to an ICU and six (15%) died.\n\n Compared with non-ICU patients, ICU patients had higher plasma levels of IL2, IL7, IL10, GSCF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNF?.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe 2019-nCoV infection caused clusters of severe respiratory illness similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and was associated with ICU admission and high mortality.\n\n Major gaps in our knowledge of the origin, epidemiology, duration of human transmission, and clinical spectrum of disease need fulfilment by future studies.\n\n\nFunding\nMinistry of Science and Technology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, National Natural Science Foundation of China,

injury.\n However, it is not clear whether upregulation of the ACE2/Ang–(1–7)/Mas axis prevents LPS–induced injury in pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells (PMVECs) by inhibiting the MAPKs/NF–?B pathways.\n Primary cultured rat PMVECs were transduced with lentiviral–borne Ace2 or shRNA–Ace2, and then treated or not with Mas receptor blocker (A779) before exposure to LPS.\n LPS stimulation resulted in the higher levels of AngII, Ang–(1–7), cytokine secretion, and apoptosis rates, and the lower ACE2/ACE ratio.\n Ace2 reversed the ACE2/ACE imbalance and increased Ang–(1–7) levels, thus reducing LPS–induced apoptosis and inflammation, while inhibition of Ace2 reversed all these effects.\n A779 abolished these protective effects of Ace2.\n LPS treatment was associated with activation of the ERK, p38, JNK, and NF–?B pathways, which were aggravated by A779. Pretreatment with A779 prevented the Ace2–induced blockade of p38, JNK, and NF–?B phosphorylation.\n However, only JNK inhibitor markedly reduced apoptosis and cytokine secretion in PMVECs with Ace2 deletion and A779 pretreatment.\n These results suggest that the ACE2/Ang–(1–7)/Mas axis has a crucial role in preventing LPS–induced apoptosis and inflammation of PMVECs, by inhibiting the JNK/NF–?B pathways.\n","id":"PMC4314638","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Nature Publishing Group","authors":[{"firstname":"Yingchuan","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Yongmei","surname":"Cao","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Zhen","surname":"Zeng","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Mengfan","surname":"Liang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Ying","surname":"Xue","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Caihua","surname":"Xi","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Ming","surname":"Zhou","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Wei","surname":"Jiang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.21037/atm.2016.11.03","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Treating the host response to emerging virus diseases: lessons learned from sepsis, pneumonia, influenza and Ebola","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1128/mBio.00716-15","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Treating the Host Response to Ebola Virus Disease with Generic Statins and Angiotensin Receptor Blockers","abstract":"Treatments targeting the Ebola virus may eventually be shown to work, but they will not have an impact on overall Ebola mortality in West Africa.\n Endothelial dysfunction is responsible for the fluid and electrolyte imbalances seen in Ebola patients.\n Because inexpensive generic statins and angiotensin receptor blockers restore endothelial barrier integrity, they can be used to treat the host response in these patients.\n In Sierra Leone, approximately 100 Ebola patients were treated with this combination, and reports indicate that survival was greatly improved.\n","id":"PMC4479704","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"American Society of Microbiology","authors":[{"firstname":"David S.","surname":"Fedson","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Jeffrey R.","surname":"Jacobson","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Ole Martin","surname":"Rordam","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Steven M.","surname":"Opal","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"10.1016/j.ijid.2015.04.019","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Treating Ebola patients: a 'bottom up' approach using generic statins and angiotensin receptor blockers","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1056/NEJMoa1910993","date":"1970-01-01","title":"A randomized, controlled trial of Ebola virus disease therapeutics","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1016/S1473-3099(19)30484-0","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Treating Ebola in eastern DRC","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1002/path.2987","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Acute respiratory distress syndrome leads to reduced ratio of ACE/ACE2 activities and is prevented by angiotensin-(1-7) or an angiotensin II receptor antagonist","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1016/j.bcp.2014.11.013","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Tissue specific up regulation of ACE2 in rabbit model of atherosclerosis by atorvastatin: role of epigenetic histone modifications","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1097/PCC.0b013e3182a55735","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Imbalance between pulmonary angiotensin-converting enzyme and angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 activity in acute respiratory distress syndrome","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1016/j.antiviral.2011.10.019","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Do viral infections mimic bacterial sepsis?

causes a mild and self-limiting illness known as Zika fever, which often is accompanied by maculopapular rash, headache, and myalgia.\n\n During the current outbreak in South America, ZIKV infection during pregnancy has been hypothesized to cause microcephaly and other diseases.\n\n The detection of ZIKV in fetal brain tissue supports this hypothesis.\n\n Because human infections with ZIKV historically have remained sporadic and, until recently, have been limited to small-scale epidemics, neither the disease caused by ZIKV nor the molecular determinants of virulence and/or pathogenicity have been well characterized.\n\n Here, we describe a small animal model for wild-type ZIKV of the Asian lineage.\n\n\nMethodology/Principal Findings\nUsing mice deficient in interferon ?/? and ? receptors (AG129 mice), we report that these animals were highly susceptible to ZIKV infection and disease, succumbing within seven to eight days.\n\n Rapid viremic dissemination was observed in visceral organs and brain; but only was associated with severe pathologies in the brain and muscle.\n\n Finally, these results were consistent across challenge routes, age of mice, and inoculum doses.\n\n These data represent a mouse model for ZIKV that is not dependent on adapting ZIKV to intracerebral passage in mice.\n\n\nConclusions/Significance\nFoot pad injection of AG129 mice with ZIKV represents a biologically relevant model for studying ZIKV infection and disease development following wild-type virus inoculation without the requirement for adaptation of the virus or intracerebral delivery of the virus.\n\n This newly developed Zika disease model can be exploited to identify determinants of ZIKV virulence and reveal molecular mechanisms that control the virus-host interaction, providing a framework for rational design of acute phase therapeutics and for vaccine efficacy testing.\n\n\n","id":"PMC4836712","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Public

increased in serum of ZIKV-infected mice.\n Interestingly, the virus was also detected in testicles of infected mice.\n In line with its in vitro anti-ZIKV activity, 7DMA reduced viremia and delayed virus-induced morbidity and mortality in infected mice, which also validates this small animal model to assess the in vivo efficacy of novel ZIKV inhibitors.\n Since AG129 mice can generate an

randomized controlled trial","abstract":"Objectives\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n The majority of patients experience asymptomatic to mild self-limited disease, but some cases progress to respiratory and multi-organ failure.\n\n However, so far, no approved antiviral therapy has been available for treatment of COVID-19.

The majority of patients experience asymptomatic to mild self-limited disease, but some cases progress to respiratory and multi-organ failure. However, so far, no approved antiviral therapy has been available for treatment of COVID-19. Sofosbuvir/velpatasvir (SOF/VEL) is an approved anti-HCV drug that is capable of suppressing other families of positive-sense RNA viruses with conserved polymerase and may be effective against SARS-CoV-2. This study was conducted to evaluate the efficacy of the SOF/VEL combination in addition to the national standard of care versus the national standard of care alone (hydroxychloroquine and lopinavir/ritonavir as well as supportive care) in patients with moderate to severe COVID-19 infection.\nMethods\nThis single-centre, randomized, open-labelled, prospective clinical trial was done in patients with moderate to severe COVID-19 admitted to Farabi Hospital in Kermanshah Province, Iran. Eligible patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to the SOF/VEL arm (SOF/VEL plus the national standard of care) or the control arm (the national standard of care alone). The main outcome of the study was the mortality on Day 28 after randomization. Secondary outcomes were time from the start of medication to clinical improvement, hospital length of stay, need for mechanical ventilation, duration of mechanical ventilation and conversion of RT-PCR results from positive to negative from the time of randomization to discharge. Adverse events were evaluated in all patients who started their assigned treatment.\nResults\nBetween 11 April and 8 June 2020, 80 patients were recruited and randomly assigned into the SOF/VEL (n = 40) and control (n = 40) arms. The primary outcome was not significantly different between the two arms (P = 1.00). Secondary outcomes, including time to clinical improvement, hospital length of stay, need for mechanical ventilation, duration of mechanical ventilation and RT-PCR conversion, were not significantly different between arms either (P &gt; 0.05). SOF/VEL treatment and the national standard of care were tolerated similarly.\nConclusions\nAlthough treatment with SOF/VEL was safe, adding SOF/VEL to the standard of care did not improve the clinical status or reduce mortality in patients with moderate to severe COVID-19. However, larger randomized clinical trials including more parameters are needed for accurate estimation of the efficacy of SOF/VEL.\nIntroduction\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was first reported in Wuhan, China on 31 December 2019. Since then, a significant number of people have been infected with the virus. However, extensive studies have shown that none of the potential drugs are effective for treatment of COVID-19. A rapid increase in the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 has prompted countries around the world to take immediate action to design therapeutic interventions or develop effective vaccines to prevent or treat COVID-19. The treatments that are currently in use include repurposed drugs, like antiviral drugs, antiparasitic drugs and anti-inflammatory drugs, as well as monoclonal antibodies.\nSARS-CoV-2 belongs to the family of betacoronaviruses. This family has other members, including Middle East respiratory syndrome human coronavirus (MERS-HCoV) and severe acute respiratory syndrome human coronavirus (SARS-HCoV). HCoVs are a group of positive-sense single-stranded RNA (+ ssRNA) viruses that are very long (30 000 bp), characterized by two groups of proteins: non-structural proteins like RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) (nsp12) and structural proteins, like matrix, envelope, spike and nucleocapsid. RdRp is an enzyme with a significant effect on the life cycle of RNA viruses, including coronaviruses.\nHCV and Flaviviridae, like MERS and SARS-CoV-2 coronaviruses, are + ssRNA viruses that have similar replication mechanisms requiring RdRp. Therefore, it is possible that HIV or HCV and other Flaviviridae nucleoside/nucleotide analogues such as azithromycin, remdesivir and sofosbuvir could bind strongly to SARS-CoV-2 RdRp. A recent preliminary in silico study developed a SARS-CoV-2 RdRp model using homology modelling and sequence analysis. It was targeted using antipolymerase drugs, such as ribavirin and sofosbuvir. The available data indicated the theoretical efficacy of ribavirin and sofosbuvir for treatment of the new coronavirus.\nVelpatasvir is also an inhibitor that targets the HCV NS5A protein. There are recent reports of the inhibitory activity of velpatasvir tailored to A chain and B chain active sites of the coronavirus 3C-like protease (3CLpro). Two-component HCV drugs (sofosbuvir/velpatasvir) may be well-favoured candidates for a repurposing application because they may inhibit two coronavirus enzymes. This combined drug targeting two viral proteins decreases development of resistance by the virus. Direct-acting antiviral drugs are also associated with very few side effects and are easily administered orally. This study was conducted to evaluate the efficacy of the sofosbuvir/velpatasvir combination plus the national standard of care in adult patients hospitalized with moderate to severe COVID-19 infection.\nMaterials and methods\nStudy design and patients\nThis single-centre, open-labelled, randomized clinical trial was conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of oral sofosbuvir/velpatasvir as a fixed-dose combination in adult patients hospitalized with moderate to severe COVID-19 in Farabi Hospital, Kermanshah, Iran from 11 April to 8 June 2020. Because of the emergency nature of the trial, placebos of sofosbuvir/velpatasvir were not prepared. The patients were evaluated for eligibility based on a positive RT-PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 on a nasopharyngeal swab and/or a compatible chest CT scan. Individuals 18 years of age or older were eligible if they had an oxygen saturation (SaO2) of 93% or less in ambient air and/or an absolute lymphocyte count of &lt;1.1 x 109 cells/L. Exclusion criteria were pregnancy and breastfeeding, a physician's decision against enrolment, conditions that did not allow complete implementation of the protocol, allergy or hypersensitivity to the drugs used in this trial, severe liver disease (e.g. cirrhosis or an ALT or AST level &gt;5 times the upper limit of the normal range), use of medications that are contraindicated with the drugs used in this trial, known HIV infection (due to concerns about resistance to lopinavir/ritonavir if used without combination with other antiviral agents) and known HCV infection (due to concerns about resistance to sofosbuvir/velpatasvir due to short-term use of this drug). Patients who were unable to swallow received oral medications through a nasogastric tube.\nSample size\nAlthough there were different outcomes in which the researchers were interested, it was decided to calculate the sample size based on the length of hospital stay. It was postulated that the real difference between the two groups was only 1 day. Therefore, the sample size was calculated assuming a 1 day difference between the two study arms with an SD of 1.5 days. To reject the null hypothesis that the population means of the sofosbuvir/velpatasvir and national standard of care arms were equal with a probability of 0.8, the number of patients was estimated as 36 for each arm. The probability of type I error associated with the test for the null hypothesis was 0.05.\nRandomization and allocation\nThe participants were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio. In order to generate an allocation sequence, simple random allocation was applied using an Excel file; 80 eligible patients were enrolled in the study (40 individuals in each group). For allocation sequence concealment, the study arm for each patient was contained in a sealed envelope labelled with a number from 1 to 80.\nProcedures\nThe intervention arm received a fixed-dose combination tablet containing 400 mg sofosbuvir and 100 mg velpatasvir (Shari Pharmaceutical Industry Co., Tehran, Iran) orally once daily for 10 days plus the national standard of care. The comparator arm only received the national standard of care including 400 mg hydroxychloroquine as a single dose and lopinavir/ritonavir (400 mg/100 mg) orally twice daily for 10 days as well as supplemental oxygen, non-invasive and invasive ventilation, antimicrobials, vasopressors and corticosteroids, if needed.\nEthics\nWritten informed consent was obtained from all patients, or their legal representatives if they were unable to provide consent. The protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee of Kermanshah University of Medical Sciences, Iran on 3 March 2020 (reference IR.KUMS.REC.1399.044). The study has been registered in the Iranian Registry of Clinical Trials (IRCT ID: IRCT20130812014333N145; https://www.irct.ir/trial/46790).\nClinical and laboratory monitoring\nNasopharyngeal swab samples were obtained on Day 1 (before the drugs were administered) and at the time of discharge for qualitative SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR. The patients were visited daily by an infectious disease specialist and their treatment was carefully managed. Moreover, they were assessed every day by trained nurses using daily record cards and flowsheets that captured data on six-stage saturation status and safety from Day 1 to hospital discharge or death. If a patient was discharged before 28 days from enrolment, the patient's health status was monitored by phone on the twenty-eighth day in terms of survival or death. The six-stage saturation status consisted of the following stages: (1) SaO2 &gt; 93%, not requiring supplemental oxygen; (2) SaO2 88%-93%, requiring supplemental oxygen at 4 L/min using a nasal cannula; (3) SaO2 85%-87%, requiring supplemental oxygen at 6-10 L/min using a face mask; (4) SaO2 80%-84%, requiring supplemental oxygen at 10-15 L/min with a reservoir bag; (5) SaO2 &lt; 80%, requiring non-invasive mechanical ventilation; and (6) SaO2 &lt; 80%, requiring invasive mechanical ventilation. Other clinical and laboratory data were recorded on paper files and then re-entered into an Excel file by the trial staff. Safety was monitored and recorded according to Good Clinical Practice guidelines.\nOutcomes\nThe main outcome of the study was the mortality on Day 28 after randomization. Secondary outcomes were: time from enrolment to clinical improvement, defined as a decline of two stages in the six-stage saturation status, or hospital discharge, whichever occurred earlier; hospital length of stay; need for mechanical ventilation; duration of mechanical ventilation; and conversion of RT-PCR results from positive to negative from the time of randomization to discharge. Adverse events were evaluated in all patients who started their assigned treatment. Safety outcomes included adverse events during treatment, serious adverse events and early discontinuation of treatment.\nStatistical analysis\nContinuous variables, expressed as mean (SD) and median (IQR), were compared using the independent samples t-test and the Mann-Whitney test. The Shapiro-Wilk test was applied to evaluate the normal distribution of the data in each group. Categorical variables, presented as number (%), were compared using the chi-squared test. Moreover, Fisher's exact test was applied in the case of data sparsity. Using the Cox proportional hazards model, adjusted for time from starting symptoms to admission time, HRs with 95% CIs were calculated for time to clinical improvement and length of hospital stay. Stata software version 14 was used for statistical analysis. In the course of analysis, impossible range data and outliers were taken into consideration. P &lt; 0.05 was considered as statistically significant. The proportional hazards assumption was confirmed.\nResults\nPatients\nAs Figure 1 shows, 59 of 139 patients with COVID-19 were excluded from the study for various reasons. Eighty patients were assigned to sofosbuvir/velpatasvir (sofosbuvir/velpatasvir plus the national standard of care) and control (only the national standard of care) arms in a 1:1 ratio. After randomization, one patient in the sofosbuvir/velpatasvir arm died before receiving the sofosbuvir/velpatasvir treatment and three patients in the control arm received sofosbuvir/velpatasvir at the physician's discretion. All of the hospitalized patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection were diagnosed according to the clinical signs/symptoms along with the radiographic findings. In addition, 59 (73.7%) patients had a positive RT-PCR test for SARS-CoV-2.\nRandomization and treatment assignment.\nThe mean of age of the participants was 54.1 +- 17.8 years. The male to female ratio was 1:1 and 1.2:1 in the sofosbuvir/velpatasvir and control arms, respectively; however, no statistically significant difference was observed (P = 0.36). The median time from the onset of symptoms to the start of the study treatment in the intervention and control groups was 7 (IQR 4-10) and 6 (IQR 4-10) days, respectively (P = 0.22). Hypertension (30%), diabetes mellitus (20%), cardiovascular diseases (17.5%) and pulmonary disorders (10%) were the most common comorbidities, respectively. No significant difference was observed between the groups in other treatments received (including antibiotics or corticosteroids). Also, there was no significant difference in terms of other demographic and clinical characteristics between the arms, except for the rate of anorexia (P = 0.02), the median of WBC count (P = 0.05), AST (P = 0.04) and creatinine levels (P = 0.02).\nThe demographic and clinical characteristics of the participants are represented in Table 1.\nDemographic, clinical and laboratory characteristics of the patients at baseline in the ITT population\nCharacteristics	All patients	Sofosbuvir/velpatasvir (n = 40)	Control (n = 40)	P valuea	 	Age (years), mean +- SD	54.1 +- 17.8	53.6 +- 16.3	54.6 +- 19.4	0.81	 	Male sex, n (%)	44 (55)	20 (50)	24 (60.0)	0.36	 	Had contact history, n (%)	15 (18.8)	7 (17.5)	8 (20)	0.96	 	Positive RT-PCR, n (%)	59 (73.7)	30 (75.0)	29 (72.5)	0.94	 	Time from starting symptoms to admission (days), median (IQR)	7 (4-10)	7 (4-10)	6 (4-10)	0.22	 	Corticosteroid use, n (%)	10 (12.5)	3 (7.5)	7 (17.5)	0.31	 	Antibiotic use, n (%)	75 (95.0)	37 (92.5)	39 (97.5)	0.30	 	Comorbidities, n (%)					 	 Hypertension	24 (30)	9 (22.5)	15 (37.5)	0.22	 	 Diabetes	16 (20)	10 (25)	6 (15)	0.40	 	 Cardiovascular disease	14 (17.5)	4 (10)	10 (25)	0.06	 	 Pulmonary disorders	8 (10)	4 (10)	4 (10)	1.00	 	 Others	11 (13.7)	6 (15.0)	5 (12.5)	0.74	 	Chief complaint, n (%)					 	 Anorexia	58 (72.5)	34 (85)	24 (60)	0.02	 	 Cough	57 (71.2)	27 (67.5)	30 (75)	0.62	 	 Chills	54 (67.5)	29 (72.5)	25 (62.5)	0.47	 	 Fever	52 (65)	27 (67)	25 (62.5)	0.81	 	Vital signs, median (IQR)					 	 Temperature ( C)	37 (36.5-37.4)	37 (36.5-37.3)	37 (36.6-37.4)	0.80	 	 Systolic blood pressure (mmHg)	120 (110-130)	120 (110-130)	120 (110-130)	0.98	 	 Respiratory rate (breaths/min)	18 (18-19)	18 (18-19)	18 (18-19)	0.79	 	 Pulse rate (beats/min)	87 (80-93)	84 (80-94)	87.5 (84-93)	0.80	 	 O2 saturation (%)	92 (88-94)	93 (90-94)	91 (86.5-93)	0.09	 	Complete blood count					 	 WBC count (cells/L), median (IQR)	6.8 (4.9-11.6) x 109	5.65 (4.1-8.6) x 109	7.5 (6.5-12) x 109	0.05b	 	  &gt;10 x 109, n (%)	27 (33.7)	10 (25.0)	17 (42.5)		 	  4-10 x 109, n (%)	41 (51.3)	21 (52.5)	20 (50.0)		 	  &lt;4 x 109, n (%)	12 (15.0)	9 (22.5)	3 (7.5)		 	 Lymphocyte count (cells/L), median (IQR)	1.2 (0.9-1.7) x 109	1.1 (0.9-1.6) x 109	1.3 (1.0-2.0) x 109	0.61b	 	  &gt;=1.1 x 109, n (%)	53 (66.3)	21 (52.5)	32 (80.0)		 	  &lt;1.1 x 109, n (%)	27 (33.7)	19 (47.5)	8 (20.0)		 	 Platelet count (cells/L), median (IQR)	193 (135-227) x 109	185.5 (132-219) x 109	206 (160-284) x 109	0.20b	 	  &gt;=100 x 109, n (%)	73 (91.2)	36 (90.0)	37 (92.5)		 	  &lt;100 x 109, n (%)	7 (8.8)	4 (10.0)	3 (7.5)		 	 Haemoglobin (g/dL), median (IQR)	14 (12.9-15.8)	13.75 (13-15.2)	14.1 (12.8-16.3)	0.32	 	Biochemical parameters					 	 Fasting blood sugar (mg/dL), median (IQR)	116 (101-142.5)	114.5 (102-141.5)	120 (99.5-146.5)	1.00b	 	  &gt;=126, n (%)	32 (40.0)	14 (35.0)	18 (45.0)		 	  &lt;126, n (%)	48 (60.0)	26 (65.0)	22 (55.0)		 	 Creatinine (mg/dL), median (IQR)	1 (0.9-1.1)	1 (0.8-1)	1.04 (1-1.2)	0.02$	 	  &gt;=1.5, n (%)	9 (11.2)	4 (10.0)	5 (12.5)		 	  &lt;1.5, n (%)	71 (88.8)	36 (90.0)	35 (87.5)		 	 AST (U/L), median (IQR)	29 (22-39)	25 (19-41)	26.5 (22-37)	0.04b	 	  &lt;=30, n (%)	40 (50.0)	32 (80.0)	16 (40.0)		 	  &gt;30, n (%)	22 (50.0)	8 (20.0)	24 (60.0)		 	 ALT (U/L), median (IQR)	25 (19-41)	32 (22-43)	24.5 (18.5-42.5)	0.90b	 	  &lt;=30, n (%)	61 (76.3)	24(60.0)	29 (72.5)		 	  &gt;30, n (%)	19 (23.2)	16 (40.0)	11 (27.5)		 	 Creatine kinase (U/L), median (IQR)	102 (69-182)	123 (70-169)	94 (46.5-193.5)	0.96b	 	  &gt;=185, n (%)	28 (35.0)	11 (27.5)	17 (42.5)		 	  &lt;185, n (%)	52 (65.0)	29 (72.5)	23 (57.5)		 	 Lactate dehydrogenase (U/L), median (IQR)	429 (321-574)	413 (315-533)	458.5 (360-624)	0.40b	 	  &gt;=245, n (%)	78 (97.5)	38 (95.0)	40 (100.0)		 	  &lt;245, n (%)	2 (2.5)	2 (5.0)	0 (0.0)		 	 Triglycerides (mg/dL), median (IQR)	118.5 (79.5-157)	117 (77-171)	120.5 (80-146)	0.80b	 	  &gt;=200, n (%)	23 (28.8)	11 (27.5)	12 (30.0)		 	  150-200, n (%)	7 (8.7)	6 (15.0)	1 (2.5)		 	  &lt;150, n (%)	50 (62.5)	23 (57.5)	27 (67.5)		 	 Ferritin (ng/mL), median (IQR)	412 (170-674)	444.2 (244.5-595)	356 (148.1-698)	0.31b	 	  &gt;=300, n (%)	62 (77.5)	32 (80.0)	30 (75.0)		 	  &lt;300, n (%)	18 (22.5)	8 (20.0)	10 (25.0)		 	 D-dimer (ng/mL), median (IQR)	891 (669-2288)	860 (579-2280)	1100 (701-2546)	0.67b	 	  &gt;=250, n (%)	75 (93.8)	35 (87.5)	40 (100.0)		 	  &lt;250, n (%)	5 (6.2)	5 (12.5)	0 (0.0)		 	 Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ng/mL), median (IQR)	30 (17-45)	27 (18-45)	32 (15-42)	0.81b	 	  &gt;=30, n (%)	47 (58.8)	21 (52.5)	26 (65.0)		 	  &lt;30, n (%)	33 (41.2)	19 (47.5)	14 (35.0)		 	\n\nP value less than 0.05 (typically &lt;=0.05) is statistically significant.\n\nP values are expressed to compare statistical differences between the medians of two groups.\nPrimary outcome\nAs a primary outcome, for the intention-to-treat (ITT) population, the 28 day mortality rate in the sofosbuvir/velpatasvir and control arms was the same (three cases in each arm, 7.5%). For the modified ITT population, the mortality rate was numerically lower in the sofosbuvir/velpatasvir arm (5.1%) compared with the control arm (7.5%); however, the difference was not statistically significant. There were two cases of out-of-hospital deaths during the 28 day follow-up (one case in each arm). Besides, all deaths occurred among male patients and the mean age of the deceased was 61.3 +- 6.3 years. All of the cases had at least one pre-existing condition and comorbidities.\nSecondary outcomes\nThe median time to clinical improvement within 28 days was shorter in the sofosbuvir/velpatasvir arm compared with the control arm [6 (IQR 4-8) versus 7 (IQR 4-11) days]. The HR for clinical improvement was estimated to be 1.2 (95% CI 0.6-2.2); however, the difference was not statistically significant (P = 0.30). Furthermore, results for the modified ITT population were not statistically different. Figure 2 shows the probability of clinical improvement within 28 days for the two trial arms.\nProbability of clinical improvement in the ITT population.\nAnother secondary outcome was the length of hospital stay. The median length of hospital stay was 6 (IQR 5-8.5) days for the ITT population in the sofosbuvir/velpatasvir arm, which was shorter than the 7 (IQR 5-13) days hospital stay in the control arm (Figure 3). The HR was 1.6 (95% CI 0.9-2.5); P = 0.25. For the modified ITT population, the median length of hospital stay was 6 (IQR 5-9) days in the sofosbuvir/velpatasvir arm and 7 (IQR 5-13) days in the control arm (HR 1.6; 95% CI 0.9-2.5; P = 0.89). For the ITT population, one patient in the sofosbuvir/velpatasvir arm (2.4%) and three patients in the control arm (8.1%) needed invasive mechanical ventilation (P = 0.61). Other secondary outcomes, such as duration of mechanical ventilation and conversion of nasopharyngeal swab RT-PCR result were not significantly different between the two arms; P = 0.51 and 0.49, respectively (Table 2).\nNumber of patients discharged by time in the ITT population.\nOutcomes in the ITT population\nOutcome of interest	Total	Sofosbuvir/velpatasvir (n = 40)	Control (n = 40)	P value	HRa	 	All-cause mortality, n (%)	6 (7.5)	3(7.5)	3 (7.5)	1.00		 	Time to clinical improvement (days), median (IQR)	6 (4-9.5)	6 (4-8)	7 (4-11)	0.30	1.2 (0.6-2.2)	 	Clinical improvement, n (%)						 	 Day 3	10 (12.5)	4 (10)	6(15)	0.49		 	 Day 5	22 (27.5)	12 (30)	10 (25)	0.61		 	 Day 7	44 (55)	23 (57.5)	21 (52.5)	0.65		 	Duration of hospital stay (days), median (IQR)	7 (5-11.5)	6 (5-8.5)	7 (5-13)	0.25	1.6 (0.9-2.5)	 	Time from randomization to death (days), median (IQR)	6 (7-9)	6 (2-9)	7 (7-30)	0.38		 	Need for mechanical ventilation, n (%)	4 (5.0)	1 (2.4)	3 (8.1)	0.61		 	Duration of mechanical ventilation (days), median (IQR)	2 (1-3)	3 (3-3)	1 (1-1)	0.51		 	RT-PCR conversion (positive to negative), n (%)	10 (12.5)	6 (15)	4 (10)	0.49		 	\nThe HR was estimated by the Cox proportional-risk model adjusted for time from starting symptoms to admission time.\nIn the ITT population, the median time from randomization to death was shorter in the sofosbuvir/velpatasvir arm compared with the control arm [6 (IQR 2-9) versus 7 (IQR 7-30) days; P = 0.38]. The median time to death was 7.5 (IQR 6-9) and 7 (IQR 7-30) days for the modified ITT population in the sofosbuvir/velpatasvir arm and the control arm, respectively.\nFor subgroup analysis, the patients in both arms were divided into two groups: those who received treatment within 7 days of the onset of symptoms and those who received it after 7 days. Based on the results, in patients who received treatment within 7 days of the onset of symptoms, the median time to clinical improvement was 6 (IQR 5-9) days in the sofosbuvir/velpatasvir arm and 6 (IQR 4-10) days in the control arm, indicating no significant difference (P = 0.85). Moreover, the median time to clinical improvement was 5.5 (IQR 4-8) and 8 (IQR 6-11) days in patients who received sofosbuvir/velpatasvir and patients who received only the national standard of care after 7 days of the onset of symptoms, respectively, but the difference was not statistically significant (P = 0.20). These analyses were repeated for hospital stay and time to death, but no significant differences were observed (P = 0.20).\nSafety evaluation\nAdverse events were not reported by 12 of 42 patients (27.9%) in the sofosbuvir/velpatasvir arm and 14 of 37 patients (37.8%) in the control arm during the study (Table 3). The most common adverse events in the sofosbuvir/velpatasvir arm were nausea and vomiting (18.6%), diarrhoea (9.3%) and headache (4.7%), compared with nausea and vomiting (18.9%), headache (8.1%) and diarrhoea (2.7%) in the control arm. A significantly higher incidence of diarrhoea was observed in the sofosbuvir/velpatasvir arm compared with the control arm [4 of 42 (9.3%) versus 1 of 37 (2.7%); P &lt; 0.001]. There were no significant differences in the incidence of other adverse events between the arms. In addition, no apparent differences in biochemistry laboratory abnormalities were seen between the arms (Table 3).\nAdverse events in the modified ITT population\nVariable	Total	Sofosbuvir/velpatasvir (n = 42)	Control (n = 37)	P valuea	 	Adverse events, n (%)					 	 No adverse drug reaction	26 (32.5)	12 (27.9)	14 (37.8)	0.34	 	 Nausea and vomiting	15 (18.7)	8 (18.6)	7 (18.9)	0.55	 	 Diarrhoea	5 (6.25)	4 (9.3)	1 (2.7)	&lt;0.001	 	 Headache	5 (6.2)	2 (4.7)	3 (8.1)	0.16	 	 Discontinued drug	1 (1.2)	0 (0.0)	1 (2.7)	0.31	 	 More than one drug reaction	28 (35.0)	17 (39.5)	11 (29.7)	0.16	 	Haematological adverse events, n (%)					 	 Leucopenia (&lt;4 x 109 cells/L)	10 (12.5)	7 (16.3)	3 (8.1)	0.31	 	 Lymphopenia (&lt;1.1 x 109 cells/L)	21 (26.3)	11 (29.7)	10 (23.3)	0.79	 	 Thrombocytopenia (&lt;100 x 109 cells/L)	9 (11.2)	4 (9.3)	5 (13.5)	1.00	 	 Haemoglobin decreased by &gt;1 g/dL	33 (38.8)	14 (35.0)	19 (42.2)	0.49	 	Biochemical laboratory abnormalities, n (%)					 	 Increased AST (&gt;60 U/L)	18 (22.5)	10 (23.3)	8 (21.7)	0.86	 	 Increased ALT (&gt;60 U/L)	11 (13.7)	9 (21.0)	8 (21.6)	0.94	 	 Increased triglycerides (increase of &gt;100 mg/dL relative to last measurement)	7 (8.8)	2 (5.0)	5 (12.5)	0.37	 	 Increased creatinine (increase of &gt;0.5 mg/dL relative to last measurement)	1 (1.2)	0 (0.0)	1 (2.5)	:	 	\n\nP value less than 0.05 (typically &lt;=0.05) is statistically significant.\nDiscussion\nAs stated earlier, there are no specific treatments for COVID-19 as yet, though a number are under evaluation, including experimental antivirals. SARS-CoV-2 RdRp especially is very likely to be effectively inhibited by sofosbuvir (which is capable of suppressing other families of positive-strand RNA viruses: Flaviviridae and Togaviridae). More importantly, sofosbuvir is safe and well tolerated at 400 mg (and even at 1200 mg) daily in a 24 week therapeutic regimen. The active metabolite of sofosbuvir, however, shows an extremely high intracellular stability, so it is hypothesized that SARS-CoV-2 infection in vivo could also be susceptible to sofosbuvir; on the other hand, the inhibitory activity of velpatasvir tailored to A chain and B chain active sites of the coronavirus 3CLpro has been reported, so we were convinced to design and run the current clinical trial study to evaluate the efficacy of a combination of sofosbuvir and velpatasvir plus the national standard of care in adult patients hospitalized with moderate to severe COVID-19 infection.\nIn our trial, the addition of sofosbuvir/velpatasvir to the current national standard of care did not result in a significant reduction in the 28 day mortality rate in patients admitted to hospital with moderate to severe COVID-19. Furthermore, patients in the sofosbuvir/velpatasvir arm had an almost similar mortality, time to clinical improvement, duration of hospital stay, RT-PCR conversion, need for mechanical ventilation and time free from mechanical ventilation compared with patients in the control arm.\nWe used the current FDA-approved dosing for HCV treatment (400 mg sofosbuvir and 100 mg velpatasvir orally once daily for 10 days). Though the fixed-dose combination sofosbuvir/velpatasvir for treatment of a hepatotropic virus has been designed/developed to facilitate intracellular penetration in liver tissue, the presence of kinase/esterase enzymes in the lung can, in part, explain the successful uptake and intracellular activation of sofosbuvir in alveolar epithelial cells, as a viral reservoir. We may also assume that cellular uptake of the pro-drug (sofosbuvir) as well as intracellular concentrations of biologically active triphosphate metabolites within lung epithelial cells are low, compared with those in hepatocytes. Also, the estimated level of the triphosphate metabolites are greater than the inhibition constant for the HCV NS5B polymerase. Although sofosbuvir/velpatasvir may effectively inhibit the SARS-CoV-2 RdRp, our results suggest that higher treatment doses against SARS-CoV-2 in respiratory epithelial cells may be needed than those recommended for HCV. In addition, the sample size we used was relatively small and sofosbuvir/velpatasvir administration along with the standard of care at early stages of disease may be more effective. These limitations may have influenced the effectiveness of sofosbuvir/velpatasvir versus the standard of care; therefore, the results should be interpreted with caution.\nBy the time of this study, three randomized clinical trials had compared the efficacy of oral sofosbuvir/daclatasvir and the standard of care in COVID-19 treatment and reported inconsistent results. However, Simmons et al. conducted a meta-analysis of these three studies with 176 patients and concluded that sofosbuvir/daclatasvir improved survival and clinical recovery in patients with moderate to severe COVID-19.\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, with the increase in the number of hospitalized patients, hospitals may increase staff and equipment or cancel non-essential elective surgery in order to increase the number of beds available for additional patients; however, spare capacity for COVID-19 patients is limited at the time of peak demand. According to our findings, treatment with sofosbuvir/velpatasvir might have reduced the length of hospital stay and shortened the time to clinical improvement. So, perhaps it can increase the availability of hospital beds during the COVID-19 pandemic.\nIn the present study, the male gender was dominant (55%), which was similar to the results of other studies in this regard. Interestingly, all deaths occurred in male patients and the mean age of the deceased was 61.3 +- 6.3 years. Several studies have found that male patients with COVID-19 are at higher risk of more severe clinical outcomes and mortality, as observed in SARS and MERS infections. This difference may be related to the immune system and sociocultural factors. The determinants of these gender-dependent differences should be confirmed in future studies. However, it was not possible to perform subgroup analysis for sex and age because of the small sample size.\nIn a pooled analysis of the ASTRAL trials, in order to evaluate the safety and efficacy of sofosbuvir/velpatasvir for chronic HCV infection, headache, fatigue, nausea and nasopharyngitis were the most common adverse events in individuals receiving sofosbuvir/velpatasvir. The results showed that in the modified ITT population the incidence of diarrhoea was significantly higher in the sofosbuvir/velpatasvir arm compared with the control arm (P &lt; 0.001). Considering that diarrhoea is not a typical adverse reaction of sofosbuvir/velpatasvir, it was most likely due to the synergistic antiviral affect of sofosbuvir/velpatasvir plus lopinavir/ritonavir and hydroxychloroquine. However, the rates of other adverse events were similar in the patients receiving sofosbuvir/velpatasvir and the national standard of care. No patient interrupted treatment or discontinued treatment early because of these events.\nThe results of the second RT-PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 were not available in 41 patients (51.25%). Nevertheless, of 39 patients who had a second PCR test, 16 patients (6 in the sofosbuvir/velpatasvir arm and 11 in the control arm) had RT-PCR conversion at discharge from the hospital. Zhou et al. found the median duration of viral shedding was 20 days in patients with severe COVID-19 and could be as long as 37 days. The highest temperature at admission and time from symptom onset to admission are factors associated with a prolonged duration of viral shedding. Therefore, the low rate of RT-PCR conversion might be due to the earlier discharge of patients from the hospital. Furthermore, quantitative viral load data were not available; therefore, it cannot be assessed whether adding sofosbuvir/velpatasvir treatment could reduce the duration and quantity of virus shedding compared with the control arm.\nIn the hepatoma cell line HuH-7 and type II pneumocytes (Calu-3), sofosbuvir inhibited SARS-CoV-2 with an EC50 of 6.2 and 9.5 muM, respectively. In addition, the bioavailability of sofosbuvir is high and maximum plasma concentrations (Cmax) occurred about 0.5-2 h after administration. In this trial, only one dosing regimen of sofosbuvir was studied; this regimen was selected based on previous studies and the doses commonly used for hepatitis treatment in Iran. However, the concentration of sofosbuvir was not monitored and it is not clear whether these concentrations are effective against SARS-CoV-2 in the body.\nIt is worth noting that the patients were heterogeneous in terms of disease duration and the median time from the onset of symptoms to the start of the study treatment; therefore, a combination of sofosbuvir/velpatasvir may be more effective if it is started as soon as possible after the onset of symptoms of a probable COVID-19 infection. It should be mentioned that the efficacy of oseltamivir, an antiviral agent used for treatment of influenza, is greatest when administered within 48 h of the onset of symptoms. Similar arguments are proposed for early treatment of COVID-19. In this regard, we also registered a clinical trial (https://www.irct.ir/) to evaluate the safety and efficacy of sofosbuvir/daclatasvir versus the standard of care alone in non-hospitalized adults with early COVID-19.\nTo the best of our knowledge, this study is the first published clinical trial of the effect of a sofosbuvir/velpatasvir combination on treatment of patients with COVID-19. It was performed in a public hospital and these hospitals manage most of the patients in Iran. However, the study also had several limitations, such as not assessing the viral load, the small sample size and an open-label design. Furthermore, in order to facilitate and speed up the study in the critical conditions of pandemic occurrence, we did not want to use a placebo in this clinical trial. Larger randomized clinical trials in more homogeneous study populations, considering more parameters, are needed for accurate estimation of the efficacy of sofosbuvir/velpatasvir.\nTo summarize the above-mentioned data, adding sofosbuvir/velpatasvir to the standard of care did not improve the clinical status or reduce mortality in patients with moderate to severe COVID-19. The data of this well-designed trial is of great importance because, as previously mentioned, in a recently published report Simmons et al. concluded that sofosbuvir/daclatasvir improves survival and clinical recovery in patients with moderate to severe SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, it is noteworthy that, contrary to our well-designed clinical trial, in the mentioned study: (a) the sample size for analysis was relatively small; (b) one of the trials was not randomized; and (c) the designs were not standardized, and the results need to be confirmed in larger randomized controlled trials. We recommend that a change in the route of drug administration (for instance as a rectal formulation), increasing the duration of the intervention or increasing drug dosage (e.g. 800 mg sofosbuvir daily) be considered in future clinical trials.\nReferences\nTreatment options for COVID-19: the reality and challenges\nThe current understanding and potential therapeutic options to combat COVID-19\nRole of drug repurposing in current treatment strategies against COVID-19; systemic review\nMiddle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus: another zoonotic betacoronavirus causing SARS-like disease\nQuantitative structure-activity relationship and molecular docking revealed a potency of anti-hepatitis C virus drugs against human corona viruses\nAnti-HCV, nucleotide inhibitors, repurposing against COVID-19\nAnti-HIV and Anti-HCV drugs are the putative inhibitors of RNA-dependent-RNA polymerase activity of NSP12 of the SARS CoV-2 (COVID-19)\nStructural elucidation of SARS-CoV-2 vital proteins: computational methods reveal potential drug candidates against main protease, Nsp12 polymerase and Nsp13 helicase\nHighlights on evidence-based treatment strategies for COVID-19: a review\nStructure of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase from COVID-19 virus\nEditorial - sofosbuvir/velpatasvir as a combination with strong potential activity against SARS-CoV2 (COVID-19) infection: how to use direct-acting antivirals as broad-spectrum antiviral agents\nSofosbuvir as repurposed antiviral drug against COVID-19: why were we convinced to evaluate the drug in a registered/approved clinical trial?\nIn silico studies on therapeutic agents for COVID-19: drug repurposing approach\nSofosbuvir as a potential alternative to treat the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic\nSofosbuvir and ribavirin liver pharmacokinetics in patients infected with hepatitis C virus\nEvaluation of the efficacy of sofosbuvir plus daclatasvir in combination with ribavirin for hospitalized COVID-19 patients with moderate disease compared with standard care: a single-centre randomized controlled trial\nThe impact of sofosbuvir/daclatasvir or ribavirin in patients with severe COVID-19\nSofosbuvir and daclatasvir compared with standard of care in the treatment of patients admitted to hospital with moderate or severe coronavirus infection (COVID-19): a randomized controlled trial\nSofosbuvir/daclatasvir regimens for the treatment of COVID-19: an individual patient data meta-analysis\nGender differences in patients with COVID-19: focus on severity and mortality\nCOVID-19: the gendered impacts of the outbreak\nSex and gender differences in the outcome of patients with COVID-19\nSofosbuvir with velpatasvir\nClinical course and risk factors for mortality of adult inpatients with COVID-19 in Wuhan, China: a retrospective cohort study\nFactors associated with duration of viral shedding in adults with COVID-19 outside of Wuhan, China: a retrospective cohort study\nThe in vitro antiviral activity of the anti-hepatitis C virus (HCV) drugs daclatasvir and sofosbuvir against SARS-CoV-2\nPharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic, and drug-interaction profile of the hepatitis C virus NS5B polymerase inhibitor sofosbuvir\nRisk factors for severe illness with 2009 pandemic influenza A (H1N1) virus infection in China\n","References depth 1":[{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Treatment options for COVID-19: the reality and challenges","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[],"References depth 2":[{"doi":"10.1016/S0140-6736(20)30566-3","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Clinical course and risk factors for mortality of adult inpatients with COVID-19 in Wuhan, China: a retrospective cohort study","abstract":"Background\nSince December, 2019, Wuhan, China, has experienced an outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).\n\n Epidemiological and clinical characteristics of patients with COVID-19 have been reported but risk factors for mortality and a detailed clinical course of illness, including viral shedding, have not been well described.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this retrospective, multicentre cohort study, we included all adult inpatients (?18 years old) with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 from Jinyintan Hospital and Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital (Wuhan, China) who had been discharged or had died by Jan 31, 2020.

We obtained samples of blood, urine, posterior oropharyngeal saliva, and rectal swabs.\n\n Serial viral load was ascertained by reverse transcriptase quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR).\n\n Antibody levels against the SARS-CoV-2 internal nucleoprotein (NP) and surface spike protein receptor binding domain (RBD) were measured using EIA.\n\n Whole-genome sequencing was done to identify possible mutations

Mediated by the Viral Polymerase and the Proofreading Exoribonuclease","abstract":"Emerging coronaviruses (CoVs) cause severe disease in humans, but no approved therapeutics are available.\n The CoV nsp14 exoribonuclease (ExoN) has complicated development of antiviral nucleosides due to its proofreading activity.\n We recently reported that the nucleoside analogue GS-5734 (remdesivir) potently inhibits human and zoonotic CoVs in vitro and in a severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) mouse model.\n However, studies with GS-5734 have not reported resistance associated with GS-5734, nor do we understand the action of GS-5734 in wild-type (WT) proofreading CoVs.\n Here, we show that GS-5734 inhibits murine hepatitis virus (MHV) with similar 50% effective concentration values (EC50) as SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV).\n Passage of WT MHV in the presence of the GS-5734 parent nucleoside selected two mutations in the nsp12 polymerase at residues conserved across all CoVs that conferred up to 5.6-fold resistance to GS-5734, as determined by EC50.\n The resistant viruses were unable to compete with WT in direct coinfection passage in the absence of GS-5734. Introduction of the MHV resistance mutations into SARS-CoV resulted in the same in vitro resistance phenotype and attenuated SARS-CoV pathogenesis in a mouse model.\n Finally, we demonstrate that an MHV mutant lacking ExoN proofreading was significantly more sensitive to GS-5734. Combined, the results indicate that GS-5734 interferes with the nsp12 polymerase even in the setting of intact ExoN proofreading activity and that resistance can be overcome with increased, nontoxic concentrations of GS-5734, further supporting the development of GS-5734 as a broad-spectrum therapeutic to protect against contemporary and emerging CoVs.\n","id":"PMC5844999","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"American Society for Microbiology","authors":[{"firstname":"Maria

were breathing ambient air or a ratio of the partial pressure of oxygen (Pao2) to the fraction of inspired oxygen (Fio2) of less than 300 mm Hg.\n\n Patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either lopinavir–ritonavir (400 mg and 100 mg, respectively) twice a day for 14 days, in addition to standard care, or standard care alone.\n\n The primary end point was the time to clinical improvement, defined as the time from randomization to either an improvement of two points on a seven-category ordinal scale or discharge from the hospital, whichever came first.\n\n\nResults\nA total of 199 patients with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection underwent randomization; 99 were assigned to the lopinavir–ritonavir group, and 100 to the standard-care group.\n\n Treatment with lopinavir–ritonavir was not associated with a difference from standard care in the time to clinical improvement (hazard ratio for clinical improvement, 1.24; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.90 to 1.72).\n\n Mortality at 28 days was similar in the lopinavir–ritonavir group and the standard-care group (19.2% vs.\n\n 25.0%; difference, ?5.8 percentage points; 95% CI, ?17.3 to 5.7).\n\n The percentages of patients with detectable viral RNA at various time points were similar.\n\n In a modified intention-to-treat analysis, lopinavir–ritonavir led to a median time to clinical improvement that was shorter by 1 day than that observed with standard care (hazard ratio, 1.39; 95% CI, 1.00 to 1.91).\n\n Gastrointestinal adverse events were more common in the lopinavir–ritonavir group, but serious adverse events were more common in the standard-care group.\n\n Lopinavir–ritonavir treatment was stopped early in 13 patients (13.8%) because of adverse events.\n\n\nConclusions\nIn hospitalized adult patients with severe Covid-19, no benefit was observed with lopinavir–ritonavir treatment beyond standard care.\n\n Future trials in patients with severe illness may help to confirm or exclude the possibility of a treatment benefit.\n\n (Funded by Major Projects of National Science and Technology on New Drug Creation and Development and others; Chinese Clinical Trial Register

with the drug either before or after exposure to the virus, suggesting both prophylactic and therapeutic advantage.\n\n In addition to the well-known functions of chloroquine such as elevations of endosomal pH, the drug appears to interfere with terminal glycosylation of the cellular receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2. This may negatively influence the virus-receptor binding and abrogate the infection, with further ramifications by the elevation of vesicular pH, resulting in the inhibition of infection and spread of SARS CoV at clinically admissible concentrations.\n\n\nConclusion\nChloroquine is effective in preventing the spread of SARS CoV in cell culture.\n\n Favorable inhibition of virus spread was observed when the cells were either treated with chloroquine prior to or after SARS CoV infection.\n\n In addition, the indirect immunofluorescence assay described herein represents a simple and rapid method for screening SARS-CoV antiviral compounds.\n\n\n","id":"PMC1232869","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"BioMed Central","authors":[{"firstname":"Martin J","surname":"Vincent","email":"mvincent@cdc.gov","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Eric","surname":"Bergeron","email":"bergere@ircm.qc.ca","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Suzanne","surname":"Benjannet","email":"benjans@ircm.qc.ca","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Bobbie R","surname":"Erickson","email":"BErickson1@cdc.gov","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Pierre E","surname":"Rollin","email":"PRollin@cdc.gov","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Thomas G","surname":"Ksiazek","email":"TKsiazek@cdc.gov","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Nabil G","surname":"Seidah","email":"seidahn@ircm.qc.ca","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Stuart T","surname":"Nichol","email":"SNichol@cdc.gov","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Remdesivir and chloroquine effectively inhibit the recently emerged novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) in vitro","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1016/j.jcrc.2020.03.005","date":"1970-01-01","title":"A systematic review on the efficacy and safety of chloroquine for the treatment of COVID-19","abstract":"Purpose\nCOVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) is a public health emergency of international concern.\n\n As of this time, there is no known effective pharmaceutical treatment, although it is much needed for patient contracting the severe form of the disease.\n\n The aim of this systematic review was to summarize the evidence regarding chloroquine for the treatment of COVID-19.\nMethods\nPubMed, EMBASE, and three trial Registries were searched for studies on the use of chloroquine in patients with COVID-19.\nResults\nWe included six articles (one narrative letter, one in-vitro study, one editorial, expert consensus paper, two national guideline documents) and 23 ongoing clinical trials in China.\n\n Chloroquine seems to be effective in limiting the replication of SARS-CoV-2 (virus causing COVID-19) in vitro.\n\n\nConclusions\nThere is rationale, pre-clinical evidence of effectiveness and evidence of safety from long-time clinical use for other indications to justify clinical research on chloroquine in patients with COVID-19.

Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) first broke out in Wuhan (China) and subsequently spread worldwide.\n\n Chloroquine has been sporadically used in treating SARS-CoV-2

We propose that the immunomodulatory effect of hydroxychloroquine also may be useful in controlling the cytokine storm that occurs late-phase in critically ill SARS-CoV-2 infected patients.\n\n Currently, there is no evidence to support the use of hydroxychloroquine in SARS-CoV-2 infection.\n\n\nMethods\nThe pharmacological activity of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine was tested using SARS-CoV-2 infected Vero cells.\n\n Physiologically-based pharmacokinetic models (PBPK) were implemented for both drugs separately by integrating their in vitro data.\n\n Using the PBPK models, hydroxychloroquine concentrations in lung fluid were simulated under 5 different dosing regimens to explore the most effective regimen whilst considering the drug’s safety profile.\n\n\nResults\nHydroxychloroquine (EC50=0.72 ?M) was found to be more potent than chloroquine (EC50=5.47 ?M) in vitro.\n\n Based on PBPK models results, a loading dose of 400 mg twice daily of

A Review of Historical Classics, Research Evidence and Current Prevention Programs","abstract":"Objective\nSince December 2019, an outbreak of corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) occurred in Wuhan, and rapidly spread to almost all parts of China.\n\n This was followed by prevention programs recommending Chinese medicine (CM) for the prevention.\n\n In order to provide evidence for CM recommendations, we reviewed ancient classics and human studies.\n\n\nMethods\nHistorical records on prevention and treatment of infections in CM classics, clinical evidence of CM on the prevention of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and H1N1 influenza, and CM prevention programs issued by health authorities in China since the COVID-19 outbreak were retrieved from different databases and websites till 12 February, 2020. Research evidence included data from clinical trials, cohort or other population studies using CM for preventing contagious respiratory virus diseases.\n\n\nResults\nThe use of CM to prevent epidemics of infectious diseases was traced back to ancient Chinese practice cited in Huangdi’s Internal Classic (Huang Di Nei Jing) where preventive effects were recorded.\n\n There were 3 studies using CM for prevention of SARS and 4 studies for H1N1 influenza.\n\n None of the participants who took CM contracted SARS in the 3 studies.\n\n The infection rate of H1N1 influenza in the CM group was significantly lower than the non-CM group (relative risk 0.36, 95% confidence interval 0.24–0.52; n=4).\n\n For prevention of COVID-19, 23 provinces in China issued CM programs.\n\n The main principles of CM use were to tonify qi to protect from external pathogens, disperse wind and discharge heat, and resolve dampness.\n\n The most frequently used herbs included Radix astragali (Huangqi), Radix glycyrrhizae (Gancao), Radix saposhnikoviae (Fangfeng), Rhizoma Atractylodis Macrocephalae (Baizhu), Lonicerae Japonicae Flos (Jinyinhua), and Fructus forsythia (Lianqiao).\n\n\nConclusions\nBased on historical records and human evidence of SARS and H1N1 influenza prevention, Chinese herbal formula could be an alternative approach for prevention of COVID-19 in high-risk population.\n\n Prospective, rigorous population studies are warranted to confirm the potential preventive effect of CM.\n\n\nElectronic Supplementary Material\nSupplementary material is

The primary composite end point was admission to an intensive care unit (ICU), the use of mechanical ventilation, or death.\n\n\nResults\nThe median age of the patients was 47 years; 41.9% of the patients were female.\n\n The primary composite end point occurred in 67 patients (6.1%), including 5.0% who were admitted to the ICU, 2.3% who underwent invasive mechanical ventilation, and 1.4% who died.\n\n Only 1.9% of the patients had a history of direct contact with wildlife.\n\n Among nonresidents of Wuhan, 72.3% had contact with residents of Wuhan, including 31.3% who had visited the city.\n\n The most common symptoms were fever (43.8% on admission and 88.7% during hospitalization) and cough (67.8%).\n\n Diarrhea was uncommon (3.8%).\n\n The median incubation period was 4 days (interquartile range, 2 to 7).\n\n On admission, ground-glass opacity was the most common radiologic finding on chest computed tomography (CT) (56.4%).\n\n No radiographic or CT abnormality was found

validated.\n\n\nMethods\nCoagulation results, medications, and outcomes of consecutive patients being classified as having severe COVID?19 in Tongji hospital were retrospectively analyzed.\n\n The 28?day mortality between heparin users and nonusers were compared, as was a different risk of coagulopathy, which was stratified by the sepsis?induced coagulopathy (SIC) score or D?dimer result.\n\n\nResults\nThere were 449 patients with severe COVID?19 enrolled into the study, 99 of them received heparin (mainly with low molecular weight heparin) for 7 days or longer.\n\n D?dimer, prothrombin time, and age were positively, and platelet count was negatively, correlated with 28?day mortality in multivariate analysis.\n\n No difference in 28?day mortality was found between heparin

A.\n\n\nConclusions\nCoronavirus-HKU1 accounted for 1.6% of adult respiratory infections and should be considered in differential diagnosis of severe respiratory illnesses among adults.\n\n\n","id":"PMC5466428","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Oxford University

epithelial cells of the respiratory tract, resulting in diffuse alveolar damage.\n Several organs/cell types may be infected in the course of the illness, including mucosal cells of the intestines, tubular epithelial cells of the kidneys, neurons of the brain, and several types of immune cells, and certain organs may suffer from indirect injury.\n Extensive studies have provided a basic understanding of the pathogenesis of this disease.\n In this review we describe the most significant pathological features of SARS, explore the etiological factors causing these pathological changes, and discuss the major pathogenetic mechanisms.\n The latter include dysregulation of cytokines/chemokines, deficiencies in the innate immune response, direct infection of immune cells, direct viral cytopathic effects, down-regulation of lung protective angiotensin converting enzyme 2, autoimmunity, and genetic factors.\n It seems that both abnormal immune responses and injury to immune cells may

coronavirus: implications for virus origins and receptor binding","abstract":"Background\nIn late December, 2019, patients presenting with viral pneumonia due to an unidentified microbial agent were reported in Wuhan, China.\n\n A novel coronavirus was subsequently identified as the causative pathogen, provisionally named 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).\n\n As of Jan 26, 2020, more than 2000 cases of 2019-nCoV infection have been confirmed, most of which involved people living in or visiting Wuhan, and human-to-human transmission has been confirmed.\n\n\nMethods\nWe did next-generation sequencing of samples from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and cultured isolates from nine inpatients, eight of whom had visited the Huanan seafood market in Wuhan.\n\n Complete and partial 2019-nCoV genome sequences were obtained from these individuals.\n\n Viral contigs were connected using Sanger sequencing to obtain the full-length genomes, with the terminal regions determined by rapid amplification of cDNA ends.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these 2019-nCoV genomes and those of other coronaviruses was used to determine the evolutionary history of the virus and help infer its likely origin.\n\n Homology modelling was done to explore the likely receptor-binding properties of the virus.\n\n\nFindings\nThe ten genome sequences of 2019-nCoV obtained from the nine patients were extremely similar, exhibiting more than 99·98% sequence identity.\n\n Notably, 2019-nCoV was closely related (with 88% identity) to two bat-derived severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-like coronaviruses, bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21, collected in 2018 in Zhoushan, eastern China, but were more distant from SARS-CoV (about 79%) and MERS-CoV (about 50%).\n\n Phylogenetic analysis revealed that 2019-nCoV fell within the subgenus Sarbecovirus of the genus Betacoronavirus, with a relatively long branch length to its closest relatives bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21, and was genetically distinct from SARS-CoV.\n\n Notably, homology modelling revealed that 2019-nCoV had a similar receptor-binding domain structure to that of SARS-CoV, despite amino acid variation at some key residues.\n\n\nInterpretation\n2019-nCoV is sufficiently divergent from SARS-CoV to be considered a new human-infecting betacoronavirus.\n\n Although our phylogenetic analysis suggests that bats might be the original host of this virus, an animal sold at the seafood market in Wuhan might represent an intermediate host facilitating the emergence of the virus in humans.\n\n Importantly, structural analysis suggests that 2019-nCoV might be able to bind to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor in humans.\n\n The future evolution, adaptation, and spread of this virus warrant urgent investigation.\n\n\nFunding\nNational Key Research and Development Program of China, National Major Project for Control and Prevention of Infectious Disease in China, Chinese Academy of

The S1 protein of Pangolin-CoV is much more closely related to SARS-CoV-2 than to RaTG13. Five key amino acid residues involved in the interaction with human ACE2 are completely consistent between Pangolin-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, but four amino acid mutations are present in RaTG13. Both Pangolin-CoV and RaTG13 lost the putative furin recognition sequence motif at S1/S2 cleavage site that can be observed in the SARS-CoV-2.

novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).\n\n We report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatment and clinical outcomes of these patients.\n\n\nMethods\nAll patients with suspected 2019-nCoV were admitted to a designated hospital in Wuhan.\n\n We prospectively collected and analysed data on patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection by real-time RT-PCR and next-generation sequencing.\n\n Data were obtained with standardised data collection forms shared by WHO and the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium from electronic medical records.\n\n Researchers also directly communicated with patients or their families to ascertain epidemiological and symptom data.\n\n Outcomes were also compared between patients who had been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and those who had not.\n\n\nFindings\nBy Jan 2, 2020, 41 admitted hospital patients had been identified as having laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection.\n\n Most of the infected patients were men (30 [73%] of 41); less than half had underlying diseases (13 [32%]), including diabetes (eight [20%]), hypertension (six [15%]), and cardiovascular disease (six [15%]).\n\n Median age was 49·0 years (IQR 41·0–58·0).\n\n 27 (66%) of 41 patients had been exposed to Huanan seafood market.\n\n One family cluster was found.\n\n Common symptoms at onset of illness were fever (40 [98%] of 41 patients), cough (31 [76%]), and myalgia or fatigue (18 [44%]); less common symptoms were sputum production (11 [28%] of 39), headache (three [8%] of 38), haemoptysis (two [5%] of 39), and diarrhoea (one [3%] of 38).\n\n Dyspnoea developed in 22 (55%) of 40 patients (median time from illness onset to dyspnoea 8·0 days [IQR

available.\n\n\nResults\nWe report, however, that chloroquine has strong antiviral effects on SARS-CoV infection of primate cells.\n\n These inhibitory effects are observed when the cells are treated with the drug either before or after exposure to the virus, suggesting both prophylactic and therapeutic advantage.\n\n In addition to the well-known functions of chloroquine such as elevations of endosomal pH, the drug appears to interfere with terminal glycosylation of the cellular receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2. This may negatively influence the virus-receptor binding and abrogate the infection, with further ramifications by the elevation of vesicular pH, resulting in the inhibition of infection and spread of SARS CoV at clinically admissible concentrations.\n\n\nConclusion\nChloroquine is effective in preventing the spread of SARS CoV in cell culture.\n\n Favorable inhibition of virus spread was observed when the cells were either treated with chloroquine prior to or after SARS CoV infection.\n\n In addition, the indirect immunofluorescence assay described herein represents a simple and rapid method for screening SARS-CoV antiviral compounds.\n\n\n","id":"PMC1232869","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"BioMed Central","authors":[{"firstname":"Martin

serious\nEbola epidemics in history and greatly threatened public health worldwide.\n The\ndevelopment of additional effective anti-Ebola therapeutic agents is therefore\nquite urgent.\n In this study, via high throughput screening of Food and Drug\nAdministration-approved drugs, we identified that teicoplanin, a glycopeptide\nantibiotic, potently prevents the entry of Ebola envelope pseudotyped viruses\ninto the cytoplasm.\n Furthermore, teicoplanin also has an inhibitory effect on\ntranscription- and replication-competent virus-like particles, with an\nIC50 as low as 330 nm.\n Comparative analysis further\ndemonstrated that teicoplanin is able to block the entry of Middle East\nrespiratory syndrome (MERS) and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)\nenvelope pseudotyped viruses as well.\n Teicoplanin derivatives such as\ndalbavancin, oritavancin, and telavancin can also inhibit the entry of Ebola,\nMERS, and SARS viruses.\n Mechanistic studies showed that teicoplanin blocks Ebola\nvirus entry by specifically inhibiting the activity of cathepsin L, opening a\nnovel avenue for the development of additional glycopeptides as potential\ninhibitors of cathepsin

evaluated the antiviral effects of tetracycline (TETRA) derivatives and other common antiviral agents against CHIKV.\n Our results showed that within the TETRA derivatives group, Doxycycline (DOXY) exhibited the highest inhibitory effect against CHIKV replication in Vero cells.\n On the other hand, in the antiviral group Ribavirin (RIBA) showed higher inhibitory effects against CHIKV replication compared to Aciclovir (ACIC).\n Interestingly, RIBA inhibitory effects were also higher than all but DOXY within the TETRA derivatives group.\n Docking studies of DOXY to viral cysteine protease and E2 envelope protein showed non-competitive interaction with docking energy of -6.6±0.1 and -6.4±0.1 kcal/mol respectively.\n The 50% effective concentration (EC50) of DOXY and RIBA was determined to be 10.95±2.12 ?M and 15.51±1.62 ?M respectively, while DOXY+RIBA (1:1 combination) showed an EC50 of 4.52±1.42 ?M.\n When compared, DOXY showed higher inhibition of viral infectivity and entry than RIBA.\n In contrast however, RIBA showed higher inhibition against viral replication in target cells compared to DOXY.\n Assays using mice as animal models revealed that DOXY+RIBA effectively

coronavirus-specific human monoclonal antibody","abstract":"The newly identified 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) has caused more than 11,900 laboratory-confirmed human infections, including 259 deaths, posing a serious threat to human health.\n Currently, however, there is no specific antiviral treatment or vaccine.\n Considering the relatively high identity of receptor-binding domain (RBD) in 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV, it is urgent to assess the cross-reactivity of anti-SARS CoV antibodies with 2019-nCoV spike protein, which could have important implications for rapid development of vaccines and therapeutic antibodies against 2019-nCoV.\n Here, we report for the first time that a SARS-CoV-specific human monoclonal antibody, CR3022, could bind potently with 2019-nCoV RBD (KD of 6.3 nM).\n The epitope of CR3022 does not overlap with the ACE2 binding site within 2019-nCoV RBD.\n These results suggest that CR3022 may have the potential to be developed as candidate therapeutics, alone or in combination with other neutralizing antibodies, for the prevention and treatment of 2019-nCoV infections.\n Interestingly, some of the most potent SARS-CoV-specific neutralizing antibodies (e.\ng.\n m396, CR3014) that target the ACE2 binding site of SARS-CoV failed to bind 2019-nCoV spike protein, implying that the difference in the RBD of SARS-CoV and 2019-nCoV has a critical impact for the cross-reactivity of neutralizing antibodies, and that it is still necessary to develop novel monoclonal antibodies that could bind specifically to 2019-nCoV RBD.\n","id":"PMC7048180","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Taylor &amp;

inhibition of Herpes simplex virus DNA polymerase: mechanistic insights into the anti-herpetic mode of action of herbal drug withaferin A","abstract":"Background\nHerpes Simplex Virus 1 and 2 causes several infections in humans including cold sores and encephalitis.\n\n Previous antiviral studies on herpes viruses have focussed on developing nucleoside analogues that can inhibit viral polymerase and terminate the replicating viral DNA.\n\n However, these drugs bear an intrinsic non-specificity as they can also inhibit cellular polymerase apart from the viral one.\n\n The present study is an attempt to elucidate the action mechanism of naturally occurring withaferin A in inhibiting viral DNA polymerase, thus providing an evidence for its development as a novel anti-herpetic drug.\n\n\nResults\nWithaferin A was found to bind very similarly to that of the previously reported 4-oxo-DHQ inhibitor.\n\n Withaferin A was observed binding to the residues Gln 617, Gln 618, Asn 815 and Tyr 818, all of which are crucial to the proper functioning of the polymerase.\n\n A comparison of the conformation obtained from docking and the molecular dynamics simulations shows that substantial changes in the binding conformations have occurred.\n\n These results indicate that the initial receptor-ligand interaction observed after docking can be limited due to the receptor rigid docking algorithm and that the conformations and interactions observed after simulation runs are more energetically favoured.\n\n\nConclusions\nWe have performed docking and molecular dynamics simulation studies to elucidate the binding mechanism of prospective herbal drug withaferin A onto the structure of DNA polymerase of Herpes simplex virus.\n\n Our docking simulations results give high binding affinity of the ligand to the receptor.\n\n Long de novo MD simulations for 10 ns performed allowed us to evaluate the dynamic behaviour of the system studied and corroborate the docking results, as well as identify key residues in the enzyme-inhibitor interactions.\n\n The present MD simulations support the hypothesis that withaferin A is a potential ligand to target/inhibit DNA polymerase of the Herpes simplex virus.\n\n Results of these studies will also guide the design of selective inhibitors of DNA POL with high specificity and potent activity in order to strengthen the therapeutic arsenal available today against the dangerous biological warfare agent represented by Herpes Simplex Virus.\n\n\n","id":"PMC3278839","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"BioMed

a plant-derived polyphenolic compounds with many potential health benefits.\n\n In the present study, antiviral activity of four types of bioflavonoid against dengue virus type -2 (DENV-2) in Vero cell was evaluated.\n\n Anti-dengue activity of these compounds was determined at different stages of DENV-2 infection and replication cycle.\n\n DENV replication was measured by Foci Forming Unit Reduction Assay (FFURA) and quantitative RT-PCR.\n\n Selectivity Index value (SI) was determined as the ratio of cytotoxic concentration 50 (CC50) to inhibitory concentration 50 (IC50) for each compound.\n\n\nResults\nThe half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of quercetin against dengue virus was 35.7 ?g mL-1 when it was used after virus adsorption to the cells.\n\n The IC50 decreased to 28.9 ?g mL-1 when the cells were treated continuously for 5 h before virus infection and up to 4 days post-infection.\n\n The SI values for quercetin were 7.07 and 8.74 ?g mL-1, respectively, the highest compared to all bioflavonoids studied.\n\n Naringin only exhibited anti-adsorption effects against DENV-2 with IC50 = 168.2 ?g mL-1 and its related SI was 1.3. Daidzein showed a weak anti-dengue activity with IC50 = 142.6 ?g mL-1 when the DENV-2 infected cells were treated after virus adsorption.\n\n The SI value for this compound was 1.03. Hesperetin did not exhibit any antiviral activity against DENV-2. The findings obtained from Foci Forming Unit Reduction Assay (FFURA) were corroborated by findings of the qRT-PCR assays.\n\n Quercetin and daidzein (50 ?g mL-1) reduced DENV-2 RNA levels by 67% and 25%, respectively.\n\n There was no significant inhibition of DENV-2 RNA levels with naringin and hesperetin.\n\n\nConclusion\nResults from the study suggest that only quercetin demonstrated significant anti-DENV-2 inhibitory activities.\n\n Other bioflavonoids, including daidzein, naringin and hesperetin showed minimal to no significant inhibition of DENV-2 virus replication.\n\n These findings, together with those previously reported suggest that select group of bioflavonoids including quercetin and fisetin, exhibited significant inhibitory activities against dengue virus.\n\n This group of flavonoids, flavonol, could be investigated further to discover the common mechanisms of inhibition of dengue virus replication.\n\n\n","id":"PMC3271998","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"BioMed Central","authors":[{"firstname":"Keivan","surname":"Zandi","email":"keivan@um.edu.my","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Boon-Teong","surname":"Teoh","email":"boonlim82@yahoo.com","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Sing-Sin","surname":"Sam","email":"singsin83@yahoo.com","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Pooi-Fong","surname":"Wong","email":"wongpf@um.edu.my","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Mohd Rais","surname":"Mustafa","email":"rais@um.edu.my","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Sazaly","surname":"AbuBakar","email":"sazaly@um.edu.my","contributions":"2"}]},{"doi":"10.1128/JVI.78.20.11334-11339.2004","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Small molecules blocking the entry of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus into host cells","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1111/j.1440-1681.2006.04415.x","date":"2005-12-26","title":"ANTIVIRAL EFFECTS OF SAIKOSAPONINS ON HUMAN CORONAVIRUS 229E <italic>IN VITRO</italic>\n","abstract":"\n1Saikosaponins represent a group of oleanane derivatives, usually as glucosides, that are found in a number of plant families.\n Saikosaponins isolated from medicinal plants such as Bupleurum spp.\n, Heteromorpha spp.\n and Scrophularia scorodonia have been reported to possess various biological activities, specifically antihepatitis, antinephritis, antihepatoma, anti?inflammation, immunomodulation and antibacterial effects.\n","id":"PMC7162031","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Blackwell Publishing Asia","authors":[{"firstname":"Pei?Win","surname":"Cheng","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Lean?Teik","surname":"Ng","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Lien?Chai","surname":"Chiang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Chun?Ching","surname":"Lin","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"10.3390/nu9080866","date":"2017-08-09","title":"The Roles of Vitamin C in Skin Health","abstract":"The primary function of the skin is to act as a barrier against insults from the environment, and its unique structure reflects this.\n The skin is composed of two layers: the epidermal outer layer is highly cellular and provides the barrier function, and the inner dermal layer ensures strength and elasticity and gives nutritional support to the epidermis.\n Normal skin contains high concentrations of vitamin C, which supports important and well-known functions, stimulating collagen synthesis and assisting in antioxidant protection against UV-induced photodamage.\n This knowledge is often used as a rationale for the addition of vitamin C to topical applications, but the efficacy of such treatment, as opposed to optimising dietary vitamin C intake, is poorly understood.\n This review discusses the potential roles for vitamin C in skin health and summarises the in vitro and in vivo research to date.\n We compare the efficacy of nutritional intake of vitamin C versus topical application, identify the areas where lack of evidence limits our understanding of the potential benefits of vitamin C on skin health, and suggest which skin properties are most likely to benefit from improved nutritional vitamin C intake.\n","id":"PMC5579659","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"MDPI","authors":[{"firstname":"Juliet M.","surname":"Pullar","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Anitra C.","surname":"Carr","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Margreet C.

infection is associated with high mortality and has no approved antiviral therapy.\n\n We aimed to compare ribavirin and interferon alfa-2a treatment for patients with severe MERS-CoV infection with a supportive therapy only.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this retrospective cohort study, we included adults (aged ?16 years) with laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV infection and pneumonia needing ventilation support, diagnosed between Oct 23, 2012, and May 1, 2014, at the Prince Sultan Military Medical City (Riyadh, Saudi Arabia).\n\n All patients received appropriate supportive care and regular clinical and laboratory monitoring, but patients diagnosed after Sept 16, 2013, were also given oral ribavirin (dose based on calculated creatinine clearance, for 8–10 days) and subcutaneous pegylated interferon alfa-2a (180 ?g per week for 2 weeks).\n\n The primary endpoint was 14-day and 28-day survival from the date of MERS-CoV infection diagnosis.\n\n We used ?2 and Fischer's exact test to analyse categorical variables and the t test to analyse continuous variables.\n\n\nFindings\nWe analysed 20 patients who received ribavirin and interferon (treatment group; initiated a median of 3 days [range 0–8] after diagnosis) and 24 who did not (comparator group).\n\n Baseline clinical and laboratory characteristics were similar between groups, apart from baseline absolute neutrophil count, which was significantly lower in the comparator group (5·88?×?109/L [SD 3·95] vs 9·88?×?109/L [6·63]; p=0·023).\n\n 14 (70%) of 20 patients in the treatment group had survived after 14 days, compared with seven (29%) of 24 in the comparator group (p=0·004).\n\n After 28 days, six (30%) of 20 and four (17%) of 24, respectively, had survived (p=0·054).\n\n Adverse effects were similar between groups, apart from reduction in haemoglobin, which was significantly greater in the treatment group than in the comparator group (4·32 g/L [SD 2·47] vs 2·14 g/L [1·90]; p=0·002).\n\n\nInterpretation\nIn patients with severe MERS-CoV infection, ribavirin and interferon alfa-2a therapy is associated with significantly improved survival at 14 days, but not at 28 days.\n\n Further assessment in appropriately designed randomised trials is recommended.\n\n\nFunding\nNone.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7106357","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Elsevier Ltd.","authors":[{"firstname":"Ali

The large study population was comprised of 401 cases with laboratory confirmed BUD and 826 controls, mostly family members or neighbors.\n\n\nPrincipal Findings\nAfter stratification by the three countries, two sexes and four age groups, no significant correlation was found between the presence of BCG scar and BUD status of individuals.\n\n Multivariate analysis has shown that the independent variables country (p?=?0.31), sex (p?=?0.24), age (p?=?0.96), and presence of a BCG scar (p?=?0.07) did not significantly influence the development of BUD category I or category II/III.\n\n Furthermore, the status of BCG vaccination was also not significantly related to duration of BUD or time to healing of lesions.\n\n\nConclusions\nIn our study, we did not observe significant evidence of a protective effect of routine BCG vaccination on the risk of developing either BUD or severe forms of BUD.\n\n Since accurate data on BCG strains used in these three countries were not available, no final conclusion can be drawn on the effectiveness of BCG strain in protecting against BUD.\n\n As has been suggested for tuberculosis and leprosy, well-designed prospective studies on different existing BCG vaccine strains are needed also for BUD.\n\n\n","id":"PMC4287572","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Public Library of Science","authors":[{"firstname":"Richard

Wuhan, China.\n Preventing and reversing the cytokine storm may be the key to save the patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia.\n Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have been shown to possess a comprehensive powerful immunomodulatory function.\n This study aims to investigate whether MSC transplantation improves the outcome of 7 enrolled patients with COVID-19 pneumonia in Beijing YouAn Hospital, China, from Jan 23, 2020 to Feb 16, 2020. The clinical outcomes, as well as changes of inflammatory and immune function levels and adverse effects of 7 enrolled patients were assessed for 14 days after MSC injection.\n MSCs could cure or significantly improve the functional outcomes of seven patients without observed adverse effects.\n The pulmonary function and symptoms of these seven patients were significantly improved in 2 days after MSC transplantation.\n Among them, two common and one severe patient were recovered and discharged in 10 days after treatment.\n After treatment, the peripheral lymphocytes were increased, the C-reactive protein decreased, and the overactivated cytokine-secreting immune cells CXCR3+CD4+ T cells, CXCR3+CD8+ T cells, and CXCR3+ NK cells disappeared in 3-6 days.\n In addition, a group of CD14+CD11c+CD11bmid regulatory DC cell population dramatically increased.\n Meanwhile, the level of TNF-? was significantly decreased, while IL-10 increased in MSC treatment group compared to the placebo control group.\n Furthermore, the gene expression profile showed MSCs were ACE2- and TMPRSS2- which indicated MSCs are free from COVID-19 infection.\n Thus, the intravenous transplantation of MSCs was safe and effective for treatment in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, especially for the patients in critically severe

recent advances in CAR-modified T cell immunotherapy, cost and severe toxicity have hindered its widespread use.\n To alleviate these disadvantages of CAR-modified T cell immunotherapy, additional cytotoxic cell-mediated immunotherapies are urgently needed.\n The unique biology of NK cells allows them to serve as a safe, effective, alternative immunotherapeutic strategy to CAR-modified T cells in the clinic.\n While the fundamental mechanisms underlying the cytotoxicity and side effects of CAR-modified T and NK cell immunotherapies remain poorly understood, the formation of the

Coronavirus Replicase","abstract":"Coronavirus genome replication and transcription take place at cytoplasmic membranes and involve coordinated processes of both continuous and discontinuous RNA synthesis that are mediated by the viral replicase, a huge protein complex encoded by the 20-kb replicase gene.\n The replicase complex is believed to be comprised of up to 16 viral subunits and a number of cellular proteins.\n Besides RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, RNA helicase, and protease activities, which are common to RNA viruses, the coronavirus replicase was recently predicted to employ a variety of RNA processing enzymes that are not (or extremely rarely) found in other RNA viruses and include putative sequence-specific endoribonuclease, 3?-to-5? exoribonuclease, 2?-O-ribose methyltransferase, ADP ribose 1?-phosphatase and, in a subset of group 2 coronaviruses, cyclic phosphodiesterase activities.\n This chapter reviews (1) the organization of the coronavirus replicase gene, (2) the proteolytic processing of the replicase by viral proteases, (3) the available functional and structural information on individual subunits of the replicase, such as proteases, RNA helicase, and the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, and (4) the subcellular localization of coronavirus proteins involved in RNA synthesis.\n Although many molecular details of the coronavirus life cycle remain to be investigated, the available information suggests that these viruses and their distant nidovirus relatives employ a unique collection of enzymatic activities and other protein functions to synthesize a set of 5?-leader-containing subgenomic mRNAs and to replicate the largest RNA virus genomes currently known.\n","id":"PMC7121973","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Plenum

RNA(s).\n In the case of positive-stranded RNA viruses belonging to the order Nidovirales, the RdRp resides in a replicase subunit that is unusually large.\n Bioinformatics analysis of this non-structural protein has now revealed a nidoviral signature domain (genetic marker) that is N-terminally adjacent to the RdRp and has no apparent homologs elsewhere.\n Based on its conservation profile, this domain is proposed to have nucleotidylation activity.\n We used recombinant non-structural protein 9 of the arterivirus equine arteritis virus (EAV) and different biochemical assays, including irreversible labeling with a GTP analog followed by a proteomics analysis, to demonstrate the manganese-dependent covalent binding of guanosine and uridine phosphates to a lysine/histidine residue.\n Most likely this was the invariant lysine of the newly identified domain, named nidovirus RdRp-associated nucleotidyltransferase (NiRAN), whose substitution with alanine severely diminished the described binding.\n Furthermore, this mutation crippled EAV and prevented the replication of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in cell culture, indicating that NiRAN is essential for nidoviruses.\n Potential functions supported by NiRAN may include nucleic acid ligation, mRNA capping and protein-primed RNA synthesis, possibilities that remain to be explored in future

synthetic mechanisms employed by diverse families of RNA viruses","abstract":"RNA viruses are ubiquitous in nature, infecting every known organism on the planet.\n These viruses can also be notorious human pathogens with significant medical and economic burdens.\n Central to the lifecycle of an RNA virus is the synthesis of new RNA molecules, a process that is mediated by specialized virally encoded enzymes called RNA?dependent RNA polymerases (RdRps).\n RdRps directly catalyze phosphodiester bond formation between nucleoside triphosphates in an RNA?templated manner.\n These enzymes are strikingly conserved in their structural and functional features, even among diverse RNA viruses belonging to different families.\n During host cell infection, the activities of viral RdRps are often regulated by viral cofactor proteins.\n Cofactors can modulate the type and timing of RNA synthesis by directly engaging the RdRp and/or by indirectly affecting its capacity to recognize template RNA.\n High?resolution structures of RdRps as apoenzymes, bound to RNA templates, in the midst of catalysis, and/or interacting with regulatory cofactor proteins, have dramatically increased our understanding of viral RNA synthetic mechanisms.\n Combined with elegant biochemical studies, such structures are providing a scientific platform for the rational design of antiviral agents aimed at

trial involving hospitalized adult patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, which causes the respiratory illness Covid-19, and an oxygen saturation (Sao2) of 94% or less while they were breathing ambient air or a ratio of the partial pressure of oxygen (Pao2) to the fraction of inspired oxygen (Fio2) of less than 300 mm Hg.\n\n Patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either lopinavir–ritonavir (400 mg and 100 mg, respectively) twice a day for 14 days, in addition to standard care, or standard care alone.\n\n The primary end point was the time to clinical improvement, defined as the time from randomization to either an improvement of two points on a seven-category ordinal scale or discharge from the hospital, whichever came first.\n\n\nResults\nA total of 199 patients with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection underwent randomization; 99 were assigned to the lopinavir–ritonavir group, and 100 to the standard-care group.\n\n Treatment with lopinavir–ritonavir was not associated with a difference from standard care in the time to clinical improvement (hazard ratio for clinical improvement, 1.24; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.90 to 1.72).\n\n Mortality at 28 days was similar in the lopinavir–ritonavir group and the standard-care group (19.2% vs.\n\n 25.0%; difference, ?5.8 percentage points; 95% CI, ?17.3 to 5.7).\n\n The percentages of patients with detectable viral RNA at various time points were similar.\n\n In a modified intention-to-treat analysis, lopinavir–ritonavir led to a median time to clinical improvement that was shorter by 1 day than that observed with standard care (hazard ratio, 1.39; 95% CI, 1.00 to 1.91).\n\n Gastrointestinal adverse events were more common in the lopinavir–ritonavir group, but serious adverse events were more common in the standard-care group.\n\n Lopinavir–ritonavir treatment was stopped early in 13 patients (13.8%) because of adverse events.\n\n\nConclusions\nIn hospitalized adult patients with severe Covid-19, no benefit was observed with lopinavir–ritonavir treatment beyond standard care.\n\n Future trials in patients with severe illness may help to confirm

face a complex challenge that deserves urgent intervention by all involved in medical healthcare globally.\n Conventional antiviral therapies or vaccines are the most referred means of tackling the virus, but we think establishing these ideal management strategies is presently far-fetched.\n In-house isolation or quarantine of suspected cases to keep hospital admissions manageable and prevent in-hospital spread of the virus, and promoting general awareness about transmission routes are the practical strategies used to tackle the spread of COVID-19. Cases with weakened or compromised immune systems—for example, elderly individuals, young children, and those with pre-existing conditions such as diabetes, cancer, hypertension, and chronic respiratory diseases—are particularly more susceptible to COVID-19. Hopefully, cumulative data using whole-genome sequencing of the SARS-CoV-2 genome in parallel with mathematical modeling will help the molecular biologists to understand unknown features of the pathogenesis and epidemiology of COVID-19.","id":"PMC7270650","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"IMSS.

replication, and the molecular structures and activities of viral inhibitors, we previously demonstrated that three nucleotide analogues inhibit the SARS-CoV RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp).\n Here, using polymerase extension experiments, we have demonstrated that the active triphosphate form of Sofosbuvir (a key component of the FDA approved hepatitis C drug EPCLUSA), is incorporated by SARS-CoV-2 RdRp, and blocks further incorporation.\n Using the same molecular insight, we selected the active triphosphate forms of three other anti-viral agents, Alovudine, AZT (an FDA approved HIV/AIDS drug) and Tenofovir alafenamide (TAF, an FDA approved drug for HIV and hepatitis B) for evaluation as inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 RdRp.\n We demonstrated the ability of these three viral polymerase inhibitors, 3’-fluoro-3’-deoxythymidine triphosphate, 3’-azido-3’-deoxythymidine triphosphate and Tenofovir diphosphate (the active triphosphate forms of Alovudine, AZT and TAF, respectively) to be incorporated by SARS-CoV-2 RdRp, where they also terminate further polymerase extension.\n These results offer a strong molecular basis for these nucleotide analogues to be evaluated as potential therapeutics for COVID-19.","id":"PMC7239050","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Cold Spring Harbor

SARS-CoV-2.\nMethods\nWe conducted a randomized, controlled, open-label trial involving hospitalized adult patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, which causes the respiratory illness Covid-19, and an oxygen saturation (Sao2) of 94% or less while they were breathing ambient air or a ratio of the partial pressure of oxygen (Pao2) to the fraction of inspired oxygen (Fio2) of less than 300 mm Hg.\n\n Patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either lopinavir–ritonavir (400 mg and 100 mg, respectively) twice a day for 14 days, in addition to standard care, or standard care alone.\n\n The primary end point was the time to clinical improvement, defined as the time from randomization to either an improvement of two points on a seven-category ordinal scale or discharge from the hospital, whichever came first.\n\n\nResults\nA total of 199 patients with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection underwent randomization; 99 were assigned to the lopinavir–ritonavir group, and 100 to the standard-care group.\n\n Treatment with lopinavir–ritonavir was not associated with a difference from standard care in the time to clinical improvement (hazard ratio for clinical improvement, 1.24; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.90 to 1.72).\n\n Mortality at 28 days was similar in the lopinavir–ritonavir group and the standard-care group (19.2% vs.\n\n 25.0%; difference, ?5.8 percentage points; 95% CI, ?17.3 to 5.7).\n\n The percentages of patients with detectable viral RNA at various time points were similar.\n\n In a modified intention-to-treat analysis,

Although convincing data supporting the proofreading hypothesis have been obtained, from biochemical assays and studies with CoV mutants lacking ExoN functionality, the features of ExoN from most other nidovirus families remain to be characterized.\n Remarkably, viable ExoN knockout mutants were obtained only for two CoVs, mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) and SARS-CoV, whose RNA synthesis and replication kinetics were mildly affected by the lack of ExoN function.\n In several other CoV species, ExoN inactivation was not tolerated, and knockout mutants could not be rescued when launched using a reverse genetics system.\n This suggests that ExoN is also critical for primary viral RNA synthesis, a property that poorly matches the profile of an enzyme that would merely boost long-term replication fidelity.\n In CoVs, ExoN resides in a bifunctional replicase subunit (nsp14) whose C-terminal part has (N7-guanine)-methyltransferase activity.\n The crystal structure of SARS-CoV nsp14 has shed light on the interplay between these two domains, and on nsp14’s interactions with nsp10, a co-factor that strongly enhances ExoN activity in vitro assays.\n Further elucidation of the structure-function relationships of ExoN and its interactions with other (viral and/or host) members of the CoV replication machinery will be key to understanding the enzyme’s role in viral RNA synthesis and pathogenesis, and may contribute to the design of new approaches to combat emerging nidoviruses.\n","id":"PMC6693484","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Frontiers Media S.A.","authors":[{"firstname":"Natacha S.","surname":"Ogando","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Francois","surname":"Ferron","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Etienne","surname":"Decroly","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Bruno","surname":"Canard","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Clara C.","surname":"Posthuma","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Eric J.","surname":"Snijder","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"WHO.

fingers towards the thumb subdomain, giving the viral enzyme a closed right-hand appearance.\n Six conserved structural motifs that contain key residues for the proper functioning of the enzyme have been identified in all these RNA-dependent polymerases.\n These enzymes share a two divalent metal-ion mechanism of polymerization in which two conserved aspartate residues coordinate the interactions with the metal ions to catalyze the nucleotidyl transfer reaction.\n The recent availability of crystal structures of polymerases of the Orthomyxoviridae and Bunyaviridae families allowed us to make pairwise comparisons of the tertiary structures of polymerases belonging to the four main RNA viral groups, which has led to a phylogenetic tree in which single-stranded negative RNA viral polymerases have been included for the first time.\n This has also allowed us to use a homology-based structural prediction approach to develop a general three-dimensional model of the Ebola virus RNA-dependent RNA polymerase.\n Our model includes several of the conserved structural motifs and residues described in other viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerases that define the catalytic and highly conserved palm

but no approved therapeutics are available.\n The CoV nsp14 exoribonuclease (ExoN) has complicated development of antiviral nucleosides due to its proofreading activity.\n We recently reported that the nucleoside analogue GS-5734 (remdesivir) potently inhibits human and zoonotic CoVs in vitro and in a severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) mouse model.\n However, studies with GS-5734 have not reported resistance associated with GS-5734, nor do we understand the action of GS-5734 in wild-type (WT) proofreading CoVs.\n Here, we show that GS-5734 inhibits murine hepatitis virus (MHV) with similar 50% effective concentration values (EC50) as SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV).\n Passage of WT MHV in the presence of the GS-5734 parent nucleoside selected two mutations in the nsp12 polymerase at residues conserved across all CoVs that conferred up to 5.6-fold resistance to GS-5734, as determined by EC50.\n The resistant viruses were unable to compete with WT in direct coinfection passage in the absence of GS-5734. Introduction of the MHV resistance mutations into SARS-CoV resulted in the same in vitro resistance phenotype and attenuated SARS-CoV pathogenesis in a mouse model.\n Finally, we demonstrate that an MHV mutant lacking ExoN proofreading was significantly more sensitive to GS-5734.

(b) facilitate changing data of one type based on the other (for example, using only sequence-conserved residues to match structures, or adjusting a sequence alignment based on spatial fit); (c) can be used with a researcher's own data, including arbitrary sequence alignments and annotations, closely or distantly related sets of proteins, etc.\n\n; and (d) interoperate with each other and with a full complement of molecular graphics features.\n\n We describe enhancements to UCSF Chimera to achieve these goals.\n\n\nResults\nThe molecular graphics program UCSF Chimera includes a suite of tools for interactive analyses of sequences and structures.\n\n Structures automatically associate with sequences in imported alignments, allowing many kinds of crosstalk.\n\n A novel method is provided to superimpose structures in the absence of a pre-existing sequence alignment.\n\n The method uses both sequence and secondary structure, and can match even structures with very low sequence identity.\n\n Another tool constructs structure-based sequence alignments from superpositions of two or more proteins.\n\n Chimera is designed to be extensible, and mechanisms for incorporating user-specific data without Chimera code development are also provided.\n\n\nConclusion\nThe tools described here apply to many problems involving comparison and analysis of protein structures and their sequences.\n\n Chimera includes complete documentation and is intended for use by a wide range of scientists, not just those in the computational disciplines.\n\n UCSF Chimera is free for non-commercial use and is available for Microsoft Windows, Apple Mac OS X, Linux, and other platforms from .\n\n\n","id":"PMC1570152","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"BioMed Central","authors":[{"firstname":"Elaine C","surname":"Meng","email":"meng@cgl.ucsf.edu","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Eric F","surname":"Pettersen","email":"pett@cgl.ucsf.edu","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Gregory S","surname":"Couch","email":"gregc@cgl.ucsf.edu","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Conrad C","surname":"Huang","email":"conrad@cgl.ucsf.edu","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Thomas E","surname":"Ferrin","email":"tef@cgl.ucsf.edu","contributions":"0"}]}]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Sofosbuvir and ribavirin liver pharmacokinetics in patients infected with hepatitis C virus","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[],"References depth 2":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Evaluation of the efficacy of sofosbuvir plus daclatasvir in combination with ribavirin for hospitalized COVID-19 patients with moderate disease compared with standard care: a single-centre randomized controlled trial","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[],"References depth 2":[{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Clinical features of patients infected with 2019 novel coronavirus in Wuhan, China","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"A systematic review of COVID-19 epidemiology based on current evidence","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak in Iran: actions and problems","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"WHO.

Province, China, in December 2019 and January 2020. We analyzed data on the first 425 confirmed cases in Wuhan to determine the epidemiologic characteristics of NCIP.\n\n\nMethods\nWe collected information on demographic characteristics, exposure history, and illness timelines of laboratory-confirmed cases of NCIP that had been reported by January 22, 2020. We described characteristics of the cases and estimated the key epidemiologic time-delay distributions.\n\n In the early period of exponential growth, we estimated the epidemic doubling time and the basic reproductive number.\n\n\nResults\nAmong the first 425 patients with confirmed NCIP, the median age was 59 years and 56% were male.\n\n The majority of cases (55%) with onset before January 1, 2020, were linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, as compared with 8.6% of the subsequent cases.\n\n The mean incubation period was 5.2 days (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.1 to 7.0), with the 95th percentile of the distribution at 12.5 days.\n\n In its early stages, the epidemic doubled in size every 7.4 days.\n\n With a mean serial interval of 7.5 days (95% CI, 5.3 to 19), the basic reproductive number was estimated to be 2.2 (95% CI, 1.4 to 3.9).\n\n\nConclusions\nOn the basis of this information, there is evidence that human-to-human transmission has occurred among close contacts since the middle of December 2019. Considerable efforts to reduce transmission will be required to control outbreaks if similar dynamics apply elsewhere.\n\n Measures to prevent or reduce transmission should be implemented in populations at risk.\n\n (Funded by the Ministry of Science and Technology of China and others.\n\n)\n","id":"PMC7121484","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Massachusetts Medical Society","authors":[{"firstname":"Qun","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xuhua","surname":"Guan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Peng","surname":"Wu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xiaoye","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lei","surname":"Zhou","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yeqing","surname":"Tong","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ruiqi","surname":"Ren","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Kathy S.M.","surname":"Leung","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Eric H.Y.","surname":"Lau","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jessica Y.","surname":"Wong","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xuesen","surname":"Xing","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Nijuan","surname":"Xiang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yang","surname":"Wu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Chao","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Qi","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Dan","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Tian","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jing","surname":"Zhao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Man","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Wenxiao","surname":"Tu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Chuding","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lianmei","surname":"Jin","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Rui","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Qi","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Suhua","surname":"Zhou","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Rui","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Hui","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yinbo","surname":"Luo","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yuan","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ge","surname":"Shao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Huan","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhongfa","surname":"Tao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yang","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhiqiang","surname":"Deng","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Boxi","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhitao","surname":"Ma","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yanping","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Guoqing","surname":"Shi","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Tommy T.Y.","surname":"Lam","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Joseph T.","surname":"Wu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"George F.","surname":"Gao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Benjamin J.","surname":"Cowling","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Bo","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Bo","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Gabriel M.","surname":"Leung","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zijian","surname":"Feng","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1016/S0140-6736(20)30154-9","date":"1970-01-01","title":"A familial cluster of pneumonia associated with the 2019 novel coronavirus indicating person-to-person transmission: a study of a family cluster","abstract":"Background\nAn ongoing outbreak of pneumonia associated with a novel coronavirus was reported in Wuhan city, Hubei province, China.\n\n Affected patients were geographically linked with a local wet market as a potential source.\n\n No data on person-to-person or nosocomial transmission have been published to date.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this study, we report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, radiological, and microbiological findings of five patients in a family cluster who presented with unexplained pneumonia after returning to Shenzhen, Guangdong province, China, after a visit to Wuhan, and an additional family member who did not travel to Wuhan.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of genetic sequences from these patients were done.\n\n\nFindings\nFrom Jan 10, 2020, we enrolled a family of six patients who travelled to Wuhan from Shenzhen between Dec 29, 2019 and Jan 4, 2020. Of six family members who travelled to Wuhan, five were identified as infected with the novel coronavirus.\n\n Additionally, one family member, who did not travel to Wuhan, became infected with the

family members (aged 36–66 years) presented with fever, upper or lower respiratory tract symptoms, or diarrhoea, or a combination of these 3–6 days after exposure.\n\n They presented to our hospital (The University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen) 6–10 days after symptom onset.\n\n They and one asymptomatic child (aged 10 years) had radiological ground-glass lung opacities.\n\n Older patients (aged &gt;60 years) had more systemic symptoms, extensive radiological ground-glass lung changes, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and increased C-reactive protein and lactate dehydrogenase levels.\n\n The nasopharyngeal or throat swabs of these six patients were negative for known respiratory microbes by point-of-care multiplex RT-PCR, but five patients (four adults and the child) were RT-PCR positive for genes encoding the internal RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and surface Spike protein of this novel coronavirus, which were confirmed by Sanger sequencing.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis

coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) started in December, 2019, in Wuhan, China.\n\n Information about critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection is scarce.\n\n We aimed to describe the clinical course and outcomes of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this single-centered, retrospective, observational study, we enrolled 52 critically ill adult patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia who were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) of Wuhan Jin Yin-tan hospital (Wuhan, China) between late December, 2019, and Jan 26, 2020. Demographic data, symptoms, laboratory values, comorbidities, treatments, and clinical outcomes were all collected.\n\n Data were compared between survivors and non-survivors.\n\n The primary outcome was 28-day mortality, as of Feb 9, 2020. Secondary outcomes included incidence of SARS-CoV-2-related acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and the proportion of patients requiring mechanical ventilation.\n\n\nFindings\nOf 710 patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, 52 critically ill adult patients were included.\n\n The mean age of the 52 patients was 59·7 (SD 13·3) years, 35 (67%) were men, 21 (40%) had chronic illness, 51 (98%) had fever.\n\n 32 (61·5%) patients had died at 28 days, and the median duration from admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) to death was 7 (IQR 3–11) days for non-survivors.\n\n Compared with survivors, non-survivors were older (64·6 years [11·2] vs 51·9 years [12·9]), more likely to develop ARDS (26 [81%] patients vs 9 [45%] patients), and more likely to receive mechanical ventilation (30 [94%] patients vs 7 [35%] patients), either invasively or non-invasively.\n\n Most patients had organ function damage, including 35 (67%) with ARDS, 15 (29%) with acute kidney injury, 12 (23%) with cardiac injury, 15 (29%) with liver dysfunction, and one (2%) with pneumothorax.\n\n 37 (71%) patients required mechanical ventilation.\n\n Hospital-acquired infection occurred in seven (13·5%) patients.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe mortality of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia is considerable.\n\n The survival time of the non-survivors is likely to be within 1–2 weeks after ICU admission.\n\n Older patients (&gt;65 years) with comorbidities and ARDS are at increased risk of death.\n\n The severity of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia poses great strain on critical care resources in hospitals, especially if they are not adequately staffed or resourced.\n\n\nFunding\nNone.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7102538","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Elsevier
